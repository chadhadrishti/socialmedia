0,Avoid rash driving and keep it in intact condition with regular service maintenance; good moped for daily commute.You will never feel tired with semi long rides. The pillion rider also feel comfortable with large enhanced seating and the mileage in this high fuel cost condition is affordable. The storage unit below seat is spacious as well.,Access
1,"There are not many but still very important factors1. Maintenance - Never have I received a bill less than 1800. If you get a Grazia servicing it'd cost you no more than 1500 unless there is some additional repairing to be done.2. Mileage is a burn in your pocket. (I get 30 km/l.) since beginning. (bought in 2017) Never gave more than 30 km/l. Even if you raise this to Suzuki service center, they told, you will not get no more service. If you complain they'll say that's not mentioned in the free service. Pay more.",Access
2,"1. Pricey one.2. Riding is comfortable like a car. 3. Look and performance wise good but the only draw back is heating, battery complaint, Produce over heat while running it would affect the co passenger, second battery - I bought a bike one month ago with in a month the battery goes drain, self starter is important in scooter type bikes, need improvement on this area.4. Apart from battery and heating complaint it is a nice vehicle. Pros: Comfortable for ladies, old age people.Cons: Battery complaint heating issue.",Access
3,"Best 125 cc no nonsense scooter. It got the practicality, performance, features, reliability, fuel efficiency. Rode it around 10000 km's, usually cruising around 60-70 km/h, the engine is very refined takes only few seconds to 60 km/h, easy to maneuver in start stop traffic, got everything for a daily commuter.",Access
4,"I spend extra money and bought special edition and what they don’t even give parking lock when I ask the service center they said you don’t get in special edition and  have to spend 800 rupees extra for it. There is no engine kill switch which is also disappointing you will get mileage of 30 to 35 km per liter, no point of external fuel filler still you have to get up from bike and use your key to open the fuel tank to fill the fuel.",Access
5,"Owner Drum Suzuki Access 125 brake special edition, but shows access125-bs-iv in Rc as the company did not update details properly with RTO . (done 6200 plus as of now.) had a high opinion of Suzuki, before I bought this bad bike. Advertisement Is misleading. It's a drunkard, giving only 30 km/l max. Both warranty (and extended warranty) is misleading/un-claimable, since their conditions are completely deceptive, like valid only when regular servicing done every 3000 km or 3 months whichever is earlier. At 30 km/l, you would definitely not ride that much or if somebody rides they are not valuing their money. And every time, you report your dissatisfaction, the service center will convince you that everything is alright.  Of course, the courts of law will definitely rescue you, if you have the will to sue and patience to wait. Add high insurance cost for 5 years, but value becomes nil by 5 years. Good pick up, bad braking, unless you are good driver like me. Bad lighting, neither low nor high beam on correct angle, and only one beam can be adjusted properly. Good long seating. Bad shock absorbers, especially on road bumping, worst with pillion rider. Bad riding when 40 km/h crossed with pillion, good speed  riding when single on highways (but not always as shocks and brakes are not that good)The real advice is, don't buy this bike if you value your money.",Access
6,"We bought the Bluetooth edition one on 10th Feb 2021, within two days the Bluetooth console mirror had some scratches from the corners, when we raise this concern to the dealer, they said, it may be due to external factors But the cracks are from internal and within these two-three days, we have never kept the scooter outside our home, also even in home we covered it with the bike cover, if these guys didn't provide solution, we will take this to consumer court and get a justice for this.",Access
7,"I got on December 31 2020 but I ride in speed range of 45-55, I check mileage from full to reserve (blinking in display) first got 56, second got 60, third time got 61. Service center cut my headlight wire during first service you came to know from other showroom people they also showed me what all they did and packing they have done to fix chrome design in headlight. I never faced an handle shaking issue when heavy truck pass me in very high speed (in activa 125 I have faced this issue)",Access
8,"After lot of research and throat cut comparison i have purchased this bike, look wise it is killer, comfort good, however the biggest or i should say the worst part is  it's mileage, it is really funny to see companies tag line 'kam pita he"" however i am not even getting 35 km per liter mileage.

9,"Suzuki access is one of the most appealing moped with every things are superior than activa and jupiter . 125 cc larger boot,  mileage is 55 in city, best in class.

12,A better-looking scooter for daily commuters than the traditionally bought activa by millions of family already. Not worth comparing 110 with 125 but with not much of a price difference one can easily go with access 125 bs6. But i was disappointed with its mileage which was not as expected or claimed by the company. But the power and torque figures in real-world play their part.,Access
13,"I bought access in the year 2013, the initial experience was good until it starts giving engine compression problem. The vehicle used to just turn off in the middle of the road without any warning. I pretty much pushed it more than driving. Replaced the engine cylinder and piston for around 10000 rs, but even after that it still gave me problems. So if you are thinking about buying, please ask existing owners. Do not just blindly believe the dealers. Hope this helps.",Access
14,Very bad service experience. Sudden starting problem. It is common for 125 due to its technology.Need to have compressed air and for that you have to go to mechanic.Suddenly engine stop in running condition .

17,"Suzuki access is a package in itself - great machinery, great post sales service, not too much wear and tear (depends on your handling too), etc. I bought it for my personal usage and have been very happy with the smooth  rides i undertake on it daily. The efficiency is great even if its overloaded at times. This is the 2nd time i have bought suzuki access and have been very happy with the performance.",Access
18,"I bought suzuki access after reading the expert reviews. I also test drive this scooter 2 times. But after riding 30 kms in this scooter i am not satisfied. I drove old honda activa but that feel is missing in this scooter. Access is good but not the best.Pros: 1. Seat height (uncomfortable for short people)2. Mileage 3. Smooth ride, etc.Con's: 1. Front hand bar less weight leads to waving in wind 2. Little bouncy ride/little vibrations.",Access
19,"This vehicle has more pros than cons.  Usage period: 10 months Pros: mileage i got around 50-55km if you maintain speed at 60kmph. Storage space is awesome can hold 2 helmets . One full face and one half. Always go for disc version , excellent breaking it is best  for traffic sudden breaking and highway cornering. It almost saved my life twice. Hats off to excellent breaking. Even at 50km if you apply a sudden break (front disc break ), the vehicle will be in control , will not skid. Front telescopic suspension is great. (disc + telescopic makes the vehicle not to skid)Pickup is great. travelled 422 km in a single day, pick up, braking , engine sound all perfect no issues.After sales the service is excellent.No need to worry all spares are readily available. Price is also same as honda , tvs. Cons: Rear tyre's when ages ( 8 months) skids a bit . In rainy reason you can feel it .Also some times , when you apply sudden disc break the front mud guard touches to the front nose of the fibre  body. Which tends to crack (very rarely- depends upon person driving / way of applying break).Overall its nice 2 wheeler. Blindly go for it. This vehicle is recommended only for gentle and smooth drivers and not for sporty driving.Hope this review will be useful.",Access
20,"Comparing with honda acitva, jupiter this one suzuki access 125 has very bad experience. 1st - seat is width wise broad which becomes very uncomfortable to seat. 2nd suspension is very hard(not for people average 60-70 kg) 100kg above can get good suspension due to its hardness. Foot-board is on bit higher level which is not comfortable even for me a tall guy. Petrol cap is inside seat.  So overall 1.Bad seat, 2. Bad foot-board height 3.Bad suspension. 4. Bad petrol filling design. Regretting much to have this scooty.",Access

Overall this bike failed by suzuki.,Access
22,"Excellent mileage. Maintenance cost is very low. You will have a comfortable seating for those who sit in the back. I'm 5'11 tall for me, i think leg space is bit low. You can carry groceries items very easily. You can carry a rice bag ahead and travel happily. Pickup is also nice. Bike can go upto 90kmph easily.",Access
23,We brought the scooter from chennai abt suzuki at nandanam. The staff were very polite and patient in explaining all the features. Scooter rides smooth in city with good pick up speed. Looks neat and premium. Mileage is 40 kmpl. For heavy people the scooter might feel out of balance when riding due to seat shape. Breaking is a bit uncomfortable at high speeds. Good for single rider use and commuting to office and shopping.,Access
24,Around 1 year ago i have bought suzuki access 125 from my local showroom on that time it was costing me 67000 on road price. I had a very good experience while riding my access 125 because it has a awesome pickup out of every scooty and comfortable  for driver to ride and had a very good average around 50. It doesn't require any maintenance apart from engine oil. I gave this scooty 4 stars out of 5 just because of his headlight because its kind of old-fashion which is usually not liked by young generation.,Access
25,"Long term review, purchased all new access a year back 1. Lightest 125cc scooter in the country. Its weight is 103 kgs only, that is why its mileage is high.2. Long and wide seat , very comfortable for my small family. Very huge under seat storage. My full face stud ninja fits in it without touching the seat. Also my lenovo laptop also fits in it without any hassle. 3. Front suspension is very good and real suspension is very soft and comfortable when i drive with my family.4. I was worried about the air filter issues in old access, but it was fixed in this new model. I experienced it when i drove my new access on a rainy day in delhi, with all roads full of water. It came out of deep waters without any issues. 5. Pilot lights and frond head light always remains on in this model. But they are not connected to battery, hence no issues of battery discharge. 6. Speedometer is analog, but digital display to show number of kilometers. Also has two digital trip meters which helps to know the distance between two places. 7. Handle is tall, making very upright riding position, no tiredness even after running on long journeys.8. I drove it continuously for 6 hours at the speed of 80kmph with no sign of engine effort. Top speed reached is 95kmph but since its very light weight, it is very risky. Activa and jupiter cannot go beyond 80kmph9. Mileage i am getting is 60kmpl on highways, and 50kmpl during my city travel. I travel around 40km daily on this scooter. 10. Four free service offered by company with 5 years extended warranty on engine at 700rs---Cons-1. Not fit for ladies as its taller than activa 125 and jupiter. Also the pickup is very high which ladies might not be able to handle while it starts moving from stand still. 2. After every 200 kms the accelerator setting is disturbed and had to be returned. Else it will stop when throttle is down and you may stuck in the traffic. 3. Self start is not as good as activa. 4. Sometimes it loses power while running on road. Which comes back after some time while we accelerate continuously. Reported similar issues from activa and jupiter after running 12000 kms. 5. Suzuki showrooms are limited in numbers. And they charge high for insurance. Conclusion- I use it for my long leisure journey (500kms) and daily commute to office, and also family ride to supermarkets. It has great power, comfortable sitting posture, best shock absorbers, lightest to be handled, has largest under seat storage, and giving best mileage. I'm satisfied with my purchase as it fits all my purpose which currently no other scooter can do.",Access
26,"I bought this scooter on feb 2020, after so much of research i felt this is the best scooter and i went for suzuki access 125 bs6, actually power of the scooter and mileage is  very good, but i faced some issues, first  one day horn  was not working and next day it got ready, and after few days there was problem in battery, i had issue of self start even if i do kick start at the morning and i ride for around 15 km for my office again it wont take self start, i complained about it in show room some 2 -3 times when i went they convenience me by giving full accelerator and after that it took self start, but again in 2 days same issue, they told its because of cold climate, after my 3rd visit they gave me some old stand by battery and told we will replace the battery and it took around 20 days to receive the battery, now any ways its working properly, but now the right side bulb below the indicator is not working.

29,I bought suzuki access 125 special edition bs6. Mileage is low not more than 37km. Spare parts availability is rare. If you order spare parts you will get after one month. Poor vehicle service.

30,I bought this bike june2019 and feedback oct2020.Over feeling is good but few things can be improved.1. The head light capacity has to increase. I felt with out street light driving very difficult and dangerous.2. Bike suspension to be improved. I felt even small pit make you feel like inconvenience to drive.3. Regarding mileage:  after completion of 4th servicing  giving 55 to 58 km per litter in chennai roads when you drive 40 to 55 km per hour speed limit. And service centers have to quality servicing and standards. Thank you.,Access
31,"I bought this bike in october 2017 in festive season which was suggested by the representative when he heard about full payment option, due to him i got 4k cash back and in only 4 hours got it's delivery. Staff personnel were polite and responsive. It's tall, long and comfortable. Best part is it's tyres which was 12 inches to gives a stable and confident ride. Looks descent and appealing not for a person looking for sporty or stylish scooter, pickup and acceleration is superb considering men and women driving, mileage is key factor as it's say 'cum peeta hai' which is true. Service is good but i got battery problem in its first year don't know the reason but i think it's due to the day light running/regular option. Got replacement of battery through third party but he says no further guarantee and warranty on this, which runs till this august and i purchased a new one now. You don't have much maintenance as a city ride bike but needs regular checkup after 3k km after completing free services. No such cons if you want a descent commuter and not such extraordinary one. It is a best scooter as compare to its rivals. If you think about company, service and bike don't worry about it, product is superb.",Access
32,"I have been using this scooter for the past 2 years. It has very good pickup and mileage among peers. It is easy to maintain and comfortable to ride as it weighs only 100kg. All is fine, except 3 major problems. First problem is that the drum brakes are bad  and need to be tightened every 100km or so.Second, the quality of steel used is bad as i see rusting already.Though the above 2 problems can be overlooked there is one more major issue with the scooter.The problem is with their service network. I have been to many authorized service centers but their mechanics did a poor job. I had problem with pick up and then mileage drop, which none of them were able to fix. Luckily I found a local mechanic who fixed it.",Access

38,Suzuki access-125 looks very nice and that's why i like this scooter so much. This scooter comes at an affordable price and it offers very good features. This scooter is very comfortable to ride and it can perform well for the city commute. This scooter gives good mileage also. I am using this scooter and very happy with its performance.,Access
39,"I brought access 125 in march 2015, it has a great pickup as compared to other brands. But the problem comes in mileage , if you ride it on highway it will give a good mileage of 40 to 45 but in city not more than 35. The main. Problem with access 125 is suspension, very pathetic experience. Even you can feel the back pains and lower back neck pains too much.The main cons are :-Discomfort: during long rides, it tends to become uncomfortable due to the seat being wider and considerably hard.Tyres: as mentioned in another answer, the tyres wear of pretty soon leading to slippery grip.Mechanic availability: if the bike breaks down, there is shortage in mechanics well versed with access125. Many stay away from touching your bike.Start mechanism: it does not start immediately when you try to start using the electric start after some years. Battery replacement did not help me here either.Headlight: compared to others, the headlight beam is not stronger and is focused on a smaller area.Repairs: from the past year I am experiencing starting problem and bike abruptly stops in middle of traffic. The engine gets heated and takes time to pickup.The suzuki that i own has good power and can out accelerate many scooters of that engine capacity and maybe some higher end commuter bikes.But these are designed to go for the city or at most intercity travels.The upright seating position of it makes it not very comfy to travel for more than 70 kms at a stretch.She's not designed to go fast but she's designed to be quick. She will top out at around 80 km/h and that is slow according to my highway standard.Since there is no oil cooling it will heat up faster than average sporty bikes and the tires are not designed for quick manoeuvres on the highway.Then comes the mileage of a mere 45 km/l at around 60–70 km/h(my personal observations). So the tiny 6lt petrol tank is not going to help.So look for sporty touring bikes or maybe.See every scooter has one single problem in it and that is the drive belt problem. Take jupiter, activa or any other scooter. At some point of time you will encounter this problem.Now other problem might include the spark plug problem, cooling fan problem/air intake problem as well. ( main issues in every scooters)Now talking about the access I have driven it many times. And its indeed the good scooter no doubt. It's engine is subtle, punchy at lower rpm, decent performance and the most important being an indian is mileage and it does good in that area as well.Talking about the engine problem in the access, obviously you can expect the drive belt, air intake problem. That's it. And the friend of mine who owns the access, he's not a good maintaining person of the two wheelers and he's been using the scooter for like 6 years and the scooter has the issue in the drive belt problem. That's it other than that he's having no such engine problem in it. ( bs4 version)",Access

Fuel pump got down and all service centers said we don't have this part.My vehicle was at service center more than 30 days. Poor services. Don't go for suzuki.,Access
57,"The buying experience is very good as I bought the scooter in the nighttime around 7 pm with my mother and that day i am feeling like proud that i have owned my dream scooty. As i have gone through lots of scooty showrooms and taken the test drives.Some of the scooters names will be mentioned here and what is the disadvantages of that scooty what i have seen in that:1) hero maestro fi ( basic problem is that the scooty is so much at small and while sitting in that i feel so much of uncomfortable.2) Honda activa all versions: -in this scooty what i have seen that the handle braking and handle  style are not so much different.And at last, i have gone to the Suzuki showroom which is near to my house in that i have selected two scooty that is Suzuki access 125 and Suzuki burgman, i have taken the test drive and decided what will be the price for both scooty. After deciding i have asked the price at that time the Burgman cost high so i cannot afford to buy, but the access price is near to my marking so i have booked that scooty.The riding experience with suzuki access 125 is super.About the looks of the scooty are super and the handling is awesome, the performance is also excellent.Frankly speaking, the servicing and maintenance are good from what i have seen now.Cons are: - ) in bs4 we cannot replace the headlight from halogen to led.- ) we cannot change the speedometer to get the bluetooth speedometer.",Access
58,Worst experiences. Just 4 months complete but the scooty is not useful at all. It's not starting. Self not working kick not working. The engine is very bad. Dealer is not attending to the complaints. The company is not taking any action. But my EMI gets cut every month. Do not buy.,Access
59,"I bought it about one month back. I am facing so much problem in its self start. 80% of the times i use kick to start it.  Even when it starts, sometimes it stops in midway. It was a mistake to buy it. I bought it for 97000 rupees and its not worthwhile. I am regretting now. Not recommendable. Go for some other scooter.",Access
60,Total I have done 240 km in a span of 50 days. I didn't have major problems in this. I have only one problem which is while we switch on the ignition the 3 lights glow during day and night.

61,"A very bad decision buying it. 10 days after I bought, It doesn't start only. Totally depends on scooty  sometimes, I try for half and hour, it doesn't start and then I book a cab. One day I stopped in around 2 kms from my home to buy grocery, later it did not start only. After trying for 15 minutes, I dragged it 2 kms home. You cant stop it any petrol pump, it will never start again. It just a scarp now. Just a scrap. Dealer never answers call. No number plate, no servicing, no rc.Nothing. Just a scrap of 94000.",Access
62,Self start is not working properly since one month. Don't buy Suzuki access 125. It is not worthy for its cost.

After one month I am unable to use it.,Access
63,"Purchased the vehicle from nearby showroom there is a vibration sound comes from the machine. I have mentioned the issue to service but they couldn't solve the issue. Simply waste of money in investing Suzuki access. I would rate it as 1 star for the performance it gives. I would suggest somebody to go for other brands simply by look, it's good but performance wise it's worst. Don't waste your time and money by buying this.",Access
64,Bike is good but not technological proof because starter and compression problem running with this new models..And i get nonsense reason from showroom that we changed oil outside the showroom because of that those problem is come...It means shell company manufacturing duplicate oil....I suggest to new bike user kindly choose another once instead of access 125.,Access

Service cost is economical as per other brands. The riding posture is good and has enough leg space, 3 people can easily set on the bike comfortably.

68,Bike is superb. Only major flaw is the electronic meter. Suzuki has left a tiny hole on top lid of the odometer box which directly communicates with the electronic meter. Accidentally water can seep through the hole into the meter & can damage it completely.

71,"Bought access 125 cbs special edition (silver) in july , 2018 after much deliberation and comparing it with other scooters . This i can say definitely that it is a paisa wasool product . If you want a scooter for daily city commute few will come close to it. Pros : - 1> powerful performance and peppy acceleration - you won't realise when you reach 40 kmph.2> frugal  - when driven sensibly within the speed limits in eco mode , gives 50+ mileage after 2 servicing.3> retro look and feel -  chrome treatment on front along with silver colour and contrasting black wheels give it a classic look.4> smooth suspension and comfort - with telescopic front suspension ( missing on activa 110 ) , the bike feels as if you are riding a plush sofa on smooth tarmac.5> lots of space in the boot to keep documents , hooks to hang daily use items. Cons : - 1> lack of led lighting 2> no external fuel filling option.If you are looking for a classic scooter which is very practical and also has excellent performance , look no further . Suzuki has this remarkable product and i truly believe it should do the sales figure activa is doing right now.",Access

73,"Looks are great but you know looks doesn’t matter. You need a beast under that pillion that is your engine. Riding experience is good but not reliable at all after your warranty finishes. The bike worked perfectly for 2 years. But the real story starts after it ; the thing about bikes is if their engines has less engine oil it starts to produce smoke from silencer. But this bike never did a thing and while riding it stopped working on its own. Its kick was jammed and nothing was working. Then a visit to service centre told us that the engine has stalled and everything inside needs to be changed like block cranks and piston ,that means new engine parts. And the cost told was 15000 for them. And the best part about it was they take 5000? as security deposit before opening the engine, i never understood this part. I serviced that bike but in 6 months again the bike started to produce unbearable amount of smoke from silencer and the pillion side becomes too hot. Then i serviced that engine outside the service centre and it costed me again 8000?. It was all perfect but in one year the same thing happened and i took to another servicing shop and he took again 8000? for parts inside. Now few days back i got to know that the timing chain of the engine has came of the disk and need to be fixed that costs me more of 1000.  That means whatever the mechanic is doing the job the bike would be good for couple of months and later all back to square one. And if you don't believe me just get outside your house and ask any mechanic if they would like to fix an access. They most of the time says no. In case he says yes then ask is there any problem with access engines he would tell you his past experience regarding the bike and you will know ultimately. There is such bad history about the bike.  You would thank me later. Also it is not covered under insurance that means your new insurance for 5000? for 5 years is all gone in water. Other companies engines are not that complicated as of access so all if others need less time and manpower and will cost you just dimes if there is problem and would be fine for life. But this bike costed me double of what i paid for in starting. Just do research on outside the service centre about this bike to your nearest mechanic ; they will say the mechanic would have not done his job properly but you know they all say same things. So save money and go for alternative options.",Access

There is some vibration on heavy braking from the front, something the service center hasn't been able to figure out but that's manageable.

Engine. Mine has started burning oil with the tell-tale black suit and white smoke from the exhaust, at about 6k kms ! Makes me wonder what was done to shave off the 6kgs from the engine. Another interesting thing is that the oil filter has been removed ! feels like the pursuit of weight saving and fuel efficiency has affected the reliability.Suzuki should take note of all the issues being reported in their workshops and forums like bikewale and take corrective action. Coming from a generation which respected suzuki for their brilliant engines and gearboxes this comes as a shocker.Pros : fresh looks, comfortable ride, good storage space.Cons : engine reliability, maintenance.",Access

This scooty has one main cons i.E. Its low average and battery provided..... Most of the times access ignition automatically offs even while u r riding and sometimes the electric start doesn't works. At every service i told the service center guys about the problem and they didn't even bother and rectify that.So guys please think before you buy any two wheeler and i suggest you before buying any two wheeler please visit there service center for full information because owner's will tell u the truth about any vehicle what they are facing problem or happy with it.",Access
130,"I had bought access 125 in 2018 since then never faced any problems regarding the engine even in the worst rainy season. the best part of access 125 is engine performance. The main feature is it has the longest seat in this segment of 125cc scooters. The suspension could have been better but due to smaller tyres (compared to bikes) impact of potholes or bad roads will be more compared to bikes. It is advisable that servicing should be done through Suzuki service centres only. Overall a good scooty with the scope for improvement in the area of comfort (suspension, bigger tyres).",Access

141,"Buying experience: brought this scooter for daily purposes. Sales-people were insisting on the drum brake version as it is best for rough muddy terrain and as we live in a rural area, some roads here are unpaved and disc brake which is not suitable for this kind of roads are more prone to getting skid while hard braking.But after riding both the disc and drum versions, we decided to buy the ride edition as it had a digital cluster and looked premium and my parents don't drive that fast either.Riding experience: very nice scooter, no issues till now, the ride is stiff, can't go on longer rides. For city use it's perfect, the ride position is great, hooks are provided for hanging groceries, and inner seat storage is ok for a cheap full-size helmet. Mirrors provided in the special edition and ride edition are chrome-plated circular mirrors, doesn't provide many views but its manageable. My parents didn't have any issues while riding.Details about looks, and performance: based on my family's opinion this scooter looks old-fashioned but still attractive. In terms of performance, the throttle response is good and very agile. Doesn't struggle on slopes even if fully occupied with co-passenger and luggage it climbs smoothly. Vibration can be felt at high rpm and the engine can be vocal after 80 kph. Digital cluster is way better than those analogues provided in lower variant. The Headlight position is good, the view is clear at night, and got no issues while riding on a low beam.Servicing and maintenance: initial service cost was 1500 which was an oil change and labor, although it is termed as free service they still charge you for the consumables and work, which is common even if you buy other brand motorcycles. I think suzuki's service costs are higher than the other competitors. Pros : 1. Great mileage in the city - 45kph tested2. Feels sturdy.3. Very practical scooter, more leg room, can carry medium-sized trolley bags/cylinders 4. Nice instrument cluster display ( for ride connect edition ) Cons.1. Mapmy India integration in Suzuki ride connect app is not very functional, should have integrated with google maps ( for the ride connect edition )  2. Stiff suspension, not comfortable for long rides3. External fuel filler cap is not accessible from the handlebar, need to get off the scooter in order to open the cap.4. Not much functionality is provided for the suzuki ride connect app, quite useless in practicalityOverall opinion: if you're on a budget and want a Suzuki access then you can go for the drum edition or special edition. I brought the ride to connect edition only because of the sleek digital display. The Bluetooth connect functionality in the display cluster is not what I use every time, so kind of useless and doesn't have much functionality apart from turn-by-turn navigation which is absurd because of the mapmy India navigation app.",Access

Riding experience :-This scooty is not for people having short heighted people, this is pretty large and light weight only 102kgs (about 8 kgs less than activa and 1 kg less than activa i(lol)) , have metal  in its front mud guard , its seats are quite comfortable , headlamps are not so bright , suspensions are pretty good , got a nice ground clearance, awesome pickup speed(0-60kmph in 7 secs) and great mileage 50-60 kmpl (on average speeds like 40-70kmph) and have good top speed.3.

163,"I was in market for an automatic scooter, with stop and go city traffic, a scooter was more suited for me for the daily office commutes. I wanted a scooter with better front suspension, and after couple of test drives, decided on all new suzuki access 125. The whole test drive and buying experience was great, the people at midas suzuki, malakpet, hyderabad treated me well, they were informative and helpful. On 28th august, 2016 took the delivery and have been using suzuki access for my daily commutes ever since. From day one, i was impressed with the ride quality of the scooter, coming from a 150cc bike, i thought there would be lots of adjustments to be made to ride it comfortably, but to my surprise, a little change in seating position and posture was all it took. I never felt need for power on the scooter, as it zipped through traffic with ease. It is quite manoeuvrable, and tractable on the city roads as well. The most impressive thing of all about the scooter for me is it's balance, i have ridden few other scooters in the past, but access 125 is the most balanced scooter that i, personally have ever rode. Initially, looks were the first thing that attracted me towards the access 125, for me suzuki have taken few cues from vespa in design aspects, in a good way that is, the modern retro looks were quite attractive for me, the scooter is neutral in design, suiting both the genders. As far as performance is concerned, like i said, i never felt need for more power, it's really zippy and the rubber band effect which is evident in any cvt scooter, is minimal in this one, so i am happy with it. As far as fuel economy is concerned, with my aggressive riding and in city start stop traffic i am getting around 40 kmpl, which i must say isn't satisfactory, particularly keeping in mind the 64 kmpl claim that suzuki made. With light hand on accelerator you may fetch around 45-50.I have had mixed bag of experiences when it comes to servicing of the vehicle, as we all know, expecting a lot from any authorised service centre will leave you disappointed. But there are occasions where the works in job card were not taken care of, and i had to remind them about it when i go to get the vehicle. The speedometer on the scooter wasn't working properly, as it will not show the actual speed in the console, when raised a complaint, i was told the speedometer sensor was at fault and the whole console has to be changed. But the standard procedure required a company technician to come and check it to give it a green signal for replacement, which took quite some time, and required few calls from my side to the service centre and few mails and tweets to suzuki customer care which went to deaf ears. Barring these, the experiences with service were quite like other service companies' service centre. Pros:Very comfortable to ride, zippy; in fact in the official bikewale head to head comparisons this scoot gave aprilia sr150 run for its money, balance, looks, long seat and lots of storage space. Almost forgot to mention it's brakes, mine is a disc brake variant, and it stops like a dream for a scooter!Cons:Mileage not up to company claims, paint quality is not up to suzuki's standards. Overall i am very satisfied with the scooter, it's a wholesome package for city commuting from suzuki. ",Access

165,"After lots of comparisons and research, I have finalized Suzuki access125. Handing is very good, and easy to maneuver in traffic good. But on Highway or in open roads it wobbles at low speed too.The suspension is very stiffer. Around 4 km I have daily travel on broken rodes. It needs to be a little soft or just above mid settings Talking about seating position and seat, the seat is spacious but not comfortable and needs more cushion The position is okay some people like it, but someone don't like cause of the high handlebar.Looks very nice and classic, plastic panels could be better, near the rear foot pegs,  without any crash they broke. The paint quality on my scooter is not good which is matt silver. The area beside the seat is fainted, and washed.And the best part is the engine. The initial is superb in the middle is also good. But in the top end, it's lacking. It gets quickly to 50 to 60 mph, Some times till 70 km and then it takes lots of time To go on 90 and above. Looks classic but also has some hooligan in itself. Servicing and maintenance It's slightly costly considering other brands. Except for Yamaha.In rural areas or in small towns it's not easy availability of parts And service stations.Considering Suzuki instrument consoles I have got 45 to 55 kmpl mileage but I have doubts. There is almost a 20 percent of error in the trip meter. 8 km running shows 10 kmProns1. Good engine 2. Looks 3. handling 4. Overall performance Cons1. Suspension 2. seat cushioning 3.

I found that the battery is faulty. The service center just recharged the battery.3) uncomfortable ride: the rear suspension of the scooter is so stiff that it gives back pain even in short rides.

174,"Buying experience: simple and hassle-free (aryan suzuki, old airport road bangalore). Riding experience: pure joy, I've ridden most scooters being sold in india, none of them match the comfort, stability and performance of the access. The suspension set-up is so perfect that the jolts of bangalore traffic are evened out, yet, if you want to corner like a lunatic (on a scooter), this thing gives the perfect balance such that lean angles are quite acute for a scooter. It is so much better than the honda activa and the only scooter that matches its suspension set-up is the aprilia which way more expensive. Even for the pillion rider this thing is very comfortable. My mom enjoys sitting on the access more than any other vehicle that my brother or me have owned.Brakes are drum in my version. They have good bite and feedback, and give enough lock that if you want to slide a bit the vehicle allows you to. The chassis provides so much control that it quite easy to manoeuvre no matter what the speed. Coming from riding bigger motorcycles, i never felt lacking with the access. It truly is a do it all machine. Other than the power department, i never felt like wanting a bigger motorcycle, even in terms of power, if you understand how to work the throttle, you can give many guys on motorcycles jitters with how fast this thing takes off. The throttle response is instant but it takes understanding the gearbox to work the throttle to get the best performance out of this vehicle.Details about looks, performance etc: I've highlighted performance in the previous section and don't wish to do so again. Regarding looks, well, it's good looking but i found the vintage version (which i don't have) to be beautiful, other than that the bike stands out from other vehicles in a parking lot and also in traffic, although the latter is due to this being the fastest scooter you see (insert smiley). Practicality is one place where i find the access a little lacking, the boot is not big enough to hold any helmet of more reputed and affluent brands. Does pack a lot of stuff though.Servicing and maintenance: servicing has been hassle free with my dealer, although their constant calls when service is due is a bit nagging. Maintenance costs have been minimal as of now. With only one part not functioning properly which was the accessory charger, which was an easy, cost-free fix.  In a nutshell, a wonderful ownership experience. And now I've got to go and answer the service call....Pros : Big and fitting scooter for a bigger rider like me Great performance for its classGood balance of performance and fuel efficiencyGreat chassisGreat bikeIt's a suzuki, maintenance is japan-class, never broken till date, likely to never breakGround clearance is enough to ride the vehicle in india, without scrapping, unlike some scooters and motorcycles..Cons :Too big for smaller riders like my sister-in-lawPower can be overwhelming initially for those not used to it (my father)Horrible stock tyres (mrf)Headlamp, might as well be blind in the night..They are bad..Drum brakes do tend to lock, especially the rear, if controlled is fun, otherwise leads to a horrid accident.",Access
175,"Suzuki Access 125 is no doubt a good scooter. Great power, good mileage and low maintenance. Everything feels great but talking about comfort then I will say the suspension is a bit stiffer, and you can feel the road most of the time. And good build quality at an affordable price. The best seat cushion, makes you tired free on your long ride too.",Access
176,"I had an amazing experience with access 125. Really want to buy this once again as I already sold my older one. Performance is really good. Pickup is at next level. Mileage could be better, somehow 40 was brilliant. Visual appearance at its best. Seating space is good. Comfortable for long rides too.",Access

Very comfortable 3. Good looks4. Large place in boot5. Stylish lamps6. Comfort for all generations ,Access
178,The mileage told by the company is 65 but i am getting less than 40...But except this other things are okay and the riding experience is so good and is easy to use in traffic......And less maintenance is required......and different stunning colors are available.....Good performance except this mileage issue......,Access
179,"I bought my bike around mid-2019 and at first, I used it very carefully I like the color and design of my bike as was a blue color.Firstly I used my bike occasionally only on weekends after a few weeks I used it on my daily up and down traveling from home to the office around 20 to 25 kilometers daily it gives me more comfort to come home safely.Look wise it is very decent and sober, it gives you the best performances for eg mileage I get on my bike was around 55kmpl which is quite good for me and the seat is also quite good and the space in front for luggage is much better than activa and other scootersPros: good mileage,nice luggage space Cons: sometimes couldn't start if you ride non-stop for more than 80km.",Access
180,"The buying experience was good. Pros - looks stylish and the white colour of the special edition is unique and stands different out of all the colours. Storage space is good. Usb point is very slow for phone charging but it's good for emergencies. The seat is huge too and a good fit for healthy people 2 healthy people can still sit comfortably.Cons: riding experience was ok at the beginning, the bike is lightweight and is not stable while riding at a speed especially when a huge vehicle is passing from the opposite direction in speed(narrow roads of the village), the scooty literally shakes which is very risky. Mileage issue. Was told it will give more than 50 but not even getting 40 after riding it for 500+kmThe space for petrol is very confusing. U have to still get down and open the petrol lock and while putting it back it's difficult and confusing too and not sure why they gave so much useless space in the tank.Overall it's an ok thing. My suggestion is to check more reviews and compare this one with Jupiter before buying it.",Access
181,"Pros:1. Good Front space for carrying things. You can fit maximum 1 domestic lpg cylinder side ways.2. Comfortable Seating3. Good mileage. I travel avg 120 kms per week. So I always keep rs 300 or sometimes rs 200 for fuel per week.Cons:1. Braking takes too long. You can't ride very fast2. I don't know why but the tyres always slips especially on water. You can't just bend around, you have to ride like a grandpa.3. Fuel injection problem after 6000 kms. My local mechanic helped solve this by taking out the FI choke light connected to the start spring. I don't know how to explain this better but you will get my point if you own one.4. For the average Indian, the parts are expensive plus the original parts don't last long. So I just buy the duplicate versions which are cheap but very good for me. For example, price of Disc pads is approx. Rs. 1200 inclusive GST while in local shop it is Rs. 220 (with bargaining) but very good quality. If you know where to get your parts, it is well and good.5. Service centres will try to milk you for every little bit of money they can get while doing free servicing. They will try to change air filters, disc pads, start plug etc., when not needed. Be vigilant and don't allow such things.",Access
182,"The staring problem is gone when the battery was replaced, but it's reoccurring now and then. Servicing is a nightmare. There is vibration while moving the scooter from idle, but the issue is never attended to by the service. If the scooter is driven at a higher speed continuously, the piston gets jammed. We can't use self/kick to fix this. Once the engine cools down in 30mins to 1 hour, the issue is resolved automatically.",Access

I purchased it  recently after it was launched .The suspension are little stiffer ,which means mostly at low speed and when riding alone the ride seems to be too bouncy,if you mostly travel alone ,then the new access isn't made for you .Overall pros 1. Best acceleration [believe me the acceleration is the best part of new access]2.Mileage [isn't the best but good ]3.Seat comfort [the new access got really big and wide seat,best option during long tours ] 4.It got the biggest trunk under the seat i had ever seen 5. Fuel tank capacity more then 6 liters.Overall cons 1.If you have ever ride the new access then you may know it got a problem with the battery or the switch,it takes few seconds to respond every time you press the start button,this is the biggest problem of the new access,secondly if you give it a harsh acceleration initially then it will switch off ,mostly irritating  in traffic,when i accelerate it with a little more torque with my hand it gets off and then it takes time to start again.2. I  personally don't feel too confident while cornering and during a regular drive. In short the access doesn't seems to be under your control ,i don't know why ,it seems to be over powered ,the acceleration is too sensitive .Riding a activa is better ,it is really hard to predict the limits of the new access .Conclusion the new access would be a good option only  if you ride with someone {not alone}  and if acceleration is too important for you ,i personally love my access,it got everything i need .",Access

Back tyre is 10 inch and front is 12 , so its very awkward riding position.Very regularly back tyre gets flat as full load is on back, only benefit is its pick up is good due to short tyre.

At every service i told the service centre guys about the problem and they didn't even bother and rectify that.So guys please think before you buy any two wheeler and i suggest you before buying any two wheeler please visit their service centre for full information because owner's will tell you the truth about any vehicle what they are facing problem or happy with it.",Access

274,"I could never not stop talking about my access. I used for office commutes, city rides, family shopping trip, and tours. When i say tours i mean serious business. Apart from plains i have conquered lots of hills in himanchal's chamba, manali, kullu, kinnaur, lahul & spiti and also mighty 'ladhakh' these are dream places of almost every serious biker. I have made trips with pillion & solo as well. This scooter just never disappoints! it has conquered, tarmac, sand, pebbles, rocks, water crossings, snow, sleet & altitudes up to 5359 meters (khardung la). I never expect more than it could offer(i know a scooter running on cvt behaves), so my expectations are always over exceeded. I have covered more than 500 kms in a day on multiple occasions. Max i drove 823 kms in a day which included 457 kms on himanchal's hills. 'fuel efficiency' i see a lot of negative comments. In my experience, it reciprocates the way i wring the throttle. If i continuously demand max performance it returns 30-35 kmpl. Averaging less than 60 kmph with no suddne n throttle pull, i was able to extract more than 55 kmpl. In total i have ridden a little 26,000 kms, and i fall in lover with this scooter on every trip. Maximum load laden on this poor baby was two adults, two children, and a full lpg cylinder, it still performed like a stallion. So 6 stars for the machine. Only reason i gave four stars is that dealerships/servicing could be better dealt with. But i guess that is more to do with people, rather than suzuki.

Paint used is of superb quality which gives you a perfect shine. It is lightweight plus its powerful which makes it one of the fastest scooters in the 125 cc segment (besides ntorq).

Less than a year the battery has stopped working. I went to the showroom with loss of pay and all they could want me is give it for service, they call me in the evening to inform that the battery is not working you need to contact battery dealer.

405,"Just i purchased suzuki access 125 after comparing both technical, utility and cost of other scooterates. I'm happy with the vehicle in respect of both performance and value for money.However, i had incorporated some changes/additions in my suzuki access 125 to get more utility from the vehicle. Though the following actions of mine may void the warranty on my vehicle, i'm not bothered about it.1. Changing of headlight bulb:-I got changed my stock hologen bulb - a.C. 35w with 42w led bulb (d.C.) - cost rs.600/- with slight wiring. Now my vehicle headlight gives me almost 5 times more light then stock bulb.2. Installation of headlight on/off switch:-There is a provision provided to fix a switch in the right hand side (near throttle) of the suzuki access 125. I got fixed honda activa headlight on-off switch (cost rs. 60/-) with slight wiring. Now as soon as i start my vehicle, the front parking lights glow (at headlight off position) thus complying with bs 4 standards. And i can switch on & off my vehicle headlight at my wish.3. Replacing stock parking and indicator bulbs with led bulbs:-I had replaced these bulbs with led bulbs at a cost of rs.180/- without any wiring work. A flasher (rs.70/-) has been fixed along with a buzzer (rs.30/-). However, back side break light remains a.C. Stock bulb only.4. Replacing stock city-cum-highway light switch with pass switch:-A tvs jupiter pass switch is replaced (cost rs. 98/-) against stock city-cum-highway light switch which perfectly fitted. This will work for all 3 functions i.E. City light, highway light and pass light. Slight wiring is done.5. Fixing of engine off/kill switch:-This needs careful electrical skill for wiring. An ""anupam"" brand on-off switch (cost rs.35/-) has been installed just above the headlight on-off switch. Now without touching my vehicle key, i can switch off the running vehicle with gentle press of my thumb.6. Replacing stock single horn with double horn:-Replaced with minda double horn (high & low) at rs.325/- with cut out (rs.120/-) by slight wiring work.7. Got fixed mobile charger-cum-holder at rs.500/- to my left mirror.The total labour paid for electrical work is 1k.I just purchased and yet to know the mileage of the vehicle. But i'm totally satisfied with the top class performance of engine and above additions.",Access

440,"Hi guys, my good experience with suzuki access 125 good looking, best mileage,very comfortable riding, being a freelance bike reviewer i wait for longer time and took even more rides, finally i find out all the pros and cons. After riding this scooter in city as well as in highway for about 400 km cumulatively, today i am reviewing this. Suzuki access being the highest selling scooter in the market, with the bs 4 norms suzuki launched fourth generation access which named as access 125 Riding experience:The first thing is the ergonomics, this scooter has got ample leg space and it means taller rider are comfortable. The speedometer console along with fuel gauge is decent looking but misses the funky looking part digital console as in most of the scooter in this range. The bulky looking all steel body looks good and both males and females would like it. The 125cc with a maximum power of 8 bhp is quit a responsive and well refined unit. This scooter goes up to 70 kph with ease and with a top speed of 90kph. Braking is not all that good and i would prefer a disc brake standard across all activa model, but the advance braking system this is the added safety feature. The turning radius is decent in this scooter so a lack of confidence stays while taking sharp turns in city traffic.Details about looks, performance suzuki access  targeted both male and female riders with its bulky looks so everyone will enjoy riding this scooter. The speedometer and fuel comes with full analogue console without trip meters. In the fourth generation suzuki the remarkable change is nothing except bs 4 norms and aho feature. Performance as i mentioned earlier is as good as to expect from a 125 cc scooter. This engine is very refined. Practicality is good, it gets about 22 liters of boot space under the seat. It also gets mobile charging port.Servicing and maintenance:The maintenance of this bike is very cheap, it gets six free servicing and there after every 3000 km which is also a very nominal amount. The engine oil and air filter needs to be change every after 6000 to 7000 km and spark plug after 12000 km.Pros: refined engine, low maintenance, fuel economy.Cons: looks, outdated console, under seat fuel lid.",Access
441,I have great experience with my access 125 special edition. It is very comfortable and very user friendly to handle the bike. This is bullet in gear less vehicle. Get more mileage pulling. In this editions mirror is spectacular no words. Disk brake front brake is very controllable. Luggage capacity is high we can store . Two hangers in front...Any way it is a nice vehicle.,Access

I would say this scooter looks great as a millennials i like it very much.Its design also attract new generation youngsters.A complete retro machine.4. You don't worry about the service and maintenance until you ride it in a good manners as recommend.Even harsh driving doesn't make any impact on the parts.Quality of material is top notch(its suzuki just believe blind ).Pros : value for money,more storage Cons: need more fuel storage 8 litres.(as my view).",Access

451,"Was just a searching for a scooter to buy , then i decided to buy the all new access 125.I was just awesome .Its engine is the most powerful engine than an scooter should have.It gives an mileage of 59 to 60 which is best than bikes.Maintenance free with superb speeding and braking combo.It will never upset you.But one thing is certain, the all-new access 125 looks big, and quite handsome. It's cut out in gracious lines rather than being fashionably hip and doesn't make a loud, brash statement.Suzuki says under seat storage is best-in-class at 21 litres. It can accommodate a small bag, a book or two and a full face helmet, all within the same space! what is sorely missed is a usb power socket; although there's space for an optional power socket, you will have to get that installed at your own cost, not at the dealer, but out in the grey market.What company says that there are no surprises when you thumb the starter; the engine settles into a reassuring hum and the scooter pulls cleanly, accelerating without any sense of feeling strained or without any vibrations creeping in. The engine is a new one - with sep technology or suzuki eco performance, which reduces friction among the moving parts and is also said to improve fuel economy. The overall displacement remains the same at 124cc, and makes the same amount of power - 8.58bhp at 7,000rpm. But it makes marginally more torque now - 10.2nm at 5000rpm. What also impressed us is the ride quality. The wide and long seat is plush and comfortable and it's suitably complemented by the suspension. All sorts of bumps are absorbed quite nicely, so potholes and minor road undulations are taken care of without any judders.",Access

458,"Bike is very good, sturdy and low maintenance. Driving access 125 for almost 1.5 years now with no issues. I wanted to purchase a bike with good suspension and i am very satisfied with this bike. Mileage is a big issue, company reported 64 kmpl but in reality it gives between 40-44 kmpl. Company should report right mileage after user reviews, ideally there shouldn't be so much gap in what is reported / marketed (64 kmpl) by company and actually experienced (~42 kmpl) by customers.",Access

463,Just recently the engine got seized without no reason. I got it serviced every 3000 km or 3 months and too good care. But just 2 days ago without no prior intimation the engine seized causing unnecessary suffering. Every time i took this scooty for servicing the mechanics hated this machine like anything. Saying there is design failure of putting the filter on top of the tyre which makes it very dirty and cause problems. The  the engine tuning is terrible.Also i had the problems of scooty stopping while driving the moment you leave the race. Overall performance is ok but maintenance issues are lot.I hope they will rectify. This seizure has caused 6k. Not happy.,Access

The franchisee was helpful and was made available in decent time.The look is compact, sturdy and decent in style, seat is at low height so comfortable for 5'0"" people. Less effort is required for moving the handle when compared to its competitors and pickup is also better and fuel efficiency decently to be around 35-40 at the age of 2-3 years.Servicing and maintenance if done regularly (every 3-5 months irrespective of distance travelled) would lead to a better life and lesser problems.Pros: good pickup, less effort in moving the handle, lower seat height, sturdy shape Cons: less storage space, decent in style (look), buttons on handle not upto the mark, difficult for self cleaning as its shape is compact.",Access

479,Its an european designed scooty.  So you cannot experience it with the same  sports style scooty.  Depend upon the personal choices.  Whereas the engine refinement is the best over all scooties.  The pickup is the most superior feature.  The race response is too good.  Which is hence needed in daily usage in city while overtaking etc.  The pocket in front is also very necessary for keeping bottle or main items.  Without opening the boot of the scooty.  Hence also provided a dc charging point which help in charging phone while riding.  U can easily open boot of the scooty by just pressing the key downwards.  Whereas the front telescopic suspension provided a comfortable ride in city as well as off road.  It will film up the road gaps easily....,Access

536,"A slight upgrade on the older version on the access, the new 125 definitely retains the most of the positives from it's predecessor. However there a few things which make the bike a little cumbersomepros 1) priced competitively2)a very smooth and refined engine3) fuel efficient 4) feels powerful and stable at all timecons1) doesn't come with a guard around around head and tail lamps2) seat is a bit too high for the average rider, woman may find this a bit inconvenient 3) suzuki don't offer the best service experience",Access
537,Suzuki access is the best family scooter because of more storage larger seat.The design is a part in which suzuki has done a great work the design is very classy. The chrome used in headlights are very interactive. It is very light scooter which also improve milage and pickup of the scooter.   Performance the pickup is good engine is very smooth the overtaking is good and break suspension is also nice.The lights and indicators are very excillent i use this scooter of around 1000 km and i did 2 service and after this scooter give great milage and performance the cons of scooter account to me is-not full metal body display -do not have external fuel filling-automatic lights missedthe cons are very minor but if you want a family scooter then go for it,Access

539,This vehicle is extremely smooth and it have a good engine noise which i like. Coming to the brake the get loose a bit quick when u buy so time to time servicing is very important.It comes with huge beautiful colour.The down point is that it doesn't have that good average. Suzuki say that it give 64 kmph average but trust me 50 is more than enough. Coming to the vehicle it's very spacious a big space inside seat.And also has a good look the glossy one.So that's it ,Access
540,After buying the vehicle gave a feedback stating that it has a carry hook in bottom of seat and there is no charger holder. Both are rectified in r&d and recent vehicles has got that. Many would have given the same feedback and it is great to know that even minor feedback are noted down. Even after service is really good and if you constantly change the break oil vehicle is so perfect to ride,Access

So what good than a scooter, no frequent gear shifts and clutch controls, yes i am lazy.Suzuki access was the most powerful scooter withing the segment with decent looks and mileage too.I was able to get a mileage of around 35 before 1st service and then it went all the way up to 43kmpl.Riding experience on this bike is decent too. Nothing special except the torque, but you wont be disappointed as well.There is no running cost for this except your fuel and maintenance cost is within limits as well.Pros : good brakes, alloy wheels on top model, more torque, good mileageCons : back aches after a period of continuous driving, but i guess that is a problem with all scooters. Go for a decent bike if you are planning to long period drives.Overall its a decent package which won't disappoint you. Go for it :)",Access

600,"Not going into the deeper or more comprehensive types of reviews, I bought this scooter for the sole reason of it's pick up and power, and speaking honestly, it doesn't disappoint. The throttle response gets slow as the amount of fuel in your tank decreases. The ride quality is appalling at full pressure of the tyres (which is 22/29 psi front/back). On a bumpy road, your back will give out due to it's poor ride quality but on a smooth and open road, you won't be able to resist smiling as your the gust of wind hits you as you cross 75kmph pretty easily. I have topped it at 89kmph almost effortlessly. The mileage it gives me hovers around 45kmpl to 50kmpl and I easily rack up to 40 kilometers per day. An advantage of having the disc brake version is the peace of mind it offers, having a disc brake gives good control to the rider and is pretty high up on safety, after all, these are Indian roads. I don't have any other complaints about the vehicle, it is astonishingly strong on the basis of engine performance and sturdiness. Though, heavier than Activa 5G, it doesn't really lose any pick up. The storage is quite impressive, as it stores a lot of stuff I carry around, ranging from winter jackets to helmets and books, there's always room for more. About the servicing, Suzuki gives the standard four free services and then paid services. I've had three free services done, and all of them were well executed and finished and you can notice the change in engine performance after the service. For maintenance, I usually wash it with a water hose every Sunday, using gentle car surface soap and microfibre cloths to keep it clean and shining. Engine maintenance doesn't require much, just regular engine oil replacement. The disadvantage is the ride quality at high pressure, but there is a workaround for that too, just reduce the tyre pressure a little and you should be riding much better.",Access
601,I bought it on 16 aug 2017. I drove it 2500 kms. I am getting mileage of 45 in riding economy speed.

603,This scooty is fast and have really amazing acceleration compare to other scooty like activa. It's powerful and withstand heavy load.

604,"I bought Suzuki access 125 after comparing it with Jupiter, n-torque, Aprilia 150 and Cygnus x-ray. I was very confused between access and Cygnus x-ray but finally gave in for access for two reasons, superb braking system and it's a good family scooter (which is the main reason for purchase). Riding access is pure pleasure because of the great suspension it provides and the 125cc helps run it at a good 60+ speed very comfortably.  On highways it even touches 80kmph and still stays very much in control. The turns are perfect and maneuvering is very easy. About it's looks, obviously Cygnus and N-torq look insanely superb compared to access and if you are for looks then this scooter is not for you, but again it's not meant to be the super sexy scooter. With good mileage and a bigger seat, you love the drive on access 125. The better suspension gives you good control in potholes and there is enough space for a kid to stand at the front when you ride it with kid.I recently got it serviced and there was a waiting of 3/4 hours for basic oil change but again, i went there on weekend so nothing much to complain. It's too early to talk about the maintenance as it's just over 2 months that i have used it but it is giving me good 40kmpl mileage.Pros:- family scooter- good suspension- very reliable and comfortable at high speeds- big boot for helmet. Cons:- looks are not to attract the younger crowd- missing thinks like digital watch (even Tvs Wego has it), and latest features like bluetooth- the company steel guard is horrible as it comes right on top of kicker and you might hurt your leg while kick-starting the scooter- pillion rider seat is little down as compared to other scooters.",Access

Another good thing is it has front pocket  where anyone can easily keep a mobile phone or a small water bottle. Only disadvantage of this vehicle that i feel till now in my 700-800 km ride that it does not have the external fuel filling system. Everytime you have to open the seat in the time of refilling.

640,"First ill write pros as they are very less 1) good n powerful engine2) good pick up and mileage3) good body styling 4) large boot space: Cons1) headlight doom has manufacturing defect and you'll hear a shaking sound always. The clip system is bad n breaks2) front fork is a failure, due to manage battery space fork has been shifted a bit and keeps getting lose often, constant maintenance is required. 3) disk brake. Although a boon, but suzuki might have opted for a new player to provide disk brakes and hence it doesn't work effectively especially with combi brake system4) there is a huge problem in engine and clutch. You can hear a constant brushing of something every time u give accelerator. Surprisingly i haven't heard this from anyone who wrote the review. I tested and used access 125, new show room access and my vehicle, all have this sound. It starts to vibrate high at low speeds. Even the reviewers like bikewale n all didn't write about it5) battery. There is a starting or starter problem with  new access 125, and when i went to see bike first, 3 people in front of me complaint of this issue. Even my friend bought n sold immediately because of starting issue and company says its due to battery. They provide exide battery which has good reputation. Exide has changed battery size and made it smaller. Not sitting its because of this or there is some issue with sep engine of suzuki 6) seat lock. My earlier model access used to lock the seat so smoothly, but the new lock needs a little extra pressure to lock7) torque pit sound. You can hear the vibration of torque pits even when engine is new. This is something that was there is earlier models too8) entire body except the front mudguard is made of plastic. This something that breaks first when u have a fall, can't be fixed or is costly unlike metal shields, and when u claim insurance u don't100% claim to plastic items. To save cost n reduced weight they have made bike of plastic 9) the company says it will not cover warranty if service not done in suzuki centers n all service coupon used. I had read a judgment from court of law that companies can't do this and had fined big time. Has this law changed? as i don't trust company service centres especially two wheeler ones. What could be improved. 1) reduce dial size and increase digital meter size2) add clock to show time3) front headlight flash switch 4) led parking lights and indicator lights. 5) map n gps navigation.",Access

665,Good bike daily commuters as i was using this bike for more than one year. It will get a mileage of about 35-40 kmpl. Very good for long journeys and for people who travel about 20-25 km daily like me. Looks also good in the newer version compared to old one. The only negative point is the engine sound and self start problem frequently.,Access
666,I owned my access 125 se on cheque payment from authorised distributor rock suzuki byculla.The riding experience is great and relaxed.In terms of looks and performance it has a retro look and superior performance as it has a 124 cc engine which is a great in today automatic scooter segment.The sitting is posture is very relaxing due to its 12 inch tyre in front which is a pros and cons is suzuki is claiming the average of 64kmpl is only on the testing track but the actual average is 40-45kmpl in the city streets.,Access
667,"Access 125 click among the masses is the fact that it had a higher displacement 125cc motor as opposed to the 110cc unit on its rivals. Other positives were  refinement, reliability and ease of maintenance being a product from the land of the rising sun.The suzuki access maintained its position as among the highest selling 125cc scooter in india but has faced stiff competition since the honda activa 125 made its debut which is also our pick as the best 125cc scooter on sale in india. The suzuki access was showing its age cosmetically and mechanically while new products also sported better features. Taking note of this situation, the japanese two-wheeler giant recently launched the new suzuki access 125.The new suzuki access 125 gets a semi-digital unit with a digital display for fuel gauge, odometer, service indicator and two trip meters. The seat can be unlocked conveniently through the ignition keyhole which is a good addition. Also the shutter key has a one push central lock system. There’s also a cubby hole next to the choke knob which is deep enough to hold a 1-litre water bottle. Mobile charger is an optional extra and is located next to the cubby hole unlike the under seat option as in rival scooters.",Access

672,"When i first bought access 125, is was this uplifting machine with so much power, the engine is very good and does not give any trouble if used properly. It is great for daily or occasional commute but not for any much longer terms as the seat could get uncomfortable at times. Even after years running it never gave any huge issues or needing regular maintenance. Service is not costly and is satisfiable. Try not to interfere with the scooter by adding any accessories without consent from the dealer or rto, as it could result in creating problems with the vehicle.Best thing is it would never gives you trouble and always fun to ride.",Access

The first problem arrived after 3 month's of buying was a bent in handle t bar, i thought it's a normal thing it can happen anytime cause of our country's roads, next thing i got to know about was a weird noise coming from gear box i went to service center these guy's told me it's a manufacturing fault we will fix it and will not charge me anything i was like clueless, thinking myself am i made a mistake buying suzuki product although they are a japanese brand, things went smooth for some time and another problem arises engine oil leakage. My scooty engine oil level started dropping down this time. Again the service guy's were very normal saying that it's a normal thing,   these engines usually face these kind of problems now and then i am really very sad after the suzuki experience. Very bad product. My thoughts are very clear with suzuki now will never ever suggest someone to buy suzuki 2 wheeler i doubt about there bike's coz now a days they are manufacturing big bikes like hayabusa in India don't know what they will do to it. Please some one from suzuki japan do the cross check what is happening in India. Don't spoil your brand image.

Now let’s come to the engine. This 125cc engine is from the predecessor but suzuki has made some major changes and the result is evident. The motor is now equipped with suzuki eco performance (sep) technology, something we also see in the lets and gixxer. This has made the access 125 more efficient and refined and it’s quite apparent. In fact, this scooter is the most refined in the segment. And not just that, there’s no vibrations at all, even at high speeds, which is super impressive. The performance too, with 8.5bhp and 10.2nm at your disposal, the access 125 performs really well. If you’re in the market for a 125cc scooter, you’ve two more options – the honda activa 125 which is two years old and is the most expensive in the present range or the mahindra gusto 125, which behaves like an 110cc scooter, plus, it hasn’t been launched in most of the indian states.

729,"Model: suzuki access 125, special edition, matte black, disc and cbs. The following review is based on our family ownership of five months of access 125 (4500 kms) and the tradition of owning scooters since their inception.The buying experience was very easy because we bought it unfinanced, the fall guard accessories came with the package itself and the staff was very supportive. Therefore, before jumping right into the pros and cons of the access 125 let me tell you how it feels to ride it. As you sling forward your legs around the foot board and rest yourself on its tan coloured, plush and wide faux leather (extremely good quality) seat, you feel the good build and finish right away, you get an inkling that the time duration of your commute is going to be pleasant and effortless. This is how i would like to describe this scooter, it is pleasant and effortless.Let us begin with its looks/styling: we have the scooter in matte black colour, the colour and the plastics seem of good quality. It has a quite neutral look; the matte colour makes it look modern, at the same time the chrome bezel around the headlamp and wide trapezoidal rear-view mirrors (also chrome) give it a retro-ish look. Neutral being the keyword, it is not different when looking from the front or the back, but the side profile is where it shines, the curves and the silver badging are tell-tale signs of its good looks. It is not an all-out retro scooter like the tvs jupiter classic but not a sporty one too like the tvs ntorq; the looks are as neutral, something like a honda activa but it definitely comes with a character. So it is indeed for everybody, the students, the parents, the elders; access 125 se is a great example of spot-on styling which is neutral yet attractive.Performance & fuel efficiency: linear and purposeful; the engine is smooth, it is teflon smooth, i used to be a honda fan and used to sing about its refinement and quality but this 125cc plant has got me good. It manages to generate 8.7 ps of power at 7000 rpm with a decent 10.2 n-m of torque. The low and the mid-range are excellent; which is enough to zip around the city for running errands and commutes. The initial torque is great for quick move-ons i.E. 0-40 kmh, it eagerly lunges into motion with a little twist of the throttle. The mid-range is rather linear because it takes its time to accelerate to the speeds of 60-70 kmh, which is not as laggy but is certainly not as quick as the low range. It means that overtakes are possible but with some care. The access 125 se is definitely not a highway runner because it does not provide the rider with enough confidence at higher speeds, the top speed can be easily stretched till an indicated 100 kmh but it is not its home turf, highways have never been a natural habitat for scooters anyways. Vibrations however are excellently well contained throughout the power band which is a huge plus. Overall, the performance of the access 125 se is more than adequate; a nimble low end, linear mid-range and an alright high-end. The 125cc engine is a fuel sipper; suzuki claims 64 km/l but one can easily expect 50 km/l with careful usage and 45 km/l with mixed usage in the street as well as on highways. The 5.6 litre fuel tank provides a decent range for long runs.  Handling, breaking and, ride quality: the access 125 is an absolute gem at handling, its 102 kg weight makes it a very light handler at extremely slow speeds; and at medium-high speeds too it is effortlessly manoeuvrable. Taking tight turns or u-turns have never been a problem due to its short turning radius. Breaking too is confident on the access 125, with 120mm disc at the front and 120mm drum at the back with cbs that provides excellent stopping power and safety. However, the 12 inch front and 10 inch rear tubeless tyres have an acceptable amount of grip but such good brakes could use a pair of grippier tyres because the rear tyre tends to lock up at times. Ride quality is an area which i can claim to be the best in class; the telescopic front and the rear swing arm effortlessly soak up bumps and potholes that are littered across our indian roads, as if the rider’s body never has to lose contact with the seat. The 160mm ground clearance is deceivingly tall that does not let the lower body scrape on speed bumps even when it’s loaded with a substantial amount of weight.Features and ergonomics: the access 125 se is not particularly a feature rich scooter, the headlamp, tail light, and indicators are all halogens and not leds. Despite the lack of leds, throw from the headlamp is very good. It comes with aho that eliminates the light on/off switch and the addition of a kill switch would have been appreciated. The horn too is adequately loud without being annoying; the scooter gets a 12v dc port for mobile charging with a pocket located in the front dash. It does not have an external fuel lid but accessing the under seat lid is easy because it can be twist opened from the main keyhole. The trapezoidal chrome rear view mirrors are extremely useful because of their width; a full panoramic view of the road behind you is available at just a glance. There is no side stand indicator or an under seat storage light, however, the storage space of 21.8 l is at par with the competition with similar shape but the seat hinge at the front does not feel as sturdy as it should have. The instrument cluster houses an analogue speedometer and a small digital display with read outs such as odometer, trip a and b, oil change indicator and a fuel meter. Ergonomics is also an area where this scooter shines, the seat at 780mm is neither low nor high, and the rider sits upright on a plush wide seat with hands on slightly high set handlebars, even the tallest person will not have their knees knocking the handlebars.Cons/ slight inconveniences:1.The engine exhaust note is not very pleasing; the engine even when not stressed makes quite a deal of noise and that is also the reason which makes a rider uncomfortable at higher speeds.2.	The rear wheel tends to lock up at times when only the rear brake is applied; it should not because it has cbs that should avoid locking up to an extent.3.	The matte black paint gets dirty very easily because of its rough surface, needs frequent cleaining.4.	The under seat hinge feels very flimsy. Foot pegs for the pillion rider are very short. 5.	The headlamps could have been all leds; drls are missing.6.	The digital instrument cluster could be way better and larger with bigger font.Conclusion: the suzuki access 125 se is as i said is effortless to use, it is great for running errands and for relaxing evening rides with your significant other. It is versatile, reliable, powerful, and again, effortless to use. It is one scooter that does everything and looks good while doing that. If you feel bored from your old honda activa and are looking for a classy upgrade, this is it, certainly it does not have the edgy looks of honda grazia or the performance and features of tvs ntorq but this scooter nails the basics so good that it fares better than its rivals; because features can get old, looks may not remain that edgy after some years but the class will remain, the refined, fuel efficient engine will remain, the great ride quality will remain.",Access

735,"When it comes to the scooter market in India, almost all scooters have calmly settled at the 110cc, 8bhp mark. It's as if they thought Indians really din't need a more powerful scooter.

You won't spend more than 1k per service for sure until you've met with an accident!! well you can go for the bike if your a city user and that city shouldn't have much of pot holes for sure.

The 2010 model suzuki access-125 type of footrest is the best i have seen in any scooter or two-wheeler. So, if the company can restore/fix that footrest on all the new model scooters of the company, it will be a great value addition. If that is done it would be an unbeatable scooter with all the user friendly features.2.Similarly, a centre-stand as easy as that of a jupiter would be a great value addition too. 3.And again, a helmet clamp with lock away facility would be great too.4.The rear view mirrors of jupiter and lets are quite fantastic too.

It's shocker has issue and you'll have to invest on it regularly.,Access
18,#3. Reliability: It's not reliable because of less mileage and comfort but also because the battery or may be auto start many time fails and if you have a bad knee then you have to use the kick. This makes it irreliable.,Access

174,"====DAY 10(June 28, 2008-100kms): I am facing serious battery problems with Access, with in just 10 Days of purchase. Its very disappointing.. Button Start is dead.. And to do a kick start is a himalayan task...coz u can kick start the Access only after placing it on Main stand.. I dont think anyone can place that 109 kg giant on main stand that easily... :( .. Even if I do kick start, it doesnt get started easily.. it requires 3 to 5 kicks in the morning time !! Horn is really horrible. not even a dog will move after hearing that ! when u slow down for a hump or so and try to use the horn.. its sounds like a cat's voice coming from Lion's mouth... Is this the problem in all Access vehicles or in mine only ? I am not sure.. But when I think of the 50k which I have paid, to face all these... its so annoying! Mileage is around 45 before 1st service.. But what do I do with the mileage if my 2 wheeler doesnt start at all !! I am goin to the dealer, will let u guys know the rest soon...",Access
175,"====DAY 18(July 5, 2008 - 350 kms): I went to the service center and got my battery replaced in my Access. Now Button start is working fine. The engine goes off if I reduce my speed or just stop raising the accelerator :( .. Starting the Vehicle in the morning is not a easy deal till now !! It goes off again and again ! Lemme c if it gets fixed in the next service...",Access
176,"====DAY 30(July 18, 2007 - 500Kms): I face absolutely no problems with my access these days...All Well.. And I must say, it has the best pick up compared to any other bikes/scooters in market, the moment the signal goes green, my access takes me far ahead of all other vehicles stuck in the signal!! its really a wow thing suzuki guys have worked on ..Will go for first service this month End..",Access

Its rainy season in bangalore now, I started from my office around 6.30 pm, It was raining heavily, I was just 3 km away from home, My Access behaved very wierly, it became too slow though I gave full throttle and it finally stopped. I tried kick starting, tried with choke but all in vain. it got started but the scooter does not move at all ! I started dragging the 109 kgs giant in the heavy rain.. I realised how nice would be if I would have gota light weight scooter (scooty type). since my house is in hilly area, I was getting short of breath pulling it. I really felt very sorry for my new scooter, that this 2nd major problem has happened with in just <3 months of purchase... I finally managed to drag it till my home after a long struggle. This morning, my local mechanic told that the engine cud hav been filled with water or some spark plug problem. Its still in the same condition.. If you are driving your access in rain, then please be well prepared to face such situations as well. I am very disappointed when I realize the fact that my 4 yr old bajaj spirit, which is half the price of Suzuki Access has never given me this much trouble till date..second service will be sometime in this month... I dont know what problem , access wil give me next month ! God save me :(",Access
178,"=DAY 120 (Oct 16, 2008) My Access has done ~2500kms. Already 2 services done. One thing I have noticed is that, no matter how regularly you do the service or how much carefully you handle the vehicle.... this scooter will give you some or the other problem once in 15 days :( It was working fine for 1 or 2 weeks after the 2nd service... now the problem is, the engine goes off whenever u slow down!! not just in the morning time!! it can happen anytime... I am waiting for my 3rd service date to visit the service center",Access
179,"=DAY 165 (Nov 29, 2008) 3400 kms. got the 3rd service done. no starting problem. one thing I strongly agree is that, Access never give problems soon after servicing. but servicing any scooter once in 2 months meticulously is not so easy. I m trying hard to increase the mileage !! I wish I reach 45 kmpl atleast (too greedy hah !!)",Access
180,"=DAY 84 (Sept 10, 2008) two days later, SUZUKI service person came to my home since I couldnt drag this vehicle for 10+ kms to the service station. He opened all the stuff and poured out 1 lt of water that got collected in the engine. He came with a new Air Filter. He told that most of the Access users face this problem in rain, so the company has sent new Air filter to rectify this problem. Though I couldnt understand the technicalities, I was clear of onething that - Suzuki uses Trial and Error method with its new Products :( .. After all that 2 hours of repairing and replacing the Spark plug.. Access finally started.. I am not that confident driving this scooter now, because I expect it to stop any time/place... Mileage has never been so great compared to Honda Activa. I drive @ 40 to 50 kmph (economy), I have never got anything more than 40 kmpl...whats promised by suzuki is 65 :) Atleast if I get 50, that will be ok.. thats the very reason y ppl choos access over activa I guess. hmm..Now that I have already brought this, cant help !!

But this drop I feel due to the heavy bumper to bumper traffic I am now facing daily in Bangalore. Shall update more on the mileage front once I hit next 1000Kms.. Mileage Update on 15th May 2009 :(truncated this part due to space constraint)",Access
307,"After explaining everything to my wife and after making her do a test drive we zeroed on Suzuki Access, now the vehicle is 25000 kms driven and used about for 3 years following are my observations",Access
308,"After free services got over, I made services in nearest local workshops, but it didn't affect my bikes condition. It now gives a mileage of about 47 kmpl as I checked it on Feb, 2016.(i.e 404 kms for 8.5 ltrs). I am extremely satisfied with my bike in all aspects.",Access
309,"After going thru all ur reviews, I finally decided to get this vechile... after a long wait its been deliverd to me on 06th aug. I finished 1100km so far. Just out of the first service....",Access
310,"After lot of thinking, browsing & talking with many owners I had zeroed on two brands Honda and Suzuki. Well by Honda name the obvious was Activa and Aviator and Suzuki it was Access 125. Since Activa by and large is not there from couple of years and the only thing that changes time to time as far as I have seen is the asthestics ie sticker etc.",Access
311,"After my lot of research, I bought Suzuki Access. I made a mistake. I should have gone for Aviator or Activa.",Access
312,After reading review on mouthshut we have booked one. It is having waiting period of 4 months in surat. To our surprise the vehicle is available freely in the market @ Rs 7000/- premium.,Access
313,"After reading through all the reviews on this thread and much of a dilemma between choosing Honda Activa and Suz Access, I went for a sparkling Blue access on Aug6.",Access
314,After riding the new Suzuki Access 125 for last 2 months I am impressed. Yes it's a stylish scooter that attract both men and ladies. I think this bike really suits for men than women because 125cc engine provide higher power and also the seat height is higher(780mm) when compared with another scooters which really effect ladies. The mileage of my scooter is 50 km/hr which is not really bad. Its really fun riding in the traffic and city because of its power(8.7ps @7000rpm). The seating position is really cool and is very comfortable especially someone having a good height. The breaks does not give the confidence to ride faster but still its having a good road grip. I met with few accidents so. the brakes really matters. Its also having a good storage space. The seat length is very good which makes it a perfect family scooter.,Access
315,"After sales service - The service center(M.D.Motors, Krishna Nagar, Delhi) is shoddy and dirty. However the vehicle servicing as such is OK.",Access
316,After sales service is the most important part of any automobile product and suzuki fails miserably in this field.,Access
317,"After say, using for six months the vehicle drags in the initial start up and the throttle also becomes sticky.",Access
318,"After so many months of anticipation, waiting and speculation I finally got the bike yesterday. Though I made the payment a week ago I got it at my hand yesterday only. An excellent piece of ENGG a well built body and excellent looks. I was comparing it with an ACTIVA I felt it looks like a GIANT in front of him. Mileage yet unknown but there is a bit of starting problem, I am trying to restrict the speed within 40 but at times in busy lanes if the speed goes 2 low the engine stops frequently. Don't know why? Is it some thing to do with the battery or NEW engine.",Access
319,After that I took it to its 1st service but the problems never vanished and thus I was forced to sell it.,Access
320,"After that main suffering started. Vehicle using continue started then then good but you switch off the engine then it will not gone start soon.i shown local machanic nearby cause you can not find authorised service centre every where.he some how check out and start the vehicle in hour or 2. Again vehicle running 2/3 days casually cause I don't travel daily or longer distance.but when I travel same issue occurred likewise.in 9th month I finally shown to 4 th service time to service centre and explain them every thing I'm suffering with they given me estimate of around 16'000+ GST INR saying that your vehicle ECM is Short costing 5900, Total body need to change costing 4500, oil leakage from engine head, engine moutain bush need to change, front break pad thread gone etc.",Access
321,"After the introduction of Zeus and the Heat motorcycles, Suzuki came out with a new scooter in the Indian market; Suzuki Access 125cc. The vehicle is braced with air-cooled and a four-stroke engine that has a CVT (Continuous Variable Transmission). The scooter features a typical Japanese design with the indicators studded on the apron. On the whole the vehicle has made attempts to draw similarities from Honda Activa in terms of ergonomics, styling and the design.",Access
322,After use of around 1 1/2 years I started facing problem of engine shut down while the scooters is running.,Access
323,After using a one year I want to share my opinion of this bike with you,Access
324,"After using my Kintetic Y2K for good 8 years it was time to move on. Not that it is bad in mileage used to get 40-50/liter still, but wanted a more powerful scooter. So being price, mileage and reliability conscious started to zero on a gear less vehicle (obvious that wanted even my wife to use the same).",Access
325,"After using the scooter for about seven months now, I must say that this is the best two wheeler after the Bajaj Wind 125 that I was using previously. The scooter handles much better than even many of the 100 – 125 CC motor cycles. Handling is superb even at speeds of 80 Kmph. I have ridden Activa which gets nervous after 50 Kmph. The pickup is too good and very useful in city as well as on the highways for overtaking. The suspension is a bit on the firmer side but that should be due to harder settings for better handling and road grip of the vehicle, and therefore is not a major issue. The mileage I get is between 46 to 48 KMPL which I feel is too good for a scooter. The seat is bit taller compared to most scooters and therefore is very comfortable for a six foot three inch person like me. The service center performs fairly well with the kind of volume they are handling. Many a times, I leave my car behind and take my scooter to office, just to feel the pleasure of riding it and I have to face a complaint from my wife that she never gets to ride it ;-)  Only problem I face is that compared to Honda which has three dealerships in different parts of Thiruvananthapuram and several authorized outlets, Suzuki has just one service center and no authorized outlets. Due to the increasing sales (mostly due to customer reference) appointment needs to be taken almost a week in advance, and due to the distance from my house, I have to take leave from my office for a day to give the vehicle for service (Honda service center is just a kilometer and a half away from my house where as Suzuki is around 8, and that too, I have to pass through one of the busiest areas in Thiruvananthapuram). Other than this, I am completely satisfied with the purchase and would definitely recommend the vehicle to all. Only request to Suzuki is to start more dealerships / service centers",Access
326,"After using this bike for an year, I started encountering too much trouble in terms of maintenance. The electric start hardly started working for me in the mornings, I started getting used to kick start. I am really mad, how they have designed and positioned the exhaust system for this bike. Its hard to use this bike during rainy season, as the placement position is very low for rain water to enter and create trouble.",Access
327,"After waiting for 3 months as we have one branch only in Mysore, I took delivery of my suzuki Access 125 scooter from the dealer.Right from the booking my experience with dealer was very positive.I got the colour I wanted[grey] and all documents except R.C book, expected from RTO in 3 months.]",Access
328,Again I went to showroom that mechanics said that sir may be battery problem so its not start but should be start by kick.,Access
329,"Again at 7 th paid service i told them about battery problem but they told me to replace the same by paying money. I have replaced my battery & found, my vehicle is not charging the battery. That means, there was a problem of vehicle which was not identified by shiv auto riders. They are interested in changing the oil only. They are not doing serving & making only money. Company has to take serious action such type of service stations & warn them to take care of customers.",Access
330,"Again back with my mileage update after 1600+ kms. I got a worst mileage some days back a pathetic 41Kms. I pondered and thought about the routes I need to take to office etc etc. Finally I decided to give a check of my Tyre pressure since I had checked it < 10 days back. You know to my surprise the front pressure was about 5 points more (normal is 18psi) and back by around 12 (normal is around 26-28 psi for single rider). All along I was having a little bounce but my thinking did not go on the culprit , Tyre pressure.",Access
331,"Again this rainy season water entered the gear box and noise comes from the gear box. The mechanics keep replacing bearings but the noise persists.I am spending money, but nothing happens.u can go with other honda activa.thank you.",Access
332,Airfilter is right above the rear tyre. And it sucks dust and water.,Access
333,"Airfilter is right above the rear tyre. And it sucks dust and water. realiability is also one of the major facilities not like good travels. its bike handling and controling is also not good because its not control in mud area, or in a village area this bike is not control and slept . its bike are not also good look and attractive.",Access
334,"All free service & paid service completed by authorized company service show room,",Access
335,All other scooters are limited to only a 100 or a 110 cc and think they dont require more.,Access
336,"All the switches such as Horn, starter, Light are easily accessible from handle",Access
337,All these problems which I faced I don't appeal that it is a best scooter.,Access
338,"All we are known the road conditions are not much good of cities and in such road conditions if you are travelling and suddenly you see the drain or hump the vehicle do not viable to its way and hold the grip of road even if you are late to apply for break. I have gone through these kinds of instants many times in Bangalore roads and its traffic but never taken away from bike, thanks a ton to my bike. I mean it is very comfort and safety vehicle.",Access
339,All we know that now a days all are living in the towns for the best and the better living of times so I forecely says that you have some of works in the towns for long and long times.So usage of the suzuki bike is very betterand the perfect solution for the life time efforts in your life if its avoided that is your badluck simply all can say that at the time when comes to mileage issue only it is the better way of giving super mileage performance at the same time comforts of the bike is super marvellous at the same time when comes to the reliability thebike is only thebest for ever and ever.grip of the bike is some what low when compares with others at the same time u can appeal at any time if any happens in your life time efforts,Access
340,All we know that the world is changing and every thing is changing,Access
341,Almost a difference of 20 KMPL exists when compared to the standard specification of the company. It is a major disappointing factor with this bike for those who expected a great efficiency.,Access
342,Almost all of these problems have a simple solution and I hope everybody gets to enjoy this vehicle just as much as I do:),Access
343,"Also 2500/- was an additional cost taken by the showroom guys for steel guard+ teflon coating, though the steel guard is required the teflon coating is tough to make out.",Access
344,Also for maintaining activa u need to soend extra than access,Access
345,Also if we go in high speed its speed getting slow automatically  it has many problem engine sound too loud and also have poor mileage vibrating and shuffling while driving it has several problems in rainy season like it slips many time on road while using brakes and if your thinking to buy then please change ur mind its a very maintainence scooter.,Access
346,Also milege is very bad on the long route it gives only 40 km per liter which is too less.,Access
347,Also some new colour schemes and suzuki made the 2017 access compliant with emission IV norms with headlamp always on feature.,Access
348,Also some other things. Suzuki access 125 is the best scooty.,Access
349,Also the average is good for few days but after that it also falls down so I would not recommend or suggest any one to buy this scooty.,Access
350,Also the seats are thin and hnce it is not comfortable. Handling is also poor. Cheap plastic parts are used and hence it is also not reliable.,Access
351,Also the shutter key has a one push central lock system. There’s also a cubby hole next to the choke knob which is deep enough to hold a 1-litre water bottle. Mobile charger is an optional extra and is located next to the cubby hole unlike the under seat option as in rival scooters.,Access
352,"Also the speed is nice and noise of running is not there fuel consumption is 50km/litre,it is comfortable to seat for 2 persons but 3 persons can reduce pickup speed and reduce the actual performance look is good I really like Metallic Gold color It is Technical, Economically Feasible, Handling and Controlling is too much easy and all the parts are too much confortably designed",Access
353,Also this scooter delivers great mileage of 55 kmph in the busy city rush even though it is a 125cc vehicle.,Access
354,Also we get regular service check calls from the company and people at the showroom are really helpful even after we have bought this scooter.,Access
355,"Also, I think scooter starts vibrating a bit on the front when front brakes are applied with force.",Access
356,"Also, engine is little stiff as vibrations are felt when reaching upto 50kmph.",Access
357,"Also, major design change came when Access gave it a retro look which many people loved.Overall very well built and good looking design.",Access
358,"Although I must mention it's a bit noisy. I personally feel that Activa is smoother then access 125 but considering all other factors, Access 125 would be the best deal.",Access
359,"Although one can argue that I ain't a smooth driver all times, I am not that wacky as well. So I am very upset on this aspect of the vehicle and I am going to sort other means to improve it, since the guys at the service center are not doing much for it. I great aspect I have noticed off late are the 'brakes' of the bike. Its simply great enough. Not entirely but you can compare it to that of a 'disk brakes system'. I simply love it, serves very handy for congested traffic.",Access
360,Although the comfort and handling was good but its not that good that I avoid all other major faults.,Access
361,"Although there is a room for change on couple of things. First is battery and second is pass light. Since it is BS4 the headlight is always in'ON' state. Sometimes it takes time to start the bike. About pass light the problem currently is, it has switch for upper and deeper, and you have to press and release the deeper multiple times for pass light effect. A button dedicated for pass light would be helpful.",Access
362,"Always complaints, perfomance is too bad, engine problem started within 9 months of purchase.spares quality are not at all good. mileage is very poor, only 30 - 35 kmp.ladies footage uncomfortable. its not usefull for ladies, starting problem even in summer.engine stops in between traffic. worst showrooms and costomer service.i purchased this scooter for my wife, but she drive only two times this scooter, she dont like this.please dont buy this scootter, no value for money",Access
363,Always going to service center but no use. Plz slove my problem. What to do with this vehicle. It stops while running.,Access
364,Am happy with this vehicle.its handling is also very smooth and good,Access
365,Am making up my mind between Access 125(though the way itz printed looks like Flccess) and Activa. But now am tilting towards Access and the reasons from my amateur perspective I shall give you:,Access
366,"Am really planning to dispose this bike and look for a motor bike for better mileage keeping in mind the ever increasing price of petrol.  Would request your kind feedback on which bike to go for now. ( am looking for good mileage, easy maintenance)",Access
367,Am satisfaide the scooter .comeny are provaided in 64milege but am chenq.to only 56 milege .but good pulling systam .,Access
368,Amazing bike it is. I like this bike so Much.the performance of this bike is impressive. This bike gives you super milege.,Access
369,Amazing experience to riding this scooter looks awesome.When I was buying this I am in trouble between activa and access but when I take a test drive my hole doubt are clear.It also have a comfortable leg space.And this bike have a awesome mate finishing.,Access
370,Amazing pickup and mileage and its petrol doesn't waste like others and,Access
371,Among these 3 scooters I have to choose so I have to check all the details of diesel scooter show one by one I will tell you about what are the facts which you have to think about buying a scooter because if you are buying a scooter it will be with you for at least 5 years so you have to think at least for 5 hours to make a better decision,Access
372,"And  standard variant in  crome mirror are look fantastic, guys this access 125 have top speed up tp 90km its my  personally experience.",Access
373,And I service every month after then this bike is too bad for me to I telling everybody this bike is compared to jupiter worst bike ever.,Access
374,And I was shocked to see a response from a service mAnasultanger “We haven’t touched it at all while servicing and we can do  anything to help you ”  He was insisting but all useless answers were provided instead of helping him.( I have his Bike Reg Number with me),Access
375,And I was shocked to see a response from a service mAnasultanger “We haven’t touched it at all while servicing and we can do anything to help you ” He was insisting but all useless answers were provided instead of helping him.( I have his Bike Reg Number with me),Access
376,And after using this scooter for around a year I have to get the piston changed I have many other scooters also none of their engine has been opened till now.,Access
377,And all the worked done in RIA Suzuki (authorized dealer of Suzuki Motors in Mulund) except one. I have copy of bill also if anybody wants to refer. So pls guy think twice before you go for it.,Access
378,And finally it was a pretty good for a 125cc scooter and also a good range for all especially for ladies to drive,Access
379,And for milage we can travel to any where without any pain when compared to other bikes we can balance and this bike capacity is good while driving I am not getting any back pain seat is so smooth and width of the seat is sufficient for every person I liked this bike I am happy with this,Access
380,And has engine type of 4 cycle single cylinder .and has a great road grip.,Access
381,"And have a great cmfort level , I am an employee , I do daily up down 35kms and its not feel so tough.",Access
382,And his speed is so much good  82 /km ph other than any scooter because its 125CC,Access
383,And if u were in cold areas then you have to face more problem regarding its starting .its engine gets off aftersome time if you does not accelerate it,Access
384,"And if you still wait, in April another 10% of the road tax in KA will be added up. For that I am pretty sure this vehicle will be very costly...",Access
385,And it gives a good mileage nd its speed is also awsum I personally have opened 105 top speed on this scooty with this scooty u can travel too long and u will not get any prblm in this scooty its maintainence is also very low    its handling is also good you can easily control this scoty,Access
386,And it has huge space for luggage so you can use this bike for heavy works nice comfortable.,Access
387,And it is easily damageable bike and it has not resold in the market again because of lite weight and sensitive model of the bike. So I will not suggest any to buy it,Access
388,"And its air filter asssembly very low quality.air filter damagic while driving.suzuki want to improove the accessory quality,and spare parts.its mileage is a middlege.and rear shock not comfortable. the shap of suzuki access like good. so dear suzuki coustommers please attention to these problems.",Access
389,And looks of the scooty is too stylish. and it looks very nice.,Access
390,And my dad unfortunately hurried up to buy this scooter as it was 5-10k cheaper Also,Access
391,And name access is in bold alphabets looking very good the 3D style,Access
392,And now a days new models are coming we can buy that by leaving this acess 125,Access
393,And now lets talk about the reviews of this scooter in terms of mileage it gives me to 50-55 kmpl,Access
394,And now the safety part. The Braking. Quite amazing. The vehicle did not skid but just came to a smooth halt.. Some of the things I do not like about the vehicle. The average. Just above 40 kmpl.The leg space.,Access
395,"And now your ordeal begins, spares are not available locally. Even dealers don't have the spares. In Hyderabad no dealer stocked the front mudguard.The dealer should place the order and the spares will be dispatched whenever the people at suzuki motorcycles are free from other things.  It will definitely take a month. Imagine the ordeal, if some thing nasty happens to your scooter. You will be left helpless and will be at the mercy of Suzuki motorcycles India. I went through all this. Even after 1 and half month my scooter is not repaired and it is lying at the workshop.",Access
396,"And service in Salem is also very good. This and Honda Activa are the best scooters available in the market today.. according to my experience, Activa is slightly heavier than this...",Access
397,And suzuki doesn't give out any of it major mechanical running components..its not available anywhere else than the showroom.,Access
398,And the body of access is of fiber so I accident happen hole body will break and te cost of body is high.,Access
399,And the cost of this bike is very less and reasonable cost compared to its features,Access
400,"And the last drawback which I found was its fiber plastic body is not a good fit for those who may frequently drive in a pot holed, patchy and rough roads, where huge pot holes as big as 7-9 inches in depth can appear all of a sudden right in the middle of the road.",Access
401,And the prize is also afordable by common people with all new facillities and the new model and sucessfull rating by people.,Access
402,And the worst part is the braking. There is no grip in the tyres . Very afraid to ride this scooters in highways .when apply breaks it always slipped. very very chance to have an accident.and I never trust its engine I never recomnd this scooter to any one,Access
403,"And then with same price its having more power and more milege and the main thing out of 10 scooties on the road, 9 activa and 1 access and I dont like being on boring side, as people gets bored of watching same thing on the road also I heard some problem with kick starting or activa in the morning, I dont know if its true or not but access oh man...i have HH CBZ Extreme, and I love my bike but today when I drove access oh man, its so smooth, so comfortable, I just loved it man. And the main thing its not just a ladies scooty, even guys like us would love to drive it. It's a unisex scooty made by Suzuki.",Access
404,"And there balanced & grip is awosem, you can easily balanced your bike in high speed like 60km/h.",Access
405,"And they never ever give warranty to battery, that’s why I will not recommend this scooty to anyone.",Access
406,And this difference I liked n I boought new access bike few weeks ago,Access
407,"And those who want to buy a bike , they can buy suzuki access125 , because it is an nice bike.",Access
408,"And to mention my bike tyre got completely eroded within 20, 000 kms mark. In general normal tyres last for atleast 30, 000 to 40, 000 kms. If  you ask them about it they say the same old story ""parts life depend on the driver of the bike"". My bikes clutch plates gone by 10th service. If you ask for the life-time of new parts they would say slokas like ""we cannot assure the life time of our parts, but our parts are 100% genuine. """,Access
409,"And todays all indian mopeds sell on highpric, activa's price is 60'000 with an accesery and this is not give a milage like access and suzuki give us a power full engine with good milage in a middle class person's budget.",Access
410,And very bad habbit of ignition becoz so many time bettert has been low if we not use bike even if we use than also while in riding it get stop engin that its doesn't start than have to start with kick,Access
411,And very bad habit of ignition problem.when battery is down.it doesnt start.you have to kick again and again,Access
412,"And very good suspension Front telescopic, coil spring, oil damped",Access
413,And we can drive freely Road grip big weels milage is super condition long Seat in bike we can seat comfortable its a very goid bike in other bikes now we all are taking that bike only so its a very good condition bike and we can go 2 long drive with comfortable in long we can seat 3 / 4 person in long also,Access
414,And when it comes to Comfortability its best compared to other Vehicals the seat is wide enough to sit for two persons.And wide leg space where we can carry a 20 lts of an water Bottle.,Access
415,"And yes they also give the first 8 servicings free, at least at the Bhopal service centre.",Access
416,"Another great thing about this moped is the comfortable and big seat for the best level of comfort even for long drives.it also has a small pocket near the leg space to put small stuff and 2 hanger clips by your legs, which honestly is great when you have more stuff to carry.",Access
417,Another guy told me one day That is the best looking Access 125 I have ever seen.,Access
418,Another helpful feature is that the dickey opening and the engine ignition are operated from the same slot. So its counter clockwise to open the dickey and clockwise to start the scooter.,Access
419,"Another important factor is that I never had to take my scooter to a mechanic for any engine problems.Periodic service maintains the condition of the engine.Once I had to change the battery and that's all.Model of the scooter is pretty much good.Aluminum covered silencer is great.About the road grip, the tyres used is very efficient and I changed back tyres 2 times in 4 years and the front tyre remains the same.",Access
420,Another incident happen while I given my moped for change the rear axle . After changing this when I go to pickup my moped . I seen scratches on my vehicle. I asked for the same to the manager( Mr Mithilesh) initially he not agree but after he seen CCTV Footage then he was agree this happen from there employees & he will give me change of this part after 8 days . After 8 days he was on leave & later on he left the organizatizon . And still I not getting solution on this issue.,Access
421,Another issue is that Airport Suzuki is not that much organized hence you do not get a proper and immediate response. I have requested it's general manager to take some proactive steps and will have wait and see.,Access
422,Another loophole is its less comfort provided due to cranky body seat design which is not upto the standard of a suzuki two wheeler.Its body style is not at all aerodynamic.,Access
423,"Another thing that I din't mention earlier was that since the body is not metal, you get only 50% insurance cover unlike Activa's which has a full insurance cover because of it's metalic body.",Access
424,"Another thing that I read after having run the scooter for 1900 km, you need to take the bike through all sorts of rides before 1600 km to have it run in properly. this means that you can and should throttle her up and down and not just ride at minimum throttle( I was afraid to go above 40 for first 1000 km)",Access
425,"Any body having any clue regarding problems experinced by me, please do revert so that I can be better equipped when my scooter is due for first service.",Access
426,"Any vehicle, whether it’s a Mercedes, or Ferrari or a truck WILL break down if you ride the clutch or the brake.",Access
427,Anybody would be able to answer my two questions posted on 17/03? I just wanted to know if I am doing that alone or some one is with me.,Access
428,Apart from all this I personally feel that this moped can handel all the rough roads and potholes on the indian streets with still giving a smooth ride and very less jerks to the user.,Access
429,"Apart from its functionality if we see the bike has a classy look and perfectly selected accessories. Like ( mirrors, the body figured and the seat) and it has a plus ponit that haveing a metal body.",Access
430,"Apart from mileage, I would have loved to have improved sit . While driving i somehow feel the sit is not that comfortable for a driver (I would give 8/10 points in terms of comfort). But probably, this is just my view point and others may not agree .",Access
431,Apart from that everything is great about the bike and the highlight is Mileage and Road Grip.,Access
432,"Apart from this(Rs51, 080) I had to pay Rs150 as commission to the salesman.",Access
433,"Appeal - As it has high maintainence and old featurea present in it , it looks like an old fashioned and outdated scooty on the road . Looks ugly too in compare with other bikes of this range .",Access
434,Appeal - I love my old model than this new one. Perfect moto scooter.,Access
435,Appeal of this bike has a nice beautiful looks and very well finished fiber body with attractive colours.,Access

445,"Approached Aryan Suzuki to help make the suspension better, they said that its the maximum limit .Just bought this bike from aryan Suzuki about a month back . If you have kids sitting in front, There is no space to put your foot after school bags are kept. The back stand is so flimsy .I went over a bump and the indicator buzzer went bust . The suspension works only when 2 to 3 people are sitting on the bike. Not suitable for single riding especially if you are above 40 yrs of age. There is no extended carrier at the back like a scooty if your child is sitting with a bag it hangs down putting pressure on their backs especially if bags are heavy. I have been using scooty and activa, never had issues like this. Access needs to be made more family friendly .The end of the footboard needs to be wider to accommodate kids bags and both kids legs and rider.",Access

The comfort with access 125 is so satisfactory, you can go on a limited long ride without any back pain problem as the seating of the scooter is very much awesome designed. This scooter can be greatly controlled even with a high speed of 60-70 km/hr but above that it is said to be not that much controlled. Looks wise I would rate suzuki access 125 as 5 out of 5. It looks so Awesome. For long life running performance of vehicle I would suggest that it should be make sure  on the road in a week for small trip atleast. Servicing to the scooter must be done, as indicted per every some specific kms without fail.",Access

452,"As I have mentioned in the title, I consider access as a scooter with the characteristics of pulsar. Traditionally we used to drive the 100 cc bikes.

It is a refined engine and holds its own even on steady 90kmph cruise which it was not designed to do, let’s be honest. Economy’s great as well. We got 48.1kmpl on our city cycle and 58.5kmpl on the highway which rounds out to 50.7kmpl overall.Ride and handling",Access

It’s the first time the company has used a 12-inch wheel up front and if you thought the previous Access was flawless, which it pretty much was, this one’s an even smoother customer. The suspension doesn’t throw you off when you hit sharp bumps and is much more pliant and comfortable than the current competition. Wheelbase has increased by 15mm and this coupled with the 12-incher up front make for a very stable ride on the highway, while a good chassis and turning radius maintaining an agile nature that you would want in the city",Access

Access 125 launched a new version recently which I think is not as hit as the last one. The performance is same as the last one but the looks which is the most important thing totally disappoints viewers compared to other versions. In this price there are plenty of diffrent better availaible options to go for. So as per my opinion the first thing that attracts a personare looks which are not that great.,Access

This scooter is not going to win any award in terms of its looks and this is not a sporty looking either but it features good looks although and it's a perfect family scooter. This is impressively quick scooter and the performance is great by the standards of its class and the mileage is also reasonable. The handling is good and the ride quality is great in this scooter.

512,Basically while riding in a city it gives around 40-45 Kmpl but while on highway it can touch the 50kmpl mark.,Access
513,Battery is placed under the foot rest. thus dirt and water easily goes upto battery particularly in rainy days thus making the battery wire to corrode easily. underseat storage and refueling requires to rotate the ignition key in anticlock direction. this appears to be a good thing but actually it makes things worse. repeated use of ignition hole make the connections of ignition loose and then you have to push the key clockwise harder and harder to start the scooter. After sometimes this stops working and then whole ignition assembly has to be reworked.,Access

So as per they told I do extra service to solve this problem but I couldn't not get sufficient solution of this problem.

The Suzuki Access is a 125cc scooter which I feel is best in class.Positives: 1. The pickup on this scooter is very good. Easy to climb up slopes.2. The throttle is very responsive. It's not required to rev a lot to reached economy speeds.3. Headlights are pretty decent for city traffic.4. A loud horn allowing you to warn traffic of your presence.5. Light handle giving you more control over the vehicle.6. Extra long seat gives you and a pillion rider ample amount of space to sit.Negatives: 1. The suspension makes noises when you go over bumps.2. No switch to toggle the headlights on and/or off.3. Fuel indicator has been observed to show wrong information at some points. Example: I had more than half tank of petrol and it warned me of low fuel.4. Shorter riders may find it a little less accesible. 5. Turning radius isn't upto the mark",Access

528,"Best part is, it is very light weighted and also looks good. It is also good mileage is around 40-45 KMPL.

Self balancing is also missing in this bike",Access

562,Break - This is not really good in Suzuki access. This troubles even at 40 KMPH. You have to apply both the brakes still it won't be under the control. It little skids and you have to balance a lot to stop it. Not sure if this is bug but servicing people said they are fine.,Access

566,But As it have 125 CC Engine but it doesnot have that much power as compare to Honda Active. For First Fews It is better but after some days it starts making problem .,Access
567,But I am still disappointing because of very poor quality of material utilizing in to the scooter for example when my scooter fall down on the stand so all accessory and head light are broken down and after purchasing this scooter I have to repair the wiring of light around three times in six months.,Access
568,But I asked in manual it's showing 63km per letter after one month 1 services I asked service enginear but what he's telling no this bike gives only 35km per letter.,Access

573,"But being a 125cc engine, it almost never feels strained even while sitting at its top whack of around 90kmph for extended periods. The CVT unit is new and clearly, emphasis has been given to bottom-end performance for ease of use in traffic. The ride quality is stiff and again, surprising as the older model managed this aspect rather well. The front telescopic suspension has good low-speed damping qualities where small undulations on the road aren't felt but jerks on the handlebar go up progressively as speeds increase.",Access

577,"But if you compromise in this , suzuki Acess 125c is a good scooter.",Access
578,But if your looking for performance than better buy Access125 don't even think of buying any other crap scooties that have just good looks. I assume Access have only one rival that is Activa. I can only advice to suzuki that its braking needs to be improve on Access125 as this vehicle is beast of all scooters at this range!:-),Access
579,"But it have also very high pickup in scooter range comfort is just amazing, so it is very reliable while driving it have no vibrations and sound in high pickup it may sound.",Access
580,"But it was a brain driven decision, not a heart driven one, hence it took some time to convince the heart. I was very happy with Trigger's performance, there were surely some issues, but the pleasure a bike gives you, nothing can replace it. I test drove Suzuki Access 2016 around March and immediately knew that it was a contender, but with the anticipations of PCX, Zir, SR150 made me wait, wait for something that will be a perfect marriage between practicality of a scooter and performance of a motorcycle. So, the wait eventually ended when Aprilia launched the SR150, and that too at mouthwatering price. I went ahead booked one on paytm, without even seeing it in person! Long story short, when the demo vehicles came down to the showrooms, I test drove it and found the SR150 to be short on space, all around, the seat and under seat storage and finally leg room. The other issue I had with SR150 was the stiff suspension, I know its race set, but for my usage it was not suitable. So had to say goodbye to my booking amount on paytm and forget about the SR150, hard decision, but had no choice. With no announcements from Honda about PCX150 and Hero about Zir, it was all new Suzuki Access 125 then!",Access
581,"But its major problem is its road grip, the road grip of this two wheeler is not good which will lead to many bad things happen on the road. The causes of poor road grip is, the poor quality of wheels. Due to poor quality of wheels this rider is not able to have a good road grip.",Access
582,But mileage is just normal in city test conditions. Mobile charges proves a good advantage. Its well suited  for our tough roads. Well its good to ride it. It is slightly overprices I feel. Could be better if prices.,Access
583,"But more then this, what I have felt most is that they give warranty of 2 years but in that there is condition to get all services done by them and oils to be changed by them only as and when they say. Normally they dont follow prescribed schedule of service book and ask customers that it has to be changed.",Access
584,But my bike geving only 25 to 30 again he done some tuning he told me sir ur bike geving 32km he told me sir u shoud do 3 service after this well give after 3rd service also its giving 25 to 30 only .don't by anyone this bike,Access
585,"But none has a solution to it. I repent buying Access, total waste of money.",Access
586,But now the updated suzuki access 125 is build with all new design and its crome headlamps look cool also the suzuki now produced all new engine and it states that its a SEP i.e Suzuki Eco Performance which increases milage along its power.,Access
587,But only negative aspect is about the brakes even if you apply both the brakes it will take at least 2 to 5 seconds to stop. Which may create problem at times.,Access
588,But overall a good scooter and probably the best in the market as of now.,Access
589,But the only problem is it stops suddenly while driving( even if there is enough fuel) .,Access
590,But the other Scooter like activa has digital display. The mileage of access is more better than the active. The seat is bigger than the another scooters. I like the design of the access. I stay in Hyderabad the Suzuki service center not available as mush as honda hero. I prefer u to set back brake as disk brake. The sound from the scooter is much more than the another scooters. I would u to buy access it is much more comfortable than another one,Access
591,"But then this is no surprise as the engine is a 125 cc as compared to 102 of Activa prima facie, which may though be compensated by higher weight of Access 109 Kgs as compared to 104 Kgs of Activa. Riding position was much more ergonomical and comfortable then Activa but purely from my physical characteristic point of view and hence may differ from individual to individual. Braking was spot on and didn’t have any spongy feeling like Activa. Front forks are pretty smooth and may better Activa in typical Indian condition which has potholes and craters. I managed to drive it intentionally at low speeds through potholes and it was pretty impressive as it didn’t bottom out as was the case with Activa.",Access
592,"But they are not interested in solving the problem . So for the first year it was great without any problem , but from 2nd year onwards it started giving problem of Low mileage ( Even on Highways) , accelerator problems , engine noise & worst was start-up problems in bright sunny days(Forget the winter even in Mumbai climate) . every time the service center ( MRP-Dombivali Mumbai )  took additional charges ( as its out of warranty ) & informed that we have set the things now ..it will work fine . But the problem resurfaces after 8-10 days .",Access
593,But today I faced problem in my scooter is eat the oil (oil khay 6) & my scooter 37000k. I am runned. Completed,Access
594,"But we need to make an important statement that all of the comparison scooters had made entry into the market at the right time.The all new Suzuki Access 125 REALLY is brand new, almost every bit from chassis to design and engine to improved torque. Suzuki has always brought noticeable difference in every new launch. They surely have understood the like minds of Indian customers. Taking this as an advantage their very new product Access 125 has given the right product by appearance.",Access
595,"But what is really nifty is the fact that the scooter now comes with a couple of handy features like the ignition slot doubling up as a boot release, a useful front pocket, and even a mobile charging socket available as an add-on. Switchgear and fit and finish levels are good and on par with the rest in the business.",Access
596,But when you have about 70km/hr which it easily does it is a smooth sailing,Access

622,"Comfort level is as usual in all mopeds.But suzuki could have manufactured it more compatible, more reliable.",Access
623,Comfort of the bike I found very low. Because I was getting tired in the sitting while driving the bike. Also here it might can be reason that Roadgrip of the bike is average but the stability of the bike is very low so you loose your comfort.

635,"Comfortable, although the seat is a bit high. I'm 5'8"" and there are times occassionally when I've struggled just a little bit to station both my feet on the ground.

638,"Coming to the bike, it is very good looking and has very less fuel consumption comparing to other scooties I have used previously.This bike has good comfort and reliability is very good.The difference I found in this bike is the effect of handling this scooty is very easy in handling and most importantly the looks of this scooty is mind blowing. have purchased it in last march stilli don't have any kind of negative impression on it.",Access
639,"Coming to the drawbacks, one of the major ones were its lesser road grip due to its design or whatever kind of dynamics, because when I give a little more acceleration in roads/patches which had light slush or garbage littered the rear wheels just turn like crazy but the vehicle is just in the same place, lesser break power, bcoz at some point of time I was forced to brake down suddenly at high speeds in some places in Hosur road due to careless bus drivers, there I found the scooter backside skids sideways till the rear brake lever is released slowly.",Access
640,"Coming to the mileage, the company says it will gives around 60kmpl but in reality it",Access
641,Coming to the pickup as u know the access stands for a great pickup its pickup is awsome than you think.You will feel flying on it.,Access
642,Coming to the point of pick up & acceleration well our bunny is 125cc & it surely lives upto this & gets ahead of activa.More power & guys wont feel awkward as thin is heavy & verty sturdy.,Access
643,"Coming to the ride and handling, the Access felt more stable than most other scooters owing primarily to the slightly higher weight and the longer wheelbase. The front end was well weighted and aided by the telescopic suspension, handling was very stable and confidence-inspiring. It wasn't exactly plush but on state roads it felt comfortable. Many people claim that the pickup is bad. When I rode it, I realized that the gearing is different than Honda scooters so while it doesn't take off from a standstill, the midrange and top end is really strong. I rode the Access extensively in Goa for thee days and I could happily cruise at 70 all day. If pushed, it could touch a top speed of 90+ which was excellent and the Access felt stable at those speeds. Brakes were good too, though emergency braking would still need quite a lot of effort and would unsettle the bike. There was sufficient power available at all speeds, quite unlike the 110cc scooters which felt like underpowered after 60kph. The engine was a bit more rough compared to Hondas and the exhaust note was a bit brash. I can say this as the bike which I rented was a relatively new bike with only 6000kms on the odo.",Access

So as far I'm concerned this bike is really good in its own way the style isn't a copy of other company's scooter but its unique. I have rode so many versions of access over the years and I can tell that access surely is one of the most powerful scooter in india. Its pickup is amazing no scooter couldn't can reach that level though being a gear less bike access has proven it's strength. Those who bought this bike I told them one thing that don't bother about it's look, look wise it may be little dull but its milage and pickup has no comparison. The new access has a variety of colours like blue white etc. Just like the old bike suzuki has kept their promise for this bike the speed of 2017's is the same of 2010's no doubt about it. Just like all other scooter it has all the facilities you needed, carriage, milage and good road suspension. 40-50 is the milage though suzuki promises 60-70 but the reality is 50's max. I highly go for this bike.try it you wont regret it. For looks I'm giving three stars as its not that attractive as other gear less bikes really are but manageable, for comforts I will give four stars it is comfortable for sure, handling and controls I will give suzuki access 150 three stars it's a good rating though, fuel consumption no doubt four stars because suzuki access 150 is one of the few bikes in india which is fuel efficient.

800,"First of all, I want tell you all that I am not sales promoter or from agency of Suzuki access. I am a general public customer. If you are really confused which scooter to buy after reading various reviews in different websites. My advice is choose only one scooter that is new access 125. Yes. It is having great pickup and one will definitely feel riding a car and not driving a scooter. I am access 125 customer for the past 8 years. Person who accustomed to ride with access, will never like any other brand of scooters in India which won't give this much of comfort. It will never skid, never cause back pain, 3 persons can sit comfortably even for long drive. Don't be particular about mileage and resale value of the vehicle. In other scooters, you will fell down on road while skidding, and with backpain you will loose your money for treatment as well as your peace of mind. Considering this, why dont you be particular only on comfort, road grip, pickup which access will give you. It may be giving 40 Kmpl mileage. But it is an excellent scooter with no starting trouble in self start like Honda activa 5G. My advice is only buy access 125 with your hard earned money which is really value for money. I enjoy riding my new access 125 for the past 3 months and didnt find any difficulties so far as I have been a proud customer of Suzuki access for the past 8 years. Pls trust my words and don't waste your money in buying other brand scooters. Take right decision.",Access

817,"For performance, ride quality and comfort this scooter is superb. In fact it is the best mileage giving scooter in 125 cc segment. I am getting between 46-50 in city drive. Now if we talk about finishing, looks and built quality then the finishing of this scooter is really good. Built quality is not as good as compared to honda activa but better than rest of the scooter in this segment. Now on co ming to the features and styling, it missed some of the main features like engine switch and petrol lid open switch( these should be there in this price range which other scooter in this segment have). Look and design is totally subjective, one may like it very much, others may not. But in my review I like its front profile but rear and side is don't like it at all. I love retro design but the look and design of this scooter is not catchy like vespa in retro design segment. Overall I bought this scooter for overall ride quality and mileage.",Access

They were saying that the product is selling good even without an ad. Then I started consulting my friends & read several forums including MouthShut_Official to see which one would suit more for a beginner like me.Also I had to ascend 2-3 inclines before reaching home. So I thought it would be better idea to buy a scooter with more power. So I finally booked the access on sept 3rd'09 from kaimanam suzuki, trivandrum.",Access
827,"Fourthly, there approach towards providing details of required documents for booking of vehicle.- I had asked to provide the necessary document details and they took 5 days to provide me the details and format of the affidavit required during final settlement.

828,"Friends personally I have seen some critical talks from the few garage people, even I asked them some question about what I wad planning to buy for my sister Suzuki Access 125 - 2010 model was so worst according to them. The garage mechanic told me that 2010 model was not in success platform even the made was so worst. the machines which gaves always trouble and need service every some time so what is the need of it. they stop me to buy it from old seller and more thing mechanic told me about it that it needs original parts to work, it means some time if we dont find any original parts so we cant repair until we get it.",Access

I told this prob to suzuki service center guys at every servicing. bt still mileage prob. is not solved. Many people claimed that they get 45-50 kmpl. I tried Indian Oil, HP, BP petrol bt every time the mileage is same. Service my bike every 2 months. What's the problem?",Access
831,From looking point of view its good and balancing of bike is also better. Its weight help you to run the bike at high speed with proper balancing. Since 2012 no major maintanance required. after every 1500 km run I go for servicng(only oil change),Access
832,From past years we know that Access 125 is a popular and widely used Transporter in India so I am sharing my reviews regarding Access 125 even though scooters in Activa provide the equal mileage and space as in Access 125 even at an affordable price the scooter provides a front disc brake which locks up the wheel whenever we apply the break so please review your opinions,Access
833,"From recent reviews, it looks like delivery time is getting reduced for Access. Also after that Activa was also available for immediate delivery.",Access
834,"From the 1st month, scooter's engine is not working properly.",Access
835,From the 3 months I had the Expence of the bike is 6200 and this expence is morre on new moped which is been recentle removed from the Company and Moped are getting brake.Access 125 the body is fully Plastic that whenever toches your moped some of the things will brake which is damn sure and the main part is the average of the moped is to low mainly my moped gives the 20 to 25 of average.,Access
836,From the date of bought and now I changed its body 6 times ??.,Access
837,"Front mud guard also give up quite early in life and it keeps rattling and broke very easily(does't matter how carefully you keep it). On approaching service center, prices for small parts are also kept very high and also insists on getting fixed on their service center.",Access
838,"Front shockers are telescopic and are supposed to take path holes with ease but it doesn't. every small thing under the front tyre is felt on handle bars. Adding to problem, the outer coating or paint of telescopic shockers starts peeling off and it looks really ugly.",Access
839,"Front shockers make ""crank"" sound in pits, I requested while first service of the scooter, but they could not help much.",Access
840,"Front suspension is good, rear suspension makes u jump if u ride without pillion rider. Power is enough to overtake any scooter, even sometimes other 125CC bikes and 4-wheelers.",Access

848,Fuel consumption may look promising on papers but when you need a service after sometime for well working of the scooter the service al would be very bad. Very unsatisfactory.,Access
849,Fuel consumption(45/1)(kms/liter) good pick up its totally my budget.,Access
850,"Fuel consumption- As it comes with good powerful 125cc engine so don't expect that mileage will be good, I experienced it's mileage and comes to the conclusion that it's mileage is very poor, Company claims to have the mileage of above 40kmpl but it gives only 25-30kmpl.",Access
851,Fuel consumption: The average of this scooty is actually not very good may be one of the reason is it's engine power as it comes with 125cc engine so we can't expect more average from it but there are some scooties in the market which are giving an average of 40kmpl as compared to this scooty which is giving 25-30 kmpl.,Access
852,Fuel injection Technology provided by Suzuki Access so it is also good think gearbox call Sweety and engine bola is 52.5 yum yum Subah is also not so small this is my experience about my Suzuki Access 125 I hope it is good review for you or helpful for you if you want to buy this scooter I recommended for you.,Access

858,Gives good road grip and pick up is also awsome. Mileage is given as promised.,Access
859,"Gladly, Suzuki designers have taken stock of the situation and given the new Access 125 a fresh lease of life with respect to its appearance.

908,Handling &Comfort;- Designed the driving position gives comfort with confidence stability feel. Alighned the seating and handlebar is perfectly local or long drive. Inside of the city riding handling is excellent to say.,Access

But the little detail is that the Access 125 sits on a longer wheelbase – 1, 265mm, 15mm longer. This is perhaps why the Suzuki Access 125 feels stable and neutral rather than top heavy or too eager like scooters are wont to do.",Access

They just bill you and return the vehicle as such. good water wash and 3 M polish your service is done. 24K kms the engine has started giving problem enquired with several access customers every body is complaining about the worst service and engine problem after 18K kms.,Access
1022,"Hi all I have done 20, 500 km on my access 125 and would like to give a real feedback. About my driving, I ride my scooty in a very relaxed manner all the time. The first problem arrived after 3 month's of buying was a bent in handle T bar, I thought it's a normal thing it can happen anytime coz of our country's roads, next thing I got to know about was a weard noise coming from gear box I went to service centre these guy's told me it's a manufacturing fault we will fix it and will not charge me anything I was like clueless, thinking myself am I made a mistake buying Suzuki product although they are a Japanese brand, things went smooth for some time and another problem arises engine oil leakage. My scooty engine oil level started dropping down this time. Again the service guy's were very normal saying that it's a normal thing, these engines usually face these kind of problems now and then I am really very SAD after the Suzuki experience. Very bad product. My thoughts are very clear with Suzuki now will never ever suggest someone to buy Suzuki 2 wheeler I doubt about there Bike's coz now a days they are manufacturing big bikes like Hayabusa in India don't know what they will do to it. Please some one from Suzuki Japan do the cross check what is happening in India. Don't spoil your brand image. Suzuki is launching his new scooter Burgman Street with the same engine so people out there please make sure you invest your money wisely.",Access

It comes with drum break, as well as rear disc break and also with a special mat finish coating called special edition. In drum style there are several colors red, blue, white, black, grey & silver. Other alloy with disc break bikes has only white, grey & black colors. The major highlight was its suspension, the front base tyres are higher than the back base, so we can handle the moped easily without hand pain. The engine was so good and smooth even when we are reaching 80km/h in an highway road, there is no vibration are heavy sound. Coming to the milleage part, it gives 40km in traffics inside the city and 45-50 km in in a highway road.

BUT, performance is very bad, this scooter is lowest milage scooter in india, milage is worst, can't handle even 3 hours of continuous drive, my tyre burst in less than 3 hours. Engine damaged on drive way automatically. Total engine along with every part changed from service center but engine again got damage in less than a month. Parts are unnecessarily expensive as compared to other companies, parts not available anywhere else, other then company showroom and they charge too high. Scooter sound is also worst in comparison to others.

This scooter is the combination of activa and dio . It looks nice though some may argue , suits perfectly for the whole family like activa and still has lots of power like dio. So I say that if you want basic family scooter that can carry luggage and people and not power go for the activa and if you want thrill in riding then go for the dio and if you want both go for the access, you will not regret your decision.",Access

1387,I have a great mileage. I have better mileage that other scooties except activa. you would be knowing that activa have launched new HET series whose full form is Honda Eco Technology which has mileage of 60 kmpl and ou get somewhat mileae around 55 kmpl in suzuki access but I do not feel any difference between acccess and activa. there would be very minor difference in mileage of both scooties. but there is also a minus point in this scooty which that it good a full plastic body which is not good. disadvantage of plastic body that it breaks very easily. I am not saying it because others say like this. I am this because I have experienced it. once driving I met with with a accident but not severe one it was quite minor but then also area below headlight broke. and you would not believe that my that accident was with cycle. but that cycle was in great speed. so you should realize that this scooty have body which could be broken by a cycle which is in great speed. from past  three to four months engine of my scooty have started making very loud noise. overall I like this scooty. it is a great scooty.,Access

1397,I have been a suzuki customer in the past. I loved the old Accest. It was more comfortable and with better looks. This old access is poor in looks. It is more of a lady ride. I would recommend to go for Honda Activa. Activa has got better looks and wide body which looks great. I haven't seen any issues with activa. And the new activa has got more better looks of the headlight and a digital screen. Activas exhaust sound is better than Access. And even the servicing price of honda is less than Suzuki.

As it is 125cc engine the mileage is approximately 45-50km per Liter. It has a amazing grip while traveling for short or long distance. One thing I found is that, it really costs alot when you go for servicing of the scooter, or else I would say maintance of the scooter",Access
1413,I have been using Suzuki Access 125 from last 1 one year it is very very wonderful the design is very good even for the boys and the girls It has good leg space so person like me 6 Foot 3 inch tall can sit comfortably .

1417,I have been using new access for about nine months now. I have used other scooters also but access is the one I prefer from now firstly is the performance and smoothness is very good and just feels so pleasant to use the throttle.the mileage is slightly less than the other scooters but it is not a big deal.i have ridden my cousins Activa 125 and I should say that I cannot find the kind of smoothness and quicker acceleration like in access in it. I definitely recommend access for those who want a family commuter.it fits perfectly as a family scooter,Access

Reliability and comfort is great with pillion rider as well. Average is somewhere it lacks but it is acceptable after convincing ride quality. I need to suggest in one thing. If starter doesn't work, it is very hard to kick it as kick is placed near main stand. You have to pull whole moped on main stand and then you have to kick the scooter. For females, it is difficult to start with kick.",Access

I have two access the old and new model has powerful engine light weight and the front tyre is bigger than the rear one which makes a problem of sliping on turns. Thats all but its really worth the money. I still use suzuki access for long rides that means only trustworthy vehicles are used for lond rides and its trust qorthy.,Access

This also results in bad milage and goves only 35-40 kmpl milage. Tje opening of the fuel cap is alao a problem as it will not open at any cost at the time needed.

1618,"I purchased new Suzuki Access 125 in last month. Main thing I want to tell about Mileage, the mileage of the bike is very acceptable around it will give 45-50 km per liter in a Bangalore city. The look of the scooter is very beautiful anyone can attract that beauty. Then come to comfort of the scoter is very excellent because the scooter’s seat is very large and easily sit three persons.  Hence the scooter is very comfortable when compare to any other scooter available in the market. The power of the scooter is very excellent when compare to any other scooter. The engine is excellent. It is very attractive in looking. I am very glad to say that the new access 125 has now came to market with colour variants. In this new colours are maroon red, and blue very amazing colours. I purchased Red access 125 which is entirely different from old Suzuki access 125. Engine is very powerful. Ladies also can ride and balance easily. Because the pleasuring thing is that its kerb weight is now deadly reduced to 102kg which is normal weight for all genders.  Riding is very extra-ordinary and gives exciting feel. The new look which I most liked in this scooter is steel mirror with round shape. It further enhances the look of our scooty New Suzuki Access 125. The more important advantage of this scooter is its under seat space is widen than the old access 125. Due to this wide space we can easily keep our helmet and rest of the things easily. Another needed benefit introduced in New Suzuki Access 125 is mobile charging pin in the front and keeping half litre water bottle in the left side of  front. Thrilling riding and high pulling capacity and luggage spacing is really amazing which I never seen in any of the scooters. Its multi-purpose scooter we can say. Because its helpful for family riding, like 3-4 people can easily sit due to its large lengthy seat. Another thing is its stylish which can also be bought by the college students who prefers most stylish scooter. Fuel saver is its main feature. One mind blowing thing I wish to say is my scooter is now ran upto 300km, service is not taken yet as the service is given after purchasing by one month or 750km whichever is earlier.  I am very sure that without service only it gave upto 45km mileage so its 100% sure that after regular services no doubt it will give above 50km/litre. Excellent modification because I have discussed with many of my friends who are using old access 125 who were complenting that its not good at mileage wise, so don’t buy. But when I visited to showroom those salesmen were very sure about new access 125 mileage and they preferred us to buy and gave assurance about its mileage. Its sure. I suggest to all scooter buyers to buy new access 125 which will really serve your all purposes.",Access

1702,"I was looking for a allround package and selected Jupiter, New Access and SR150. after taking test ride of SR150, I striked out coz it was too tall for my wife. then we tried Jupiter, it clicked all the check-boxes, but I was looking for something beyond 110CC. a friend of mine recommended to NEW ACCESS 125. I took a test ride with my wife. the moment I raced it from the standstill, I got to know whats underneath. shear performance of 125. I zeroed on Access, then I had to just coerced my wife into getting this slicker zipper. Got everything in place and Blue Mermaid was delivered in the midst of thunders. Took a ride down the internal roads and found my decision was not wrong. Handling was very good compared to any other except the new entrant(SR125, SR 150, NTORQ). Its just breezes through. THe common problem I face with other 110CC's was that the pillion rider had to stretch his thighs on the outside due to fatter rear, but in access 125 this is not. it has got the slimmest rear, hence long pillion rides are not painful. suspensions are feather light. it easily absorbs bumps with two in tow. I found the front tyre was little smaller than the others but then the breezy overall handling negated this. the only thing which troubled me is the frequent visits to petrol pump. gave me an average of 30-35KMPL. My daily commute is 7km with 10-15km on weekends. maybe thats the reason it is not giving more. Digital console is just a gimmick, it looks like a 2 liner pager with fuel meter, tripmeter, oil change. No CLOCK. with a big speedometer.  instruments & controls quality is good. after a long year of ownership it still zips around as a new bie. TOUCHWOOD.",Access

2054,It was purchased in 2015..when I invested more for a long lasting vehicle. But I am totally disappointed. Friends without more waste of time I come to important flaws of this vehicle as per my experience and repair agencies advice about the vehicle..,Access
2055,It was the bike which good with a good speed and having good looking and also Good picup so it was nice and also its milize also as good as compare to others also so mostly girls and boys of youth will prefer this one and also price also will be good for the what we keeping it was nice one to bye,Access

A product that has the best basic features like design, engine, pick up, speed, economy, mileage and sturdiness. I loved this scooter from the day it entered my life. It makes life so interesting, and travelling a great experience. The first of it's kind in the 125cc segment, which responds so briskly and brilliantly to acceleration. It just glides like a bullet, cruising at very high speeds even in the difficult traffic conditions. All suzuki two wheelers have that unique technology wherein there's Nil friction or holding back by the engine during reduction in throttle. Its a dream vehicle. Suzuki are not giving enough advertising for such a brilliant product... I feel that the sales of Suzuki Access 125 does not reflect its brilliance!.. A product that deserves more.. It makes its owners more relaxed because it takes away the entire pressure off its owner... Just Happiness and Joy...",Access
2083,Its 125cc engine gives good pick up. Suspention is good. Comes with tubeless tyres. But the best part is the looks. The design is classy. Colors are rich.,Access
2084,"Its 125cc engine is really powerful. If you buy this bike with accessories its looks are going to enhance. If we talked about its pickup it just fabulous. Mileage is less as compared to Activa 5g. Road grip is also a strong factor of this bike. Its mat black colour is looking amazing. I fall in love with this one. If we talk about comfort, its a really good.",Access
2085,Its a competative world of scooter and suzuki is the brand when it comes to bike.,Access
2086,Its a first bike I bought in my life.It is wonderous with 125 cc engine which is very powerful compared to other scooters. Its top speed is 102 km/h which I own have rode on highway its comes with good average.I was able to get full comfort in my access but after 2-3 years its got rough and hard to sit. Its front mudguard is very weak after some time it makes sounds.In handling its very good and safe as isaid its has a very good pickup the man sitting behing can fall down if we raise too fast.But overall it is nice and its mileage is 40 km/lt wich is good.,Access

2096,Its been 9 years after am using the suzuki access 125. I bought this scooter neglecting the honda activa which was prime scooter in 2009. But the experience with this scooter was immense pleasure till today. 125 cc with 9 bhp is very good in scooters back in 2009 where 100 cc scooters ruling the roads. The pickup is very fast. Engine is smooth. Believe or not I hit 90 kmph in a scooter in my earlier rides. I even took 2 people and a gas cylinder which were almost 150 kg without a hazzle. It could run up the hill very smartly with the weight. The long seats is the best in its class. Road grip was very swtisfying with mrf tyres. Access 125 was the first 125 cc scooter introduced by the suzuki back in 2008. Maintainance was low. Riding comfort was very good. Mileage I used to het around 40 kmpl. For 125 cc its a good mileage figure. It had a great appeal. I bought it for 52k on road back in 2009. Now its around 80k I guess. If u cant afford vespa 125 or aprilia sr 150 you can opt to suzuki access 125 eyes closed. It gives all the good features which you want in a scooter. Its the best scooter experince I had for 8 years.,Access
2097,Its been a year since I am using this scooty. Earlier from that I had another scooty from other company but believe me it is very very helpful than that one.,Access
2098,"Its been over a year since I bought this scooter. It cant be claimed to be the best but its a really great vehicle at its price. The mileage of the vehicle is also not so bad, top speed is also really satisfying. I have no issues or complaints till date except for an issue regarding the breaks, but it got fixed and now the scooter is just fine and fit. The look and design is quite good and catchy. I bought the red varient and it suits me quite good. It has a mobile charging socket in it , like in the cars which is a really helpful feature.",Access
2099,"Its been the worst in case of following aspects. It's bad thing is that it dont provide good services to its owners. Even its own service center . they charges high and just no improvement in the vehicle performance. Its fuel consumption is high which is around 35 km/litre which is a way low as compared to other vehicles like Activa , jupiter and others. Look is just avrrage but its head light don't illuminate much. Overall I would say it's not good if we look at its price. Really not on the marks - Suzuki.",Access
2100,Its body structure also waste because if it touches any metal or something it sis breakable.And engine chasiss also 125 but it did not reaches maximum.It is not designed for the heavy mud trails.It has 6000rpm engine but not capable for heavy loads .This may affect more on a small family or small business persons,Access
2101,"Its broad seating arrangement ensures that rider doesn’t get tired on the long distance driving I drove this at a stretch of 100km and really the ride was enjoyable. Its 35 watt halogen bulb ensures that you have clear visibility in the night. Even at the high speed braking is good, vehicle come at smooth stop.",Access
2102,"Its comfort is very good, it is easy to handle, it is mostly useful specialy during traffic time we can put any big weights in this scutty frount, it can carry a heavy load handling and controlling is very easy, it seems to be a very good bike, this bike can be used for both men and women its light arrangement is very fantastic",Access
2103,Its complitily solid and strong .its assecerige is stylish and modern its mileage is 55-60 klm per litter petrol .,Access
2104,Its different from the same boring honda activa look. And has that extra pickup which makes the ride more enjoyable. The quality of plastic used is not great when compared to honda.,Access
2105,Its driving good but after some problem in my scooter its very bad experience for it. It has 125cc great power engine therefor its not getting more power than its similar scooter gave.,Access
2106,Its engine and gear box has good power on indian roads .it has the same engine higher capacity.,Access
2107,Its engine heat in a high amount.   Its look and design very poor.,Access
2108,Its engine is heavy so it feels good to drive this. Mileage is also good not the best bt still good. And its very comfortable for long route.,Access
2109,Its engine is too smooth in running and give us good excitement.,Access
2110,Its engine power is good around 124 cc but it controlling system is not good. It is vibrating when we are travelling from roadside.,Access
2111,Its fiber body so carfully drive. I also uncofortable to sit. Its not good. When I drive 50 -60 km then its back pained me. So I avoid long drives. Its 20-30 km range only preferd. Its avrage is neary 50 -55 km.,Access
2112,"Its fuel consumption too is supposed to be in the region of 48 to 50 Kms. with the lowest supposed to be 45 Km.

2113,Its gives normally 60 km/hr if you run economically and if you run at high speed then it gives average of 35 to 40km/hr/ The suspension is also better then the other bikes in same categary. The porn in this bike is that in rainy season the water easilily enter in filter and then you need to change the same. Except water enterng issue the bike is more friendely and comfort to ride.i will suggest to others to purchase the same.,Access
2114,Its glass system is seapret from other company .so its looks great.,Access
2115,Its got a much powerful engine than the others in this price range it is a 125 cubic engine that delivers a peppy acceleration than others but if mileage is your concern then plz dont go for this as it gives a very low mileage I have done a few tests but it could get to manage 35-40 top I driven it in economy speed which is 40 to 50 but then also the results dosen't vary much . And if talking about design its looks arent much good compared to other vechicles in the market. For youngsters looks matter but it dosen't seems to have a good design .,Access
2116,Its handle is quiet different for some people who go for access from activa or anyone else because its handle is little bit short in length but its grip is awesome and their is no issue in controlling the scooter because it is light in weight.,Access
2117,Its helps you to stop the bike while you are on road quick and easily.,Access
2118,Its higher setup of handle bar gives more control and confidence to the rider over the scooter. The floorboard is longer and wider which provides more area for legs. Seat is also wide and cushioned well. The placement of foot rests for the pillion rider is at the perfect place.,Access
2119,Its look very good as compare to other mopeds.new access looks like vespa.,Access
2120,Its looked like Activa Honda  but its not like that. its looking nice but not comfortable for long drive after 100km its want to take break.,Access

2122,Its mileage is average which will gives you 30+ mileage kmpl but this mileage is not so good for buying this.,Access
2123,Its mileage is very poor.  It takes lots of petrol.  My all pocket money finished in petrol. It is not comfortable due to small seats.  Its breake does not work properly. Some times its self start does not work properly. Its tyre works on road very badly.  And engine produce heat.,Access

2128,Its pavilion rider footrest is very stylish. It has also got good storage space. The petrol tank has a capacity of 6 Lt. It is good for a long journey.The seat has good cushion which is good for Indian roads. The front telescopic shock will give a better handling for the Indian roads.,Access

The mileage probably depends upon the user himself and his handling and the way of riding.I can also go up to 50 kmpl or can go down to 35 kmpl. proper care needs to be taken in terms of its servicing and the oil should be changed from time to time. the vehicle is very stylish looking and is very comfortable to ride. the acceleration is also very powerful and it is a completely reliable vehicle.

2392,Now its also have Mobile charger option its very convenient for mobile lovers those who want to keep their phone on all the time. Front pocket also use full for all. Disc brakes variant is excellent.,Access
2393,"Now its less than 10, 500 KMS and spark plug, holder, air intake hose, speedometer cable all has to be replaced. The clutch needs service every 45-60 days in normal Bangalore city driving!",Access
2394,"Now let me come to economy. The vehicle has given me 48 kmpl on my first ride, even before the first service. I expect it to go up to 60 kmpl after 2 or 3 services. The light focusing was not correct, I went to the showroom and they solved the problem in 2 minutes.",Access
2395,Now my question is what is the point collecting money on 27th dec 2010 so far what they have doing? And I come to know that immediately delivery extra 6000/- How come if I pay 6000/- extra I can get Vehicle with 10 Days?,Access
2396,Now my sister is planning for sale out the same and moving for activa because the activa is much better from this Suzuki Access,Access
2397,Now shall update the next mileage and experience figures once 5K is done after that shall put my long term report ie 1 year only. Hope this detailed review of mine help some one in deciding to buy this vehicle.,Access
2398,"Now that I took the vehicle and drove for more than a month, below are my views",Access
2399,Now the only thing I didnt like was the brake it is horrible as I have to tighten the brakes every week or so and the quality wasnt that good another thing is that spare body parts are hard to find.,Access
2400,Now this have many problems like skidding. And this self is not working currently so I am very unhappy. And this milage is pure. When buy this company said above 60kmpl but now this milage is below 40kmpl. So very pure bike. But this look and feel awesome. And performance wase you can buy this. Milage wise this is pure bike.,Access
2401,"Now to go for a new scooter of this category, I took sometime and judgement. Now, since I am used to riding such a two wheeler very much, I was looking for 1. Comfort, 2. Reliability, 3. Economy. For Comfort being the first choice, I had some options.",Access
2402,Now we come to its comfort so it was not that much comfortable rider is comfortable but the pillon can't sit that much comfortablly.,Access

2404,Nowadays there are different kind of scooters which are better than these Honda Activa and access but at my time there was only 3 option Honda Activa Suzuki Access 125 and pleasure,Access
2405,"OK we shell our Rs.1700+ for the so called accessories- every two wheeler company put up the mat, handle cover etc as complimentary( Honda gives it) these dealers are so figitive with every paise they try to grab from the customer.",Access
2406,"Of course I have waited for 2 months in baroda. But my waiting period is worth. No other scooter in this category is near to suzuki 125 access and black color has a superb look. I had experience of bajaj super, bajaj chetak and lastly of activa for last 20 years. But i still prefer the suzuki 125 access as best scooter of the decade.",Access
2407,"Of course the vendor provides two years maintenance free cum paid service, sandwiched in between, a clever ploy to retain the customer with them. Spare parts are not available any whether other than with the vendor who are hardly one or two in a metro like Chennai. The rim also does not withstand bump which are common in our Indian roads.",Access
2408,"Of late one can view spate of advertisment being beamed through channels on this Suzuki Access 125. We purchased it when it was introduced in the market.  It is since a year we have been using this vehicle. We were advised by our vendor to get front guard fixed to our scooter to avoid dent to the front portion. It fell down on the day it was fixed during ride. Subsequently we were advised by one of their mechanic that the guard will not withstand the front portion as body covering the front tyre is made up of plastic. The front plastic cover, in due course, also got crack and the vendor refused to change it though it was a manufacturing defect. The vehicle requires frequent refill of engine oil as otherwise the vehicle fails to run smoothly and some kind of rugged noise emanates from the engine.",Access
2409,Of the buyer I dont believed that a superb scooter and my scooter is a access and iam using  this bike access is good looking shine,Access
2410,On  4th Oct 2012 once again I argue with the service center manager as please give all the service details those your people done during these services done for my vehicle so I have to mail to Suzuki Co. fro wrest mileage.

The special edition is available only in Pear Mirage White colour and features ‘Apna Way of life’ logo. Other features in the Special Edition include beige leather seat cover, chrome grab rail and rear view mirrors. The special edition Access 125 is more expensive than the standard edition of Access 125.",Access
2412,"On Road price 52300+ 3000 for steel bumpers, (very effective and necessary)",Access
2413,"On going through the reviews, there are enough complaints regarding servicing and about the dealers.May be it is a universal phenomena. as far as ACCESS dealers are concerned. It seems that the Customer Service Department is quite ineffective and inefficient.Its high time the CSD has to go through the reviews if the company is genuinely interested in their customers.",Access
2414,"On paper, the figures don't seem much, but the 2016 Suzuki Access 125 impressed us every time you pin the throttle open. It's not lightning fast off the block, but the scooter's got enough grunt to give a sense of a strong, solid performer. Acceleration is smooth and linear, and we managed to hit a speedo-indicated top speed of just over 90kmph, and while it does that, there's no vibration or protest from the engine, even at high speeds. Even with a pillion on board ( a rather heavy one at that) , the Access 125 pulls without giving any sense of feeling stressed.",Access
2415,"On performance side this bikes with lighter weight gave it quick pickup and ease drive with or without a pillion rider. A 125 cc engine throws sufficient power which was missing in lower cc scooties like Activa 3G. For a taller guy with this scooty(more than 5.8"") you will not feels hazels cause your hands will be straiten and legs won't bend due to higher ground base. It results with less tiredness in long run.",Access

2417,"On the first free service they took 3 days to service the vehicle and they had also caused a minor dent on mud guard which they did not accepted happened by them. When asked about the dent on mud guard, the supervisor blamed that it was already there before the vehicle given for service and misbehaved. Mileage is also very poor, very uneconomical.",Access
2418,"On the flyover the bike head is just up even if it is loaded with weight of more than 150Kg, many times I travelled with 150 Kg on it and never noticed any slow moving action of it on flyover. Even if big vehicle passes the vehicle never vibrates to its own way. The engine does not make too much noise but when you switch off then you can hear a “tick” sound from engine.",Access
2419,"On the move, the shed weight shows through in the way that the Access feels lighter on its feet while the larger front wheel offers more confidence with a taller, more upright stance. The new Access is nimbler than its forerunner for sure but surprisingly changes characteristics in a few areas where the latter excelled. The added torque and lesser weight makes for brisk starts off-the-line but beyond 65kmph, power delivery softens in the mid-range and tapers off towards the top-end of the rev-range. This is quite unlike the zippy, sprightly performance of the older scooter.",Access
2420,On the other hand one more thing which I didnot like was that its pickup.which is also.baad one.,Access
2421,On the other side the poor side of access is only its average per litre but it can be overcome by maintainance easily.,Access
2422,"On the way from Vespa showroom I went to Suzuki showroom and test drove the Access 125, it was the same little impressive scoot, that I liked few months back. Enquires about the Disc and alloy version and got a positive reaponse. It was good that there was no booking process involved, but I was told there were only two colors available with them in Access disc variant, White and Blue. Having seen both the colors I chose blue. On the D day, I just called the SA in the morning and told him that I will take delivery of the Blue Access 125 Disc brake variant with just three accessories(Ladies foot rest, indicator buzzer and mobile charger provision), he was happy to oblige. Went there in the evening, made the payment and there it was, my Blue bird.",Access
2423,On the whole its a reliable urban commuting vehicle offering great value for money at 44000/- onroad pune and .,Access
2424,"Once got a glance of Access while passing through Suzuki Sub-dealership in the town. Entered into the show room & took a test drive. Simply floored........., never thought scooter driving can so much of fun. The pick up was mind blowing & the smothness was something to be envied. That moment decided to buy one scooter from this segment & real research started after that. Took test ride of Honda Aviator- Smooth, pick up not awsome as Access ; Flyte- Pick up not good as access, smooth, ground clearance was pathetic- grazed less than normal height bumpers with a pillion rider regularly ; pleasure- girlish look, too small storage space , lack of telescopic front suspension ; New Honda Activa- did not get chance to test drive as the model was out of stock, but probably may not have considered due to not so encouraging review on MS , lack of telescopic front suspension.",Access
2425,"Once out of craze, I had been to my relatives place 30 km away with my family with the scooter . We were four ( daughter- 11 yrs old- wt 45 kg., son- 5 yrs old-16kg, myself- 70 kg, wife-52 kg). The journey was not comfortable. While coming back, my daughter refused to return with us. But still with rest three of us ( son standing in front) , the journey was not as comfortable as expected by me , though the level of comfort improved as compared to our out -ward journey.",Access
2426,Once the bike will get repair alternatively we have to go to the mechanic shop.so my friends be careful when are buying a bike before buying know about it.,Access
2427,"Once the vehicle starts noise of it goes a bit wild but when the vehicle reaches 40Km mark, absolutely there would be no sound from the engine would be heard. Mileage is between 48 to 50. But I advise that let the mind be prefixed to a mileage of 45Km's per liter. On the whole I would suggest inspiring purchasers to go ahead with this vehicle wherein you will not repent for the money you spent. Thanks for spending your time, Good Luck. S N Murthy",Access
2428,"Once we ride this scooter, the power attracts us and ask us to buy it.I planned to buy a 110cc scooter but during the test drive it just conquered my heart.",Access
2429,Once you buy a scooter from them they do not care/Respond to your queries. At a speed of 40 it runs as if 20 speed. Please do not buy this vehicle.,Access

2431,"One Of The Best Scooter For Every Indiviual. Excellent Looks. It Gives Mileage Upto 59 kmpl. Price 59000( INR) . I Am Using This Bike For About 15 days. Decent Scooter. Engine Is Not So Noisy At High Speed. Cool Colours: White, Glass Sparkle Red, Metallic Fibroin Grey, Metalic Sonic Silver, Peral Mirage White.",Access
2432,"One advantage though is that its forks are telescopic bike like! Rear suspension and comfort is excellent while the firmness of the cushion is also very good. Nothing much to differentiate from Activa here. Access comes with rear foot pegs, side stands, floor mat, mirrors and without stepney. The body is anti-rust due to it being non-metallic but inspite of this it was heavier(see above) isn’t it? If you forget its an 125 cc engine so the engine weight comes into play! The fit and finish was damn good where both Activa as well as Access scores here…nothing to differentiate. Head lights of Access is much superior with good focus and increased power as compared to Activa though I would have loved to evaluate this in night condition instead of day. Vibration was almost nil during the short ride. Before I forget…Access has a shutter mechanism for its key hole.",Access
2433,"One aspect that could be improved is the availability of additional color options. While the existing color choices are decent, a wider range of options would allow riders to personalize their scooter according to their preferences.",Access
2434,"One bad about this Suzuki access is not able to find any mechanic who can repair it correctly. Only authorised Suzuki persons could only repair it well. And also there is no availability of spare part  in the market, one has to go to showroom for buying the spare parts. No other choice.",Access
2435,One biggest thing it loses against Honda is that Indians still prefer Honda as honda being a promising and their trust on honda.,Access
2436,One cannot use kicker if the center stand is removed. but in Honda Activa this is not so like this.,Access
2437,One day I going this scooty my office I saw on highway good contoral and good picup.good milage and good contoral market.,Access
2438,"One favorable position however is that its forks are adjustable bicycle like! Raise suspension and solace is great while the immovability of the pad is likewise great. Not a lot to separate from Activa here. Get to accompanies raise foot pegs, side stands, floor tangle, mirrors and without stepney. The body is against rust because of it being non-metallic however inspite of this it was heavier(see above) would it say it isn't? In the event that you overlook its a 125 cc motor so the motor weight becomes possibly the most important factor! The fit and complete was damn great where both Activa and in addition Access scores here… nothing to separate. Head lights of Access is much unrivaled with great concentration and expanded power when contrasted with Activa however I would have wanted to assess this in night condition rather than day. Vibration was practically nil amid the short ride. Before it slips my mind… Access has a shade system for its key opening.",Access

2441,"One look and it's apparent that the all-new Suzuki Access 125 won't win any beauty contests, and it's not likely to turn too many heads on the street as well. But one thing is certain, the all-new Access 125 looks big, and quite handsome. It's cut out in gracious lines rather than being fashionably hip and doesn't make a loud, brash statement.",Access
2442,One more draw back is there is no external fuel filling and the main thing is mileage and reliability of the bike.,Access
2443,One more drawback is there is no external fuel filling and the main thing is mileage and reliability of the bike.,Access
2444,One more in access silencer elevation is too worst.(technically it is good) but looks are bad.Any howw thanks to all the reviews on Access which makes my mind towards Access,Access
2445,"One more intresting fact is that it should give more mileage as and when compared to activa's old v-matic engine at least theoretically it should give 8 to 10 km more then activa because of its cvt engine(if you are wondering what is CVT? and its benefits then go to wikipedia.com and learn by yourself.)  Some important tips for improved mileage(1)kick start in morning(2) dont overthrottle (3)keep the vehicle weight to minimium i.e More weight=require more power=more fuel=less mileage.(4)Never ever turn off your engine while still in motion, i.e to save fuel etc . by doing so you will harm your vehicles catalytic converter.(5) dont use break unnecessarily",Access

2452,"One of the WORST Suzuki showrooms in Bangalore. Abolutely PATHETIC service. After our visit in 3-4 showrooms in Bangalore, we went ahead with Avanish because of their price. But after booking, first they increased the Price of the vehicle. They make us travel all the way to showroom to hear this. It is very DISAPPOINTING! Secondly, they promise dates they can never. They said 2 days but finally after some 20 calls from our side they delivered after 1 week. Very LETHARGIC and SLOW agents who have absolutely no sense of Responsibility. They don't deserve to serve any customer like this. Now, after promising the registration and number plate, it's been almost a month and we haven't got any number plate. Moreover the out complaints about brake and noises from the vehicle were completely IGNORED by the sales and service people. I hope somebody from suzuki looks into this because their brand is certainly going down the drains if people like these keep serving.",Access
2453,One of the bad looking scooter I have ever seen. Mileage may be good but in sense of look it's the worst. Its acceleration is too hard and also not so good like other scooter its road grip is also Bad it's body is not so balanced. Its a heavy scootwr,Access
2454,"One of the best gearless drive vehicle with MILEAGE of 50kmpl on average, high comfort zone is achieved due to width of seat and space provided for foot rest and easy to keep heavy baggage and material for personal transportation purpose and has a good APPEAL. ROAD GRIP is very high,chance of skid is minimum at average speed of 50Km/Hr on dry but on wet days speed should be minimised . PICK UP is very high can compete with sports bike like PULSAR 150 BUT regular servicing is required for better service and life of vehicle. It is a RELIABLE product of suzuki and can be trusted for safe journey and long life.",Access
2455,One of the best scooty in 125 cc segment. The mileage of the vehicle is about to be 52kmpl. Riding experience is fabulous. Maintenance is very less.Change filter and spark plugs after every 7000 km. To get better mileage. And maintain tyre pressure 30 psi front and 40 psi rear. It is first scooty I purchased and satisfied with performance,Access
2456,One of the better scooties.i have had one for 3 years in a hillstaton and it's power hasn't decreased a bit.milage is pretty good I can travel like 55km for just hundered rupees gas.looks are not pretty bad either.it has huge under seat space it also dosen't require a whole lot of maintianance if I were to rate between activa and access I would go for access.,Access
2457,One of the main reasons I booked this is the front shock absorbers. Also the clicking sound of the side stands is good and the same stands out. The Storage capacity seems to be good and spacious too.,Access
2458,"One of the standout features of the Access 125 is its design. Suzuki has done a great job of blending modern aesthetics with a classic scooter silhouette. The sharp lines and sleek bodywork give it a contemporary look, while the chrome accents add a touch of elegance. The overall design is appealing and eye-catching, making the Access 125 a scooter that turns heads on the road.",Access
2459,"One of the things I like most about this scooter is its performance. The engine is powerful and responsive, allowing me to zip through city traffic easily. It accelerates smoothly, and the ride quality is comfortable, even on bumpy roads. The scooter feels stable and balanced while riding at higher speeds.",Access
2460,"One personal suggestion, go for white.  It doesn't fade away with time. Black looks good but it has to be maintained.",Access
2461,"One surprising this is that I went for the remaining accessories that they promised, and they got a front grill which covers that front lights were shaped very awkwardly. Except the manager nobody is interested to respond properly there... any some how I could manage to remove them and said to get the old good model of the grill.",Access
2462,"One thing is fine with this bike i.e the comfort level while travelling even in odd roads, it is able to give you a proper grip in such conditions.",Access
2463,"One thing is that I had done in the first service, adjustment of dim light to down as you can not get the lights clearly when travelling in night. The horn is ok to extend of requirement and you can realize it only when you don’t wear helmet. The bike has got very big space below to seat where I can keep my big helmet (not all helmets can be fitted to it you need to check before you go for purchase of helmet). The bike has got attractive look where you can notice some people’s eyes on it when you take for ride. The bike looks so trendy and athletic that you feel that this bike is made for all family peoples.",Access
2464,"One thing is very disturbing in this bike is that the whole body of bike is of fiber (plastics) and small touch of any other bike  or road or any other things will make scratch to it for permanent and you can not remove it or paint it like active Honda has option of painting. So this bike is very delicious so you need to take special care when travelling in slow moving traffic of heavy signals. This bike is not dust proof bike and within one day it will get very dirty although if it is cleaned pervious day. I also had problem with kick-start but it was due to new engine in the beginning and now with one kick it gets start. I thought horn is not good enough but noticed its effect only when tried without helmet and for some extend it is ok. It has all other futures like chrome plate, theft device, unique tail lights and body shape.",Access
2465,"One thing that could be improved is the suspension. While it handles most bumps and potholes well, I sometimes feel a bit of jolt on rough surfaces. A slightly softer suspension would make the ride even smoother.",Access
2466,"One thing we should be aware of that the steel guards does not fit properly on the front mudguard, mine fell down on the second day itself while I was driving this is dangerous, I got this fitted with the help of screws and nut-bolds insides the mudguard at home only. After that there hasn’t been any problem with that.",Access

2470,Only frustrating thing is long waiting time for getting the vehicle in hand after booking the vehicle(2-4 months depending on the dealer).,Access
2471,Only glich is initial milege( 37 kmpl for a run of 104 kms) but hope will improve. Though feel handling a little bit tricky on Pune's monsoon ravaged roads but could be due to the fact that I am more used to driving car. Start & Pick up are like a breeze. vehicle is powerful & it shows. You can feel the power the moment the signal turns green( & people green wth envy) Though I find centre stand a bit heavy to operate. A how to in this regard answer from any body is welcome. Breaks ae reasonably good.,Access
2472,"Only handling of this scooter can be said as good, because of its small height and light handle weight which makes it easy to handle",Access

2481,Others will come in your way. Head light was pointing to sky as other wrote but can be adjusted by adjusting the screw below the head light set outside which is written in the manual. Here is the problem. When you adjust the headlight the gap between the headlight body and the frame widens and you will feel the the resistance at high speed due to air rushing through that gap. Luggage space is very less and helmet space is just enough. Dust will easily enter the luggage space may be due to seat not fitting air tight. Silencer is bit outwards and easy chance to get hit from backside.,Access
2482,"Our first taste of the new Suzuki was in the city. The first pleasant realisation was that the two chunky testers on board had clear air between them. Clearly, the new longer seat is long enough. Secondly, despite the considerable payload that we presented, the Access was handling the rigours of the city without letting out so much so as a whimper. Even as the engine was put under high loads, it remained smooth and quiet. At lower speeds, throttle response is prompt, and it pulled in a linear manner even as speeds climbed.",Access
2483,Over all a nicely packaged vehicle with very less advertisement .. Shall update more on the mileage front and other experiences later...,Access
2484,Over all its a very good product of Suzuki and Suzuki can become popular with this again.,Access

All these problems are from day one. Before two days anathor problem has cropped up- while accelarating from slow speed, peculiar sound is produced some where from rear for a moment & vanishes afterwards.

The looks of the Access were nothing extraordinary, and form several angles, it looked like Suzuki had copied the market leader, Activa. There were some significant changes though, in terms of features. The seat on the Access was a flat one as opposed to the bi-level seat on the Hondas. The Suzuki had the ability to open the seat from the ignition console itself.",Access

2721,So I appeal to not to relia on this two wheeler as due to its poor road grip you mabe in trouble at an time.,Access
2722,So I recommend you guys the Suzuki Access 125 as it is considerably one of the best Suzuki products available.,Access

2724,"So I researched a lot before buying this, where I compared to this with a Activa 125 and other category bike which lie in this range.",Access
2725,"So I suggest before buying any Suzuki product, check whether you have a good service where you buy. (This applies common to all Suzuki product - bikes and Scooters).",Access
2726,So I think that every should try this scooty .My experience that you will not face any problem as well as.,Access
2727,"So I was about to book Honda Activa Gray/Purple for my sister, But one day I was reading some reviews on mouthshut and found that Suzuki access having more % of satisfied customers than any other scooty. There it changed my mind. Then I did lots of research on access and read lots of reviews of it.",Access
2728,"So Overall I will give 8/10 for the scooter. Its a powerful, Value for Money, family scooter",Access
2729,So according to me this scooter shows its best results in year 2017 and will going to be more better in next coming yrs.,Access
2730,So activa is much better than access except millege and suspention.,Access
2731,"So after lots of reviews on all these scooties, and lots of ups and downs, I rejected dio because it looks like more school going kid scooty, then dropped pep caz of its so thin body and it definately wont suit to me.",Access
2732,"So after many thoughts I zeroed on Suzuki Access. So I went to dealer in Rajajinagar and queried. To my surprize I got to know that 3 months is the waiting time. So I had two options wait or go for activa. But my feeling was to buy Access, so I bargained with the dealer and payed him full cost (51K with accessories ) one shot and got down the delivery to 10 days flat.",Access
2733,So after owning 2gen activas and honda dio im here to write about suzuki access ownership of 9 months( sold it by then ),Access
2734,So am strongly recommend that must not buy this product from suzuki,Access
2735,"So coming to Vehicle: Good, Smart, felt the Comfort in long ride, all of our family members praised about the vehicle.usually a machine will not give 100% performance after it being used, yes. I am facing couple problems like shutter lock is not functioning and till now I never mind about mileage in any of my bikes(Splendor, CBZ) beyond what manufacturer preferred, but there is some thing unusual is happening in the petrol consumption in my access 125. Am not interested to go again to that dealer and local mechanic will not take care with such importance. Till now just changing the engine oil every year or once in 6 months.it's going well, no major issues.i prefer it.next planning to buy same machine or suzuki swish.happy riding.",Access
2736,"So don't buy this product, its better to buy honda activa 3G.suzuki access is not resonable product.",Access
2737,"So firstly let me tell u about the Vehical Milage, it gives upto 40 per litre if we mainten well by doing time to time Services, are it may drop to 30 to 35 per litre .",Access
2738,"So folks except for the mileage, I am completely satisfied with this rocket machine (Non-Gear category). I have not got any mechanical problems with the bike ever since I bought it 7 months ago. So decide for yourself people. May be people who drive more smoothly can have a better hand on the mileage. Let me know your views.",Access
2739,So for long ride it's fuel consumption is too good as it runs at the same as well as the other bike.,Access
2740,So friends we cannot bye this scooty because of its design and specifications so go for next,Access
2741,So guys why r wastes u r money in this bike lets a thnigs bigginer a futures time worked possible for all good work so dont buy this buy the another amazing bike.,Access
2742,So here people started to chose access and hence the scooter got popular.,Access
2743,"So if you ask me. I feel this is the best scooter as compared to the other 100cc, 110cc and 125cc category .",Access
2744,"So if you want to get a spirited and agile performance from a scooter equal to a bike at the cost of little more fuel cost then go for access, but it you are concerned only about fuel efficiency, then better go with Activa, Wego or Jupiter. I think the only scooter that could beat access in performance is Vespa. But it is expensive. It is also better to buy Swish instead of access. Both are exactly same, just that swish has better looks and lighter than access.  Hope my review has helped you.",Access
2745,So in if you. Ask me to buy this scooter l'm not going to buy this and in last it's on you to buy or not to buy,Access
2746,So in rainy season it require proper servicing and 2-3 times yearly.,Access
2747,So in short I paid 71000 to the showroom after corporate discount(1350)+ 5000 cashback it fell only 65000 for me with installed mobile charger and all round steel guard.,Access
2748,"So in this way Suzuki just for sales saying 64kmpl but I am not sure according to which standards. Everything is fine like smoothness, ride quality but engine sound n vibration or vehicle belt moving felt even when driving n using Helmet. Morning start or cold start problems. exists in new model too.",Access
2749,So many types of colours and nice look is very impress me and people.,Access
2750,So my advise is that better be in 40 kmph speed in city (if you are an expert rider who can control the access even at 90+ then you can even ride at 90+ in city also no problem at all) and in highways you can be at 90+ but be carefull with the incoming traffic,Access
2751,"So my dear friends my sincere request is please dont go for access and ruin your time, money and health.......................",Access
2752,So my final opinion is that one should think twice before purchasing this scooter and rest is you decision.,Access
2753,"So my this update for mainly two reasons, first I want all the other scooty owners to learn this new kinda fatal scene with ur scooty so if ever u fall down from ur scooty and if its right handle hits the road then better first put ur scooty on main stand then take full control of it and then only starts it and never give it to weak or short or ladies like that, u need to check it completely and it s that main clutch near right handle bar. 2nd reason for the access team to work on this and remove this negative point from ur scooty as it could even make sum1s life miserable. Luckily my sister was in the local area not on the main road and she was survived from this. But its not necessary every time same thing will happen with others too, could b more could b less.",Access
2754,"So no matter whether you are driving alone or with someone else, you will never feel like the scooter is losing power. The breaking is good, milage is fine too, 40kmpl. The seats are very comfortable. The vehicle has a bit of a weight but that doesn't hamper it's smooth handling. You are gonna love to ride in this vehicle.",Access
2755,So now when can I get my vehicle please send mail communication. And also please look into this issue and resole as earliest.,Access
2756,So once again I encourage and request all people who wish to buy a Family Two Wheeler. simply go for Suzuki Access 125.,Access
2757,"So overall, I would not suggest this bike at the price point.",Access
2758,"So please for Kerala we need some more service stations for this scooter the mileage for this one is only at 30 to 35 km and the harassing paid service its very cruel in Cochin, actually in a free service, for oil change the labour charge is Rs.250.00.",Access
2759,So read this review feel good bout it & go & test ride it.I am sure this wont let u down.,Access
2760,So thats it I literally loved this scooter as at this pricing this was competitive,Access
2761,"So the Pulsar, Unicorn, Fazer kind of bikes have been selling in good numbers even though they consume relatively more fuel Similarly, scooters are no longer driven only  by  ladies and aged people. Even people who want to enjoy driving, opt for scooters due to their convenience, appearance and space. Scooters are also best to go with the family. Today it is common to see lots of college students to go on activa, dio, ray, access, vespa etc.",Access
2762,So the second version launched by Suzuki Access 125 has a lot of improvements and unlike the first version .,Access
2763,So where we used to compete with other vehicles like activa and fascino and duro .The Access 125 would run like anything . I am in love with this vehicle,Access
2764,"So why not buy a 125 cc scooter for the same price. Now the only thing I am skeptical bout is that Access is a fairly new scooter, was launched around navratri so I have no idea about its long term performance. And secondly since am a bit short was finding it difficult to rest my feet. But all in all I think it is a great scooter and the honda people have some tough competition on their hands now.",Access
2765,"So with my personal expereinece, I would higly recommend NOT TO GO with this product. I wish I would have gone with the market - Honda Activa or Aviator.",Access
2766,So without reviews as to how the performance would the bike would provide I purchased it.,Access
2767,So you can't thing that you go so far on this scooty . And also the position of handling this make really tough to drive it .,Access
2768,So! I buy it but I am not haapy with it but after use it only first time I love it and it`s mileage is very good about 45 KM to 50KM it is seat give very comfort and it have reliability and it`s road grip is very very good it is better than activa . When I drive it I never move the handel because when I give force on any side it automaticly turn in that direction and it become to touch my side foot stad to touch to ground but it`s girp on road give balance to drive it and it speed is 1 to 50 km/h in only 15 to 20 sec and in less time also I appeal you to buy it,Access
2769,"So, I suggest access 125 who need a powerful and comfortable ride.",Access
2770,"So, finally I decided to go for either of Honda Aviator or Suzuki Access. I went to SMK showroom at Guindy, Chennai one evening. I found that they are offering me 26k for my Activa, which is pretty decent to my opinion, as I had to already repair the vehicle. Hence I booked my Access, as also the height is less and hence my wife could also manage to get both her foot on the ground. The weight of the vehicle is less than Activa (109 kgs compared to 117 kgs of Activa). After going for the test ride, I got impressed with the vehicle. Finally I got the vehicle delivered on last Sunday, the 14th of March, 2010. I took my wife along and traveled back home with the vehicle, a distance of around 16 kms from my home. The ride was smooth and I never felt the weight of the pillion rider, as I used to do in Activa. After then since now I have traveled a distance of around 370 kms. Still now the pickup and smoothness of the vehicle is amazing. With the powerful 125 cc engine compared to Honda's 110 cc, whatever the traffic may be, the vehicle just cruises through the crowd. The brakes are very powerful, which gave me more comfort and elegance to handle it around the traffic. Even I have twisted and turned around the heavy traffic, but it never showed a single sign to skid. Overall I am highly satisfied with the vehicle's performance.",Access
2771,"So, the all-new Suzuki Access 125 is lighter, fuel efficient and has universally acceptable looks. At Rs 53, 887(ex-showroom Delhi), it's also a couple of thousand rupees less expensive than the segment leader Honda Activa 125.

It is not as much power and without front disc it is also unappealing. The brakes are not good. Seat is not good as they are flat or power is also the big lack in this scooter. Hence I am not suppose to anyone to purchase this.,Access

3214,"The all new Suzuki Access 125 REALLY is brand new, almost every bit from chassis and engine to improved torque. Suzuki has always brought noticeable diffrence in every new launch. They surely have understood the like mind of indian customes. Its also provide cellphone charging facility in it which is very much good. Hence its very good in average, pick up as compare to Honda Activa 125, and I feel the diffrence in comfort and ride quality between access 125 and Honda activa 125, I found access is more better.",Access
3215,The all new Suzuki Access 125 is first in its segment with 125 cc revamped appealing design and is loaded with a bunch of new features.,Access
3216,The all new Suzuki Access 125 is one of the best scooter released by the Suzuki. I bought this couple of months ago and testing on it that is it really good or not but its really comfortable and stylish and economy too. I felt very convent while riding on it even the seat space is very long you can sit three peoples comfortably and its space for containing various items is very depth and large in compare of other scooters and a very good switch key system attached with the power switch for accessing on your dicky overall its good and give proper millage as promise. A good one by Suzuki.,Access

The all new access have mileage 64 but in a road he give 55-60 mileage is better than activate 125 and acceleration is exellent with all new pickup power compare to activate 125 is not a good with access 125 for price,Access

3220,"The apathy from them is just beyond imagination. In today's world, at least the manufacturer and/or distributors of ACCESS 125 just do not bother for the csutomers even if he/she loses the life. Please think twice before you buy it. I am sure life is more precious that anything else.",Access
3221,The appeal was that the company should retake it from every where and make it lighter and.with more attrative looks.,Access
3222,The are many misconseptions about the MILAGE but if u do an proper mentainance and proper driving it gives an promising 40kmpl milage for sure.,Access

3226,The back rear shock is also very good. The ground clearance is also very good. The weight is ideal for the scooter. Thus it very useful for a gents also due t its large appearance.Now I have I new problem.It stalls when riding in rain. Do anyone have this problem.,Access

3232,"The best part about this scooter is its new and improved 124cc engine. Producing 8.5bhp and 10.2Nm, power and displacement remain the same, but this motor is lighter and uses the company’s SEP tech to improve performance and efficiency. Considering the reduction in weight, the new Access feels very brisk off the line. The way the engine goes about its business is highly commendable. It’s smooth and very refined. The engine didn’t feel stressed while maintaining speeds of 70-75kph down the highway, and it returned a satisfactory 45kpl while at it.",Access
3233,"The best scooty in it's segment.I am riding this vehicle since 4 years and I am fully satisfied with its performance.it is the more powerful vehicle in its segment .its handling is very good , I feel it't handling better than any other scooty.but there is one problem with the vehicle, it's odometer is not working properly it gets damaged within a short period of time.over all the scooty is a good deal to have.",Access
3234,The best thing about this is its pick up. It has a high pick up compared to its competitors. And also its seat is wide enough and comfortable. The only thing I didn't like about it is its front Suspension and their design they are Telescopic but a little long in length.,Access
3235,The best thing about this vehicle is the acceleration power but the only downfall is rear brakes other wise everything is perfect and there is one more good feature that you can open the tool box compartment from the key lock itself.,Access
3236,"The best thing is its pickup.i garauntee it that no other scooty can have as fast as pickup comapre to suzuki . Everyone will say our vehicle gives 60 average but it is not correct . after few time it reduces. You can find different colors here.like grey , white , black.",Access

3246,"The bland styling was among the biggest drawbacks of the Access 125 and it wasn’t the most appealing scooters on sale. Gladly, Suzuki designers have taken stock of the situation and given the new Access 125 a fresh lease of life with respect to its appearance.",Access
3247,"The body is rust-free as it is made mostly of fibre glass. However, a significant impact may cause it to break, in which case the only option would be to replace the entire panel. In my opinion, the chance of this happening is quite rare. Any scratches and nicks can be fixed at the paint shop.",Access
3248,The body of bike made of very low quality material.Even it don't give you full mileage.and also it don't look great like other scooters in market.,Access
3249,"The boys generation is becomes the huge fan of tha suzuki access 125. The look is so much good of that scooter. The suzuki access is available in different colors like blue, black, silver. Etc. I bought blue colour suzuki access. Also is having super mileage. Mileage is 40km",Access
3250,The brakes of the scooty are also good which makes the ride safe.,Access
3251,"The braking was taken care of  by drums on both the wheels.  The rear brake seemed to be more responsive as compared to the front and together they managed to haul down the vehicle pretty rapidly.  So no issues here.  The vehicle when in motion was quite silent and no vibration could be felt anywhere.  Not from the footboard, nor from the seat or from the handlebar.  This means that this scooter is extremely well engineered and designed to give you an enjoyable ride without the hassles that normally accompany the ride.",Access
3252,The brand of suzuki access 125 is very hopeful its presence his company status its road on grip was so much its 125 cc enjen was practically comfortable runnig so fastly that his own maintenance was chiefly so much girls shoud be like it because its figure( its design) was very good,Access

3254,"The build quality of vehicle is first class. Handling even in heavy traffic is comfortable.its suspension is pretty good and gives us smooth ride even on bad roads.over taking is easy task on this vehicle, but I am only just satisfied with the braking.a front disc brake could have given a great confidence to the scooter.",Access

3258,"The central lock should be improved. If u have a bike with central lock, try to open it by twisting ur finger. It opens easily. It  no longer matters but it should be appropriate.",Access
3259,The central locking system(one key for the ignition as well as the seat storage) is useful as you would need just one key. The shutter over the ignition key-hole is also a good security mechanism.,Access
3260,The centrel locking is great.Specialy the key entrence  blocking.,Access
3261,The chrome plated part of the exhaust gives the vehicle a unique look. The front indicators are not located in the handle bar which is a welcome change from the regular styling. The Access 125 being priced about 3000.00 higher than the Activa should have featured a front disk brake. But overall the vehicle is worth it.,Access
3262,The color of Scooter also gone dull and its not seems new and stylish and we never received any kind of appreciation during using the same,Access
3263,The comfort is gud and all it takes very nicely seats well cushioned,Access
3264,The comfort is okay in my terms. Seat quality comes okay with decent cushioning.,Access
3265,The comfort level of this bike is very very good and totally satisfied from sitting and using this and feels more enjoyable to ride on this.,Access
3266,The comfort level of this scooter is also not much good it is very uncomfortable to sit on the seat of this scooter.,Access
3267,The company Suzuki has been producing many different models in cars as well as bikes from soo many years. For cars I would prefer and recommend suzuki.,Access
3268,The company claims that the scooty should be services once in 3 months and a services costs around 1500 bucks . The engine provides a good pickup than any other scooty . But pros is one and cons are many .,Access
3269,The company does not seem to care what the costumer has to say. Yesterday the body of my access cracked with a loud sound. Instead of accepting the fault they are giving me all kinds of excuses.  Think twice before you buy this vehicle.,Access
3270,"The comparison game might sound cool speaking about specifications, what is good what is not. But we need to make an important statement that all of the comparison scooters had made entry into the market at the right time. This is the reason why they all were a hit to an extent, but unlike Activa which is rolling out still in large number, Vespa 125 had limited success. Now let us take you through the comparison between the 125 cc segment scooter with specifications and overview.",Access
3271,"The comparison game might sound cool speaking about specifications, what is good what is not. But we neee vehicle these  vehicle family.",Access
3272,The dealer did not have the complete accessory set when I bought the bike; had to go back after 10 days to get the accessories fixed.,Access
3273,"The dealers of suzuki claim that since the vehicle is new, and the mileage will increase after 1 or 2 services.",Access
3274,"The dealers say they offer genuine spare parts but I believe 100 percent they dont provide the genuine parts. They say that parts life depend on the driver of the bike. Yes, I agree but Are we small children and dont know how to ride a bike? This is only a starting point of my trouble.",Access
3275,The design  and style of suzuki access 125 looks very beautiful. also we have more color available in market. you can choose any one of them and enjoy the ride.,Access
3276,The design is good but performance as per review not good. I think there is some issue with engine.,Access
3277,"The design is somrwhat similar to the first gen Activa.it starts vibrating aftertouching 60.mileage is not at all great. Except the front telescopic suspensions it has got nothing excellent to offer! Activa110/125, Aviator, Jupiter, Wego, Vespa go for these.way better than Suzuki Access",Access
3278,The design is too good . the performance is worst . first it is not a fuel efficient scooter I am using it from last 4 years . my fuel expence is too much compairing to other scooters .,Access
3279,The design of this scooter is something type of retro classic. You get a readable instrument cluster. The seat of this scooter is very comfortable. The scooter is very powerfull though it is powered by the 125cc engine. It has a very good pickup. You can carry your loads easily. You will not feel any power loss.,Access
3280,"The display is all new too, but comes across as a rather bland effort at bettering the competition. It is rather simplistic in design. The dominant analogue part gives clear indication of speed, the tiny digital display section reads out odometer, fuel gauge, service reminder and two trip meter figures.",Access
3281,"The downside if there was one, would be the seat, even if it's quite plush and comfortable. At 780mm, the seat height isn't quite accessible for riders of all heights, and what compounds matters is the width of the rider seat. So, at a little over 5'9"", I couldn't put my feet flat on the ground at stop lights, so this could be a challenge for some riders. But the new Access 125 also loses weight - a good 10kg at that - over the older model; so it's got better power-to-weight ratio and easy manoeuvrability. At a claimed 64kmpl fuel economy, expect fuel consumption to be in the high 40s or even 50kmpl in the real world.",Access
3282,The drive was very Smooth and powerful Comparatively other vehicles.It's average is little lover Comparatively other other vehicles due tu it's heavy weight.My access is giving 40kmpl milage. If you want a vehicle with power and smooth performance then it's the best vehicle I recommend.,Access
3283,The engine comes with 125 cc of power which is decent and well for indian road condotions but lacks in power .,Access
3284,The engine comes with 125 cc of power which is decent and well for indian road condotions but lacks in power I would say. The pickup of the this scooter is slow. Initially when you try to accelarate it does not go instantly. It gives a sudden jerk after one or two seconds and then accelarates.,Access
3285,"The engine has always started the first time around, even when I hadn't driven it for a week(I always kick-start the vehicle the first time in the morning, as per the advice from the dealer).",Access
3286,"The engine is a 125cc paired with a CVT gearbox, good for an output of 8.5bhp. Which if take notice, is not that puny for a scooter. There is enough torque to pull two full grown adults. The stability and smoothness of the engine is fantastic at speeds above 60kmph.",Access
3287,The engine is located right below the seat storage which causes the storage area to warm up quite a bit even after a short ride.,Access
3288,The engine is more powerfull in new version and the pick up is very good. It achive  42 to 60 kilometre per hour speed in very few seconds.,Access
3289,"The engine is smooth, fuel efficient and starts without any hassles though its advisable to use the kick during coldstarts.",Access
3290,"The engine is so good and smooth even when we reach 80 km/h in highway, there is no vibration and hard sound.",Access
3291,"The engine noise is comparable to Activa when idling. However, it appears to be very low when riding, which is good. As the engine is more powerful(125cc, 8.58hp@7000rpm), the pickup is very good. The brakes are quite ok. For better control, as per the instructions, both the front and the rear brakes have to be applied together. An optional security system is available which(if installed) will be an effective theft deterrent. Along with the optional security system, a remote-start option is also available, but I don't see much utility for that feature. The mileage is between 40-45 kmpl in the city which is comparable with Activa. The detailed specs for the vehicle can be found at https://suzukimotorcycle.co.in/access125_details.asp. Overall, I feel that Access 125 is among one of the best scooters currently available in the Indian market.",Access
3292,"The engine of access is very good it is very powerful and effective as well. The comfortability of acess is also good . It got enough space to keep any in storage box. The millage of acess is very good . It gives you good performance on the city road. Various facilities are also provided by acess 125 like charging facility, proper grip on the road .it is also available in multi color option various colors are listed below 1) red 2) blue 3)white 4) grey. The most effective color of acess is white. It looks awesome in white. The white coating on the surface of the acess makes it more beautiful . So the selling of acessis highest in the Indian market. So concluding It we can Say that acess is a good performer and we should buy suzuki acces 125",Access
3293,The engine of the new Access 125 feels really smooth as the engine now got Suzuki's SEP(Suzuki Eco Performance) technology. It is also a lighter scooter in the 125cc segment which gives it more power. It has a CVT gearbox which feels smooth making it a fun scooter. It can easily touch 90kmph.,Access
3294,The engine of the suzuki access 125 is very good.The acceleration is very good and therefore of constant impulse acceleration the suzuki access starts giving poor performance.,Access
3295,The engine of this bike is in back side so weight in back side is more because of that bike sleep and cause accidents and the tyres are also small which lead to sleep the bike and not prooer greep,Access
3296,The ergonomics on the access is identitical to its previous models.its a very good option probably the best you can get in this price segment of 65000/- and the milege is also good. The showroom mentioned milege is 62 but it gives minimum of 50kmph for me for rough riding in city and about 54 on highway.,Access
3297,The fact is that I have not been regular with service and yet it never ever winked!,Access
3298,"The features which makes this scooty wonderful and more comfortable are , it has telescopic front suspension for excellent ride quality , maintenence free battery , tubless tyres , central locking system, and unique shutter mechanism for a single control point convenience and safety . It is powerred by a 125cc air coolers , 4-stroke engine , Access 125 is enquipped with automatic transmisson for convenience in city riding condition. The automatic garebox works perfectly well for thr access while the scooty weights , just 120kg . It uses 5.6 litres fuel tank while claimed top speed is 92kmph . So if any one wants to buy a scooty then Suzuki access125 is the best choice to buy .",Access
3299,"The first thing & the biggest point that sets access ahead of activa is the mileage.Phew mine has clocked 300kms & its givin me an average of 48, & its still not run in.Compare this to activa & you surely will give activa 5 on a scale of 10.For access my rating is 9 on 10.",Access
3300,"The first thing I noticed which was different from my bike; was the seating position.  I felt that my legs had to be perched slightly higher and a little differently from my usual stance on the bike.   This difference was felt just for a moment and very soon I got used to my new position.  The seat was supremely comfortable and the handlebar, which felt narrow compared to my bike, also gave me a responsive feel.",Access
3301,"The first-generation Access 125 worked well for Suzuki in terms of establishing the company's competency in the scooter segment. Given its rather uninhabited class, the competition was close between its main rival, the Honda Activa 125, and now, possibly from the new Mahindra Gusto 125.The very product design work of every competitor makes them stand out of the crowd. So we chose to ride and review the all new Suzuki Access 125 and see how really it does well on our roads.The all new Suzuki Access 125 REALLY is brand new, almost every bit from chassis to design and engine to improved torque. Suzuki has always brought noticeable difference in every new launch. They surely have understood the like minds of Indian customers. Taking this as an advantage their very new product Access 125 has given the right product by appearance.",Access
3302,"The first-generation Access 125 worked well for Suzuki in terms of establishing the company’s competency in the scooter segment. Given its rather uninhabited class, the competition was close between its main rival, the Honda Activa 125, and now, possibly from the new Mahindra Gusto 125. But Suzuki now wants to better its chances and has giving the Access 125 one serious makeover. After recently riding the new scooter around Pune, we can concur that this one certainly has the potential to head its class.",Access
3303,The front Wheel rim(Wheel disc) is getting corroded at several places. The back wheel disc is perfectly alright. Is it not a proof that one disc is of very poor quality and the other good quality?,Access
3304,The front end of the Suzuki is well weighted and aided by the telescopic suspension,Access
3305,"The front guard was attached to the front wheel dome without any bolts resulted in slipping of that front guard while driving and got struck to the back wheel cracking the front wheel dome on both sides. Entire body of the access 125 was made up of thin fiber of very poor quality. Accessories and other components are very expensive but lacks quality and standard. I recommend, if you wish to have good engine, go for access 125 but you have to allot minimum of 300 INR per month for the maintenance of its parts.",Access
3306,"The front guards(for the indicator lights and front panel) that I bought from the dealer are not designed well. They are ok if a front storage box is not needed. Otherwise, they prevent the front storage box from being installed properly.",Access
3307,The front shocks provide a reasonable amount of cushion while riding on rough roads.,Access
3308,The front suspension is a telescopic bike like suspension. The suspension,Access
3309,"The front suspension is telescopic with anti-dive mechanism, another boon.",Access
3310,The fuel consumption of the scooty is very good the comfort it gives is brilliant the reliablity on the scooty is great thats why the suzuki company launches the nwe version of suzuki access the handling and control of the scooty is not very good but still it is good the of the scooty is very awesome and nwe to get the attraction of the viewers back to the newer version its combi brake system is awesome .,Access
3311,The fuel consumption of this car is not so good it is very bad and the mileage of this scooter is also very low which is a bad problem in this scooter.,Access
3312,"The fuel efficiency is 40 in city limits and 45 highway when speed is maintained between 45 to 60 range with moderate braking. the seat is kind of flat and not having step seating unlike other scooters like activa, deo, pego and mahendra duro.",Access
3313,The fuel efficiency is not sufficient. It gives me 40 to 45 kms/ltr. which is not sufficient.,Access
3314,"The fuel efficiency isn't very good . It promises to give 55kmpl of mileage but it gives a mileage of around 43-44kmpl . For a college student like me , its very tough to manage the petrol expenses . Suspensions are good but other scooty's have better shocks.  Maintaining this bike is another hassle . Every now and then it has to be sent for servicing . My experience with this scooty was not very good and I don't recommend it to anybody .",Access
3315,The fuel tank has a better capacity (6.4 L) compared to other scooters. There is no need to remove the key from the ignition to open the boot. The fuel cap sealing is good as it did not leak after the tank was topped up.,Access
3316,The fuel tank of the scooter has a capacity is very large with compare to other automobile scooter and gives a milage of 67kmpl as the company claims.,Access
3317,The fuel tank of the scooter has a capacity of 6 litres which is good in my terms. And gives a milage of 64kmpl as the company claims.,Access
3318,"The good features which I noticed in my experience with this scooter so far was its amazing pick up, a royal mileage even in city's traffic conditions for a gearless two wheeler, which was about 40 Kms/litre given the condition that I drove in economy speeds of 30-50 km/ph, large dickey space below the seat, a pretty decent sized fuel tank, using the same key hole for opening the dickey storage, key hole guard and lastly the front suspension.",Access
3319,The gradiant ride is also very good and the engine does not give up even in the Hilly areas. The ride is very comfortable due to front hydraulic shockers.  The only concern is the mileage as it gives me Rs. 2 per kilometer but can compromise for comfortable ride.,Access
3320,The grip I got from this vehicle is mind blowing and the pick up of that vehicle has no words to explain.,Access
3321,The grip on road is good but still the grip depends on the quality of tyres.,Access
3322,The griping on the road was good but on the cemented road its sleeps alot and you cannot drive it in the muddy or barren wet land because it is vert heavy from backside.,Access
3323,"The ground clearance is decent too and will get you through most rough patches.The performance for a scooter, as mentioned earlier, is quicker and faster than the what is required. The initial burst of acceleration through the 125cc engine is good enough to excite you. Some extra fat on the Access might mean it has a smooth ride, however the stiff suspension setup makes it slightly bumpy on uneven roads. Overall the package works.",Access
3324,The handling is good and suzuki provides u wide range if colour my favorite red.,Access
3325,The handling of the scooter is very light which is not good in my terms. The scooter should have some weight to make it more handleable.,Access
3326,"The head light is a bit dampner for me, just not bright enough! Also, it dims significantly when you decelerate - becomes real uncomfortable if you are on a badly lit road.",Access
3327,The headlamp uses an ordinary 35 watt bulb. A halogen bulb would probably improve the light quality a bit. I don’t know why but most of the Access 125 scooters have the head lamp focus in such a way that we can see what is on top of the vehicle in front of us!,Access
3328,"The headlight focuses further out on the road which sometimes makes the rider feel that the headlight is not on, especially when there are other vehicles on the road with their lights on. However, this problem can be rectified by the dealer.",Access
3329,The headlight is also good and the best led display is average but when we hit it is greater than 55 kilometre per hour the lower portion of this Scooter  is vibrate and its causes unsuitable riding experience.,Access
3330,"The height of the seating is a bit higher compared to activa, so that makes a little uncomfortable for seating.",Access
3331,The heighted scooter is gud and very controlable but not always for short rider,Access
3332,The indicators pre-installed are of poor quality and you will need to change them after 2-3 months. Also the tires needs to be checked regularly.,Access
3333,"The initial key in use got so worn out that it could be easily removed in on ignition with no option to off the vehicle just in case the key fell somewhere while driving.In such condition vehicle could be started without the key as it was in on ignition.Duplicate key can be made but the magnetic shutter lock mould wont work in that case so was suggested to change the entire lock assembly.Currently using spare key which is working fine.Vehicle is not as silet as it used to be before.The fible parts keep breaking and which add to the expenses, recently changed the handle cover and front fender, the metallic fender is available only in matt finish so had to fit the fibre fender which would again crack in the future.Spare parts are often not available which take a long time to come.Thinking to sell it and buy some other model with good milege.",Access
3334,"The instrument cluster in the all new Access 125 is basic, yet stylish with a small LCD screen that shows trips, fuel level and service reminders. Suzuki has also provided a 12V power socket to charge mobile phones and other stuff. There are two hooks for shopping bags. A full face helmet along with the documents can easily be stored in the under seat space.",Access
3335,"The instrument panel is a simple unit, with a large analog speedometer and a small digital display with read outs for two trip meters, odometer, service interval and a fuel gauge. The multi-function key has ignition, steering lock and remote seat release and overall switchgear quality is quite good. The all-new Access 125 also has a small pocket up front and a couple of hooks to hang your groceries or a bag or two over the floorboard.",Access
3336,"The internal feature of access 125 - engine displacement 124cc, engine type air cooled 4 stroke, no. Of cylider 1, valves per cylinder 2 and auto transmission",Access
3337,The key to get good mileage from the bike is to allow the new bike to adapt and not ride too fast from the beginning.Accelerate to 80 kph mark only after 1st service.,Access
3338,"The large tail lamp unit with a panel of chrome above it looks unique and so do the optional alloy wheels. The Suzuki Access 125 isn’t a scooter that will garner the eyeballs similar to a Vespa but the overall styling is more appealing than its predecessor.The new Suzuki Access 125 gets a semi-digital unit with a digital display for fuel gauge, odometer, service indicator and two trip meters. The seat can be unlocked conveniently through the ignition keyhole which is a good addition.",Access
3339,"The latest access 125 is not that good in looks as per me. but the previous model of access was amazing!  it had choices of colours too. the greyish blue colour was a magnetic colour which draws everyone's attention towards it. it has a good mileage and comfortable seat. people think its heavy, looking at the fat structure but trust me it isnt I have driven it! atleast its weight is  less  than activa. though most of the  people who ride bike choose activa because its very common and people don't see what they like instead they believe the rumours and choose a bike of their choice!",Access

My father purchased it for himself but as we know everyone in the house has the right to ride. But literally I prefer walking rather than ride on thi bike. So it is quite comfortable but not up to mark. I am disappointed with this bike.,Access

The now retro looking Access 125 is very fresh and also comes with optional alloy wheels and disc brakes.The display is all new too, but comes across as a rather bland effort at bettering the competition. It is rather simplistic in design. The dominant analogue part gives clear indication of speed, the tiny digital display section reads out odometer, fuel gauge, service reminder and two trip meter figures.Suzuki has always brought noticeable difference in every new launch. They surely have understood the like minds of Indian customers.",Access

It is a light and compact scooter which makes it easy to control in traffic. The braking isn't that great as it locks up the tyre if there is too much application. Suzuki should use some combi-braking system technology which the Honda Activa have.,Access

3383,The new Suzuki Access 125 has excellent ride quality as it ironed out bumps and undulations with an authority of a third world dictator. This excellent damping endows the new scooter with the best ride quality in the segment. Our test scooter was equipped with the optional front disc brake which hasn’t been launched yet. They do a good job of shedding speeds with nice bite and progression though the rear tyre has the tendency to lock up under heavy braking. The new Suzuki Access 125 is also will swift on its toes and this can be credited to the 103kg kerb weight which makes it the lightest 125cc scooter on sale in India. The weight savings and the 12-inch dia front wheel make it an enthusiastic scooter to ride through the corners and the agile nature is fun as you squeeze your way past the traffic.,Access

The telescopic suapension have a great performance on onroad to offroad. The main big change is the front disk brake and this is a safety feature too. The mileage is sufficient according to the 125 cc power. The speedometer is really look great in night travelling and the colors are very aggressive too. When we get the throttle the scooty is actually a beast and the sound produced charge the person to make more and more throttle. People who wabt to buy a new scooty. My advice is go for this BEAST.,Access

3408,The only problem I had faced is milage . I'm using it since last 3 years and it is not at all good for long distance traveling . But you can use it in crowded cities,Access
3409,The only problem is its milage but if u need performance then u have to sacrifice this topic,Access
3410,The only problem which I found is that its mileage little less as compared to others. And if you want to go for accessories they give you discount as well. And the best part its body is made of metal and has a glossy touch. Its the vehicle which is best suited for girls and boys both.,Access

I took the vehicle to the dealer and I have got answer saying that sir, please wait until the first servicing so that all these can be fixed. I think that should be OK.",Access

The problem I had were that the sound of the indicator stopped after an year and so . The headlights aren't good at all . The need to have a bit range and brighter. Balancing is good. Can attain high speeds.,Access

The initial burst of acceleration due to good torque is good enough to maybe challenge for lead in red light GPs, which means this scooter has the go. 8.5 bhp might not seem much on paper, and they are not much on the road too, but remember the usual crowd has even less.",Access

There is no vibration or strange noice when you try to overspeed the engine noice is stable at high speed , .so suzuki access is an overall best scooter for both city and for highway journey.The best part which I cam across is the sales after service from suzuki I recieved reminder calls from suzuki service station for servicing my vehicle . and at the service station the technican are very friendly and they listen to the customer problems. They don't have attitude problem which you find at honda service station.",Access
3422,The pick up is really nasty. Even if you accelerate in full it takes ages to reach speeds of 50 kmph.,Access
3423,The pick up is very good as it is a 125 cc bike but as it is a 125 cc bike but it is also good in milege.it gives about 50-55 km per litere. Suspensions are also good.it have an anolog meter speedometer.tyres are of a good quality.it have a mobile chrager in the front of the bike. I think it is a perfect home for a family.,Access
3424,The pickup is also very good. In my opinion it is better than Activa 3g or 4g. If you are looking forward to choose between Activa for ji and Suzuki Access 125 I will suggest you to go for Suzuki Access 125 thanks. ??,Access

The tyres are good too, they are MRF Nylogrip. The headlight is a 35 watt halogen, which gives good visibility on the road.

3435,"The product is good. The Engine is most compatible with this size of body. The built quality of its body is good. The look is good. If you want to buy a scooty, buy this. Because it last longer and stronger. People complain about the mileage but in my opinion the performance it provide is worth the little more petrol it consume. And repairing its engine is one drawback. Suzuki should improve it.",Access
3436,"The quality is trust worthy, the whole body is made up of Fiber good enough, vehical is available in different colours and with some special features for new edition vehical.",Access

3439,"The rear grab-rail is a simple pick and refit from the old scooter and I would've much liked Suzuki to have given it the same treatment as the Access 125 SE, an old-school steel unit lashed in chrome and fitting to the neo-retro image that the Access is trying to project. The taillight unit spreads to almost the width of the scooter's rear section and looks appealing.",Access
3440,The rear shocks work well on rough roads and humps only when there is enough weight on the rear wheel(i.e. when another person is riding pillion).,Access
3441,"The reason why access established its market is because honda had created a huge market for automatic scooter with their Activa and Dio, but couldn't actually meet the demand.The demand was so hgh that a customer gad to wait for 6months straight.( Udupi-karnataka)",Access
3442,The reliability is a great one of this bike so one time I am going to chennai on this bike that time this is going very fast that min one car is come to my opposite is wrong then I use brake for very fast at the time to is bike is stop because this bike is give a very good road grip and very best quality Suzuki Access 125.

3450,"The scooter also have got that new fresh looks to appeal the youth and attracts a lot of eyeballs, many time people confuses it with Vespa because of the chrome headlight trim and mirrors. But now the only issue or the compromise you have to make with this scooter is quality and service. The cost cutting can be seen through the materials used in this scooter and also Suzuki's service is pathetic as compared to its competitions. So this was my review of the scooter. Please hit the like button if you agree or comment down below if you find that something is missing in this review or I am wrong at something.",Access
3451,"The scooter comes with the robust body design & panels. I AM THE PROUD OWNER OF IT TOO. The robust body design provides you a good grip in high speed just like in Vespa,It is also good for highway rides. The ultra comfort seat & the short handle design offer a ultra relaxing ride. Both the tyres are tubeless, so no worry about the punture while traveling to the long distance. It has 6 litres of fuel tank,which is really impressive. It has a boot space of 22 litres, which is enough for a helmet, some books, a jacket & a water bottle,that is really impressive & the best boot space in the scooter segment. IT IS A FULL SIZE SCOOTER. It comes with two hooks one is below the handle & another one below the seat for the grocries etc. It has a push shut lock option. It comes in two variants one is front disc & another one is Drum, but I will recommend you the drum brake because disc brakes are not reliable in scooters as scooters have the small wheel size as as result disc rapidly lockdown the front wheel while braking in result it Skids. Their also a limited edition variant of comes with a BEING HUMAN logo,Leather Seat & chrome finish rear view mirrors, but everything else is same.For the limited edition variant you have to pay approx 4000/- more which is not worth for it . It has the best in class mileage of 64km/litre. Ultra comfort riding position.A very Reliable product from Suzuki. Good handling & control.Sleek & sexy look. 3d Access 125 logo.",Access
3452,The scooter feels very good to sit with appropriate seat height and design and it maintain proper balance while riding. The good part I experience is mileage that is up to expectation. Till now it manages around 45 kmpl that is good enough for 125cc scooter. One should drive it at optimal speed to achieve this mileage performance. Overall the color combination and design graphics are really good by Suzuki and one can surely spend 5-6 thousand extra in order to get some stylish scooter when comparing to Activa or other names.  One can surely go for it without any second thought.,Access

I feel the design has really improved and now thet can easily compete with honda activa, the market leader in scooter.",Access
3476,The seat can be unlocked conveniently through the ignition keyhole which is a good addition. Also the shutter key has a one push central lock system.

The suspensions are good enough to handle such roads. Usually Diki Space is less and key hole is given on side of the vehicle but Access have the key hole at the back and enough diki space to even have a helmet and other things in it.I am getting good mileage from my Access and very happy by the decision to buy it.,Access
3552,"The vehicle was good. There is a lot of space to drive freely. The seat was so length it will be free even 2 or 3 members going on that.

First of all, the body of the respective vehicle is all fiber which gets dents very easily. The engine is also weak. I had to get it fixed after every 6 months. Not a good vehicle if you are looking for a two wheel luxury. The mileage this vehicle provides is not good. Although services provided by company is par excellence but what can you really do with all those services if the product itself is a big flop.",Access
3562,The worst vehicle in mordern times.

3570,Then comes performance: The feel when you ride this vehicle is fantastic. Engine run like butter.,Access
3571,"Then if you compare between activa and access its hard to choose as both wins in there own category, like as per my thinking, in looks activa wins by just 2 points like 51-49 and then in price both are same, activa has some new advanced features like tuff up tube and disc brake & combi brake.",Access
3572,Then in this bike the cornering is too dangerous because it wont bend much and it does not have a body balance.,Access
3573,Then on I've not given it for service regularly. I'm getting a average mileage of 40kmpl. I've used it for long distances (15km/22km) to and fro and it is good in the performance. main thing is to maintain it in the initial first year after u buy it.,Access

3580,There are few worthy points I have come to know from reading the scooter manual and would like to share them with you:,Access
3581,"There are gaps between the chrome head light surround and the actual sealed beam, ditto indicators and apron but they’re only visible up close and in nitpick mode.The overall scooter belies my styling-related apprehensions which were probably caused by the Auto Expo model being shown on stage, placing the scooter above eye level.

3587,"There are no surprises when you thumb the starter; the engine settles into a reassuring hum and the scooter pulls cleanly, accelerating without any sense of feeling strained or without any vibrations creeping in. The engine is a new one - with SEP technology or Suzuki Eco Performance, which reduces friction among the moving parts and is also said to improve fuel economy. The overall displacement remains the same at 124cc, and makes the same amount of power - 8.58bhp at 7, 000rpm. But it makes marginally more torque now - 10.2Nm at 5000rpm.",Access

I have shown to service center several times however there is no solution. Today because of this engine switch off issue, my 2.5 years kid fell down, I am very upset. It was big mistake to buy Access 125. Do not every buy Access 125 scooter, they are cheats. Safety and security is big issue. Second problem is very poor mileage of 10 km initially and now it is 20 km, service center says this happens because it is new scooter, however its has being over 6 months, still mileage is about 20 km which is really poor.",Access

I got fixed Honda Activa headlight on-off switch (cost Rs. 60/-) with slight wiring.

3597,There is no other scooter to surpass the Suzuki Access 125. Its performance is a . one and a half level because I have an Access 125 full edition matblack in my hand which I have been using for about 2 years. The performance of its suspension is what makes it so comfortable to ride on. The small problem with this scooter is that it is a bit of a risk to get started ? If you press yourself it will not start at a single stroke and the accelerator must be supported. Then Ivan was getting 60-70km mileage since the mileage was lowered and now it has come down to 55-65km which happened after 12000km. Yet I have faith that the owner will not be deceived,Access

I thought it was a defect, but the dealer said it is because of the decompression valve and its with all of them. I'm not sure if I should buy that story - because I've never heard such a sound in any other scooter before but then I verified with couple of other owners and they confirmed that they too get that sound.

3756,"This scooty makes you feel like a bike.It is very styly lookable one.And coming to its specifications -It has tube less tyres. -digital speedometer. -round mirrors. -disk brakes. -good mielage a bout 64 avg. -light system is also very very good and also too bright.Recently my friend bought it, and its running very well and we should definatly not have any problems with this bike.So my advice is to buy this scooty.Now a day all are eagerly waiting for stylish scooties.This is exactly that one which fulfil your dream",Access
3757,This scooty may give a real life average mileage of 55-60kmpl but over time the scooty quality degenerates and also the suspension stiffens and the body panels are almst paper like and if even damaged a bit need replacement because envem the slightest damage is irreversible. After a period of time the mileage drops from 55 to 35 kmpl. The scooty being very comfortable has lost a lot of points on style. Road grip isnt very bad for its segment but that doesnt mean it's very good either. There are many other bikes in the segment with bettr qualities.,Access
3758,This scooty pickup is very good and very interested in the position of breaking system.,Access
3759,"This scooty was bought by my sister 4 years ago. Still now it works very smoothly. If serviced regularly then it works very smoothly and remains as new only. If we take care of this bike there is nothing to worry, it depends on us how we use it. If we do not take care of it then also it will not go for extreme bad condition. It is a very light vehicle. It cannot go for more speed .",Access
3760,This shows how simple the handling of this bike is. Till now I had driven this for more than 600 Kms the only problem I faced till now is the buzzer of side indicator has been lost when I had drove this through very uneven road for which the show room people had replaced it free of cost.,Access

Then talking to them for longer time made me realize they were not at all professionally serious about my concern on test drive. I took the test drive but not satisfied with the ride quality and left the showroom with another disappointment. 2 days after I met my friend who recently purchased access 125. He was very happy with his scooters and forced me to once again go to showroom and git it try. I drive his access and it was very comfortable and great pich-up among all the other scooters I ever tried. At that moment my I realize my search is over and I bought Access 125 Z edition.,Access

3778,"Thought of buying an Activa.. After comparing the features of Access with Activa, I changed my mind.. and yeah all of us want value for our money :) The on Road price of Activa and Access didn’t vary much. I purchased Access for Rs. 47800 (On Road).. and shelled out Rs.400 more for minimal Accessories. I will definitely recommend this to any one who is looking for a 2 wheeler with value for money..

It gives the mileage of 45-46 km/Lt. Which I find it good for 125cc gearless scooter. The design and looks are quite sporty. This scooter really has the power, just slight raise and it vroom’s, initially the engine noise relatively audible but as you move on the road and speed increases the voices just disappear then it is the voice of wind, the scooter is really smooth on the highways, it is damn steady I have drove it a the speed of 70km/hour and it runs as smoothly as makkhan, no vibrations no noise. This is the maximum speed the scooter is not able to cross 70.",Access

The primary reason I can attribute to it's huge sales is HERD MENTALITY! Most people think that since it sells vastly, it is a superior product but in reality it isn't! There is also the resale value which is a factor. But the Activa's superior resale value is the result of this very herd mentality! Personally, I say the Access is miles ahead in every department compared to the Activa. It's only on the availability of service network, Honda is ahead of Suzuki but I see this changing as I have seen an increment in Suzuki service centres of late.",Access

At Rs 53, 887 ( ex-showroom Delhi) for the base model, it's also a couple of grand cheaper than the Honda Activa 125.

So for bother free begin it beats Honda Activa contrasted showroom with showroom while genuine beginning may vary however despite everything I feel Suzuki get to scores here. Next clearly was the fumes note and increasing speed. I had my apprehensiveness as to will opening the throttle slow down the bike like Honda Activa(happens in frosty begin) however here again it scored. After warm up I went for a test drive and the fumes note is pretty interesting(more profundity) then activa in certainty its like Honda Eterno!

3900,Well I have been using this scooter for almost 3 years now and I think that this product is not worth of price.Suzuki Access 125 has 125cc engine whichgive it more pickup then average to this scooter.Since I have been using this product for quite a long time I can assure you that after doing it service regularly does not increase it average at all.Actually it give the average of 37-43 per litre which moderate at this price range.The biggest problem with this scooter is its body which neither stell or aluminiun rather it is made of some sort of plastic material.I refer you to not buy this scooter rather you can buy any other at this range.As your safety comes first,Access
3901,Well I wrote my opinions on it and you should choose the scooter depending on your needs and also which you love from your side.No matter how this review is.,Access
3902,"Well after months of speculation & a lot of confrontation with my wife, who incidentally is or I should say was a big big fan of Activa, I finally bought Access.And boys yeps I made the correct choice.",Access
3903,Well my review is based on one ride of this scooter. In my clge me and my friends decided to take this on rent as it was available for a cheap and affordable price. So we decided to take this non gear bike. But to my surprise it didn't worked out well foe us. It is not that powerful and not for hilly areas. The tires are two small and vehicle running on high speed start to go out of control. The fuel consumption is ok and provides good mileage in comparison to other. The comfort is less as compared to activa. The vehicle is reliable in the city area only in the Hilly area the performance decreases at high rate. The looks dont matter what's important is its performance which it fails to deliver on longer distance journeys whereas its opponent activa does its job easily and more comfortably. So to be honest I wont recommend this even after its services are good but still don't go for it.,Access
3904,"Well takin bout height & the ground clearance access is taller & broader too, again not a shame for guys as this is meant for family riding.",Access
3905,"Well trust me, when u drive it, you wont leave it soon. You will just love to drive it more n more n more. I dont say Activa is bad, not at all otherwise you wouldn't have seen 90% of activa's on the road, It's just I like being unique so went for this and its not at all bad man, nowhere u can say its bad.

Have tried all the mopeds but compared to dio or activa, access is the tough of the toughest mopeds I say. Have spent almost 50k for it but for my mistake. Accidents! Thought of selling it but I love is soooooooooooooooooooo much that cant sell it no ways! . 125cc and the performance, the pickup is mind blowing. None of the mopeds gives such a performance. Yes mileage is a bit less but the power is also high accordingly. I have a black access. 9 years successfully running. The petrol tank should have been outside. This is a feedback. That's all for it",Access
3909,"What I did miss was the snap and zing of the older Access. Suzuki says the transmission is all-new – as is the engine – and I suspect that the extra torque and a more linear power spread allows slightly higher gearing which feels good to use but robs the new Access 125 of that surge that I so loved last time around. Be that as it may, it is hard to ignore the maturity and ease of use. In fact, this restraint shows in the dynamics as well.",Access
3910,"What I don't like about access is it's mileage. You will get near about 25-30 kms of mileage (hence, in 1 litre of petrol, scooter will take you 30 kms) which is not that great.",Access

3963,"With regards to the bike advertise in India, all bikes have serenely settled at the 110cc, 8bhp check. They thought Indians truly din't require an all the more intense bike. A couple of years prior, in the event that you required something more intense than the Activa, your exclusive choice was a Suzuki Access or a Vespa, which was madly costly. Goodness, there was the Mahindra Duro as well, which was fairly unprecedented and didn't get on. Indeed, even today, the rundown is as yet constrained, with the main new augmentations being the Activa 125 propelled in 2015 and the Swish, which was propelled in 2012. Since the 125cc choices were constrained when it was propelled, the Suzuki Access got a ton of consideration from individuals who needed the simplicity of a bike yet required something more usable than the 110cc bikes. The looks of the Access were not all that much, and shape a few edges, it looked like Suzuki had replicated the market pioneer, Activa. There were some huge changes however, as far as highlights. The seat on the Access was a level one instead of the bi-level seat on the Hondas. The Suzuki had the capacity to open the seat from the start reassure itself. Going to the ride and dealing with, the Access felt more steady than most different bikes owing fundamentally to the somewhat higher weight and the more drawn out wheelbase. The front end was all around weighted and helped by the adjustable suspension, taking care of was exceptionally steady and certainty motivating. It wasn't precisely extravagant yet on state streets it felt agreeable. Many individuals guarantee that the pickup is terrible. When I rode it, I understood that the equipping is not quite the same as Honda bikes so while it doesn't take off from a stop, the midrange and best end is extremely solid. I rode the Access broadly in Goa for thee days and I could joyfully journey at 70 throughout the day. On the off chance that pushed, it could touch a best speed of 90+ which was amazing and the Access felt stable at those paces. Brakes were great as well, however crisis braking would in any case require a considerable amount of exertion and would agitate the bicycle. There was adequate power accessible at all velocities, very not at all like the 110cc bikes which felt like underpowered after 60kph. The motor was more harsh contrasted with Hondas and the fumes note was somewhat reckless. I can state this as the bicycle which I leased was a generally new bicycle with just 6000kms on the odo. I dealt with a FE of 35kpl with two individuals on load up and a 80% thruway riding while at the same time keeping up speeds over 70kph for more often than not. I'd say that is truly useful for a 125cc bike, I claimed a Yamaha Gladiator 125 which returned me a normal FE of 40kmpl on thruways, so being a programmed, this FE wasn't awful in any way.",Access

The 125 cc engine is of this bike is very powerfull in terms of pick up of the bike and speed. The noise of the silencer is minimum as compared with the other two wheelers. The design and looks of the bike is also great. The bike easy to handle and lightweight. There is adiquate space under the seat to keep helmat or other accessories. Overall the bike is best. But the fiber body can be a disadvantage. Otherwise the suzuki access 125 deserves full five stars. It is a Tough competition to the other non gear bikes in its category. Milage is best compared to others.",Access

4352,the new suzuki moped comes with 125 cc engine which is sufficient for double ride,Access
4353,"the one thing that I like the most about access is her looks. she is one of the best looking scooters in india. the second thing is the low speed torque it has, this helps speed up from standing without too much effort. if I remember correctly it has feature called xtra torque performance which helps.it gives me a mileage of around 38km/l to 43 km/l which is not bad I think. I have completed around 8 servicing so far. there is one issue with the servicing schedule though, they are only valid if you service on the given duration otherwise you loose free servicing. it has a big enough boot which can hold your helmet inside.",Access
4354,the pickup of access is excellent. In matter of seconeds you will be from 0 to 60.,Access

I thought he is trying to make money so I did not give importance to his words, one more thing he told me that I should regularly check the engine oil after one week as this bike as starting ingesting engine oil in very high amount.

The vehicle also has a number of useful Equipment like charging point[one of the most important equipment nowadays]. there's also a front pocket in which you can keep anything. It also has a LED display which is appreciable. It provides a mileage of 64kmpl. Overall the vehicle has the value for money.",Access
4369,their is no external fuel filling so I am not suggest to any one to buy this Suzuki Access 125.,Access
4370,their is no much change in the recent version as compared to the previous one only new color is available none else.,Access
4371,then it would be better that I would have booked activa or dio...atleast I would have got the bike on time...any ways now,Access

4399,to home from office on the previous night. That may have caused the issue.,Access
4400,to my surprise milage dropped from 41 to 35(totally frustated),Access
4401,to ride with this Suzuki Access is some expensive to others because mileage is not so good in starting it gives the meilege of 46-48 kmpl but after 8-10 months meilage is goes down then it gives the mileage only 35-36 kmpl only some time 40 kmpl.,Access

Positive - mileage, comfort, smooth and sports bike feeling Negative - not sports bike performance although.",Gixxer
1,"Worth the price. Good sporty looking. The position is not much aggressive but good enough. I used this bike for daily commuting and sometimes for long rides., I don't feel any back problem. even if I ride continuously for 120-150 kms (without stop).But the problem is the pillion comfort which is not good.  In continuous ride the engine has heating issues. The main negative thing is gear shifting. You have to lubricate the gear for every ride. Please don't try to ride this bike without shoes or wearing flip-flops especially in city traffic..Cons : 1.Gear shifting is too hard2.Little heating issues in long rides (not much noticeable but it's heating up in continuous ride)3.Pillion comfort not much great (but trust me it's better than R15 v3 , KTM  Duke )4.Need some more power.Pros: 1. Price 2. Looks (sporty)3.Riding position (not much aggressive, helps for long ride)4.Millage (so much better than competitors in this segment)5.Looks stylish 6.Very good for daily commuting and short long rides 7.Worth of money.",Gixxer

4,"Don't believe in any negative reviews. To be very honest the most comfortable bike with classy look suitable both for city and long rides, mileage is around 47 km/l in city and 54 km/l on highway. I accept it that it's little underpowered but you are not going to feel it under power. Braking system is really awesome. Its worth buying if you are looking for comfortable sports bike . ",Gixxer
5,Suzuki gixxer bike has a complete comfortable bike ever Main point it's average In 150 cc segment no any other bike average is 55-58 But my gixxers average is 55-58 regularly.Than its pickup is best 0-100 in i drive on my self in only 4-4.5 second.And top speed is 125 km on narol highway road.It is best in 150 cc segment because of its average. And abs model is awesome.,Gixxer
6,"Buying expensive is great, they offered me a test ride and also well explained all tech specs. Riding was pretty easy in the city. Main advantage of this bike is it looks bulky and heavy sports bike but it feels light while riding in the city. Not a very powerful engine but doesn't lack on the torque when it needed. Servicing and maintenance can save your pockets ;) with great mileage. Pros: design and looks smooth engine suspension Cons: a bit lack of powerful engine.",Gixxer

14,Best bike for everyday use. Good mid-range torque. Fun to ride. Mileage of gixxer is 50 if you ride on between 40 to 80 kmph. After service cost is very low. High road stability is  awesome. I love the bike. Always change engine oil when the time come  and lube and clear the chain and look for tyre pressure is normal. Then this bike is giving you great millage and stability.,Gixxer
15,It was a great experience buying this bike. It's too comfortable for riding in city and in highway also. Whenever you go around the urban areas all people will give a glance at this bike for its detailed look which is really a compact design overall. If i say about the engine performance then I will directly say once and for all that this bike will give you a good budget sports bike vibe with it's good mileage. All suzuki bikes are easy to give proper servicing and maintenance in a good price. So without any tension this time saving maintenance service will give anyone a great road trip within their schedule. But I really feel as a con this bike should had have 6 speed gear box and overall this is a packed machine for all kinds of buyers.,Gixxer
16,"The bike is lowest prices and superb sports bike feel in the bike,top speed is 110 mileage city of 45 highway 55 fantastic capacity and this bike drive with smooth riding feel was  like i am riding sports bike, the pillion rider sitting is comfortable and driver long drive distance not feeling back pain.",Gixxer
17,"Firstly, being a Suzuki is tough & we are fortunate enough to get a refined engine at this 155cc category. Vehicle Dynamics are good in terms of stability & Handling. Look wise its a premium sports tourer giving a feel of big bike. Yes, it lacks power & it's a concern as being a 155cc should have 15 - 17 bhp power. A big visor is also a must to improve its aerodynamics at high speeds else its a bang on product.",Gixxer
18,I'm loving this suzuki gixxer sf bike because main thing i like its suspension. It is comfortable for me while driving. Speed also superb and maximum time i'm outing in the bike. Main thing disc brake it is not comparable to others. It works super.Its looks also like a racing bike and colour combination too good.Overall i love this bike so much.,Gixxer

20,"Value for money bike...Good mileage, great pillion comfort, rider comfort, powerful leds, refined engine, perfect build quality....No heating issues even in long rides and heavy traffic.Good muscular and sporty looks made it eye-catchy. One can definitely go for it.",Gixxer
21,Its a superb bike in at low cost .Stylish look updated electronic  and abs.  Suitable for both riding and adventure.  Love this  also one thing is important that back seat is also comfortable to seat and easy to get up . Yeah its my girl friends opinion . If you guys want to buy any racer bike this suzuki sf will definitely give you a surprise.,Gixxer
22,One of the best bike in this price range if you want an bike with sports model and with more comfort you can go with this bike blindly it is very much comfort in city rides and for long ride if your max speed is 80-100 then this bike gives its best performance if you are searching for an bike for racing then go with others this bike has less power but for other than racing this bike OP.,Gixxer
23,Best engine bike in this segment.Most important thing is it's smoothness.I ride this bike for long route too for almost 500 km in one day.Not a single issue face in my whole journey. Thanks to suzuki Only cons is that bike must have both abs.Service cost is also reasonable.This bike is totally head turner Awesome in look and easy to operate in heavy traffic too,Gixxer
24,"1.Buying experience is good 2.Riding experience is awesome too much comfortable for long drive 3.Looks is awesome superb but if we talk about  the performance, ""it's good but engine power is a less than our expectations. ""4. Servicing and maintenance is not too much high , it's under our pocket easily. 5. Pros and cons is also satisfactory In this range, this bike is one of the best bikes.",Gixxer
25,"I very happy with this bike and looks also good and comfortable and good milage 45 kmpl but in terms of performance need improvement after reaching a speed of 60 ignition sounds bad not ok in this other than everything is good, pillion seating not much comfortable need to be implemented on this also",Gixxer
26,1. Buying experience was pretty smooth.2. Riding exp: please don't quote me on this but this bike is not made for touring (obviously). It is really fun to ride motorcycle. Cornering is butter smooth. Suspension are set on stiffer side and you will feel the road pothole by pothole. For small city rides or occasional touring is fun but due to stiffer suspension and semi aggressive riding posture it will not be very comfortable ride.3. Looks: man this is definitely attention grabber. As it is not very commonly sold bike in this price segment you will rarely spot her but people just stalk the bike like some beauty queen. Performance midrange is fun. Till 100kmph. You will feel lack of power on highways.4. Service: servicing cost is average but my service center experience was not good. They barely know the stuff and misses on 90% of the stuff mentioned as per user manual service catalogue. Find good mechanic.5. Pros : fun to ride in city. Attention grabber. Good brakes. Exceptional handling. Cons: pillion's but will go missing after short ride. Engine tend to heat up in traffic and that do impact performance. Not comfortable for long ride if you want to save you butt.,Gixxer
27,Worst bike i ever seen. Its costs 1.52 but it does not worth that much of cost. While driving through wind air it doesn't go @60kmph.its very horrible while going doubles .disk breaks is not that much of 220f. In this rate you can go for 220 or royal enfiled or rs200. But mileage is good 40-43....,Gixxer
28,The bike is very comfortable and smooth. I have ride on it very bad road but still its give me the best service. And the mileage is very satisfactory which is most important to us.Seating of bike very comfortable.Weekly once l have ride on it for long ride around 300km. The looks of the bike is awesome. My dream bike.,Gixxer
29,Amazing performance. Value of money and also it's look is very hot. I am finally decided to buy doubled qualities mast then other bikes mileage is also good it have 155 cc engine 13.4 bhp power and the best thing is its maintenance is very long i think it is the best bike for me i really like it and i hope you will also like because the colour is very beautiful.,Gixxer
30,"I have owned this beast about 6 years ,i called my bike gixi , my gixi giving 45 kmpl mileage , maintenance cost around 1000 rupees for every 6 month and in 6 years there's no problem found into the engine. Next year if i have money in my hand then again i want to go for a new model of gixxer sf 154.90 cc.",Gixxer
31,"Bike is really good, very much smooth engine. Only problem is with indicators, in my bike with in a year, 2 indicators came out automatically. Fuel average of the bike is good. Fi technology works perfectly fine. Gear shift could be better. Headlight is not good for highways. You can touch 100km/h easily but after that engine makes lots of vibration.",Gixxer
32,This suzuki gixxer sf is very good looking bike i ever see in this price . Nice features and every thing in this bike is very good . only one negative point is their engine .This bike want oil cold or liquid cold engine for better experience .I personally like this bike so much. Engine quality mirrors tyres seating comfort are nice .,Gixxer
33,"Engine doesn't rev high (max 8000rpm) which is not good for a sports bike . Feels low powered on highway .Lack of 6th gear is a big disadvantage . Low performance for a sports bike. Front look is quite out dated , you will feel big wind blast . I suggest you to go for gixxer (without fairing) because it is 6 kg lighter ,looks are also good , and it is very good for daily commute and highway. Think practically while you buy this bike .",Gixxer
34,"This bike is awesome look. Perfect riding full money covers when buy this bike. Everything is good. No any doubt in this bike when i drive this bike, i feel awesome.  Low price and bike look like racing bike. But this bike not for racing and long rout. Just for daily uses.. If you need for long rout then suzuki gixxer sf 250 is perfect bike.",Gixxer
35,The bike good for the bs4 price not good price for bs6. I think it's high and performance is good enough and comfortable is well as compared to other full faring bikes the problem is always noise coming in front disc while braking and front suspension spring noise is coming and while you cruse at high speed the bike engine sounds like much tension and handle bar wobbling at higher speed other than the bike good for tour and daily ride and mileage is normal 40-45kmpl sometimes rarely it gives 38kmpl not always but claim mileage is 50-55kmpl.,Gixxer
36,"At first, i had an idea of buying a r15, as it is good in performance. Basically, i love faired bikes. When i come to know that it gives a back & wrist pain when we ride the bike more than 30km & it is very hard for Indian ladies to sit in pillion seat as they mostly wear saree. Hence i decided to buy a commuter bike with good mileage, comfort, handling and with good looks, which should be a faired bike at a reasonable price. At the end, suzuki's gixxer sf satisfied all my requirements. Hence i took delivery of the gixxer sf motogp edition on november 6 (writing this review on november 17[11 days experience]). I didn't even completed my first service, i completed 350 km in my bike. I just love this bike, it is good in handling while riding in traffic in cities, for me it is giving a mileage of 45km in city. A guy whom i known too owns the bs4 model of this bike. He said that it will give a mileage of 50 to 55 km on cities & 60+ kms on highway after first service. Even though it just have a air filter, it never gives much heat as it has a jet cooling technology. By the way, braking is awesome. It has just a single channel abs, i think its enough for a 155cc bike. Motogp colour of this bike is eye-catchy one. While i ride the bike on the street or city or my college, everyone at least give a look or stare at my bike for few seconds. This bike is a fun to ride bike, if you ride without pillion mostly. Pillion seat comfort is good, we can adjust. This bike gives a comfortable seating position. The seat is nor aggressive neither up straight, it give little bit leaning straight position, which is really comfortable. It has 9 led in front, but it has only halogen indicates. Can easily a reach a top speed of 128 & 133 if you hardly rev it. The instrumental console has all the needy features like gear indicator, trip meter, clock, fuel indicator, speedometer, rpm indicator, etc. You can set your warning limit for rpm. The smooth sound of the bike is like riding a car. In cars you won't hear much sound of the engine, the sound will be smooth to hear. This bike is also rides smooth & also smooth while riding in sudden grooves on road. The mirror of the bike is wide, there are more chances of breaking your mirror on traffics, but still you can fold your mirrors in non-needy places. The tyres never skid even in rainy days. I just have 11 days experience but this is rainy season here. You can solidly cruise at 90 to 100kmph. There are very minimal vibrations until 120kmph. No other bike has this much little vibrations under 1.5 lakh segment. The on-road price of this bike is 149k, which is little expensive for this bike. But i bought this bike for 144k in a offer. They should have given a big visor, when we cross 100kmph, we may feel a heavy amount of air pushing us backward, but you can change the visor with after market parts available on online. If you need a more good look, you can add the winglet of r15 in the front of the bike. Totally it is excellent bike. You will never regret after buying it. Always wear riding gears & have a safe ride, cheers!",Gixxer
37,"This is a good bike.Its good and comfortable to ride on it.It has a stunning design and is very attractive.It is a fully faired motorcycle.It gives us enough power when we ride.Vibrations are less when compared to the older version.As a safety feature it has Single-Channel ABS as standard and has a 155cc Fuel Injected(FI)-Engine which is Air-Cooled.Compared with the old model it has an increased seat height (795mm)which is a bit disappointed for shorter riders.They didn't put Dual-Channel ABS as the R15-V3 has it.It gives a good mileage around 40-45Km/L.Overall it is a good bike.It has a good price of Rs1.1 lakhs(showroom) and has a good value for money. If you are a beginner and is planning to take a new bike,I recommend you to buy this.",Gixxer
38,My dream bike.Totally loved the experience of buying from booking to delivery. Suzuki dealership in my city was very co operative.The bike is awesome & people just stare at the bike asking for info .I personally love the silver metallic colour & got it at 1.35 lakh bs4. It's totally vfm while i think the bs6 gets a price bump due to its appeal.Suzuki has done a great job with this bike .Love gixxer sf.,Gixxer
39,"Awesome bike ever,  best for long rides, Compere with r15  gixxer is super for long ride, full comfortable ride, riding position is superb, one day I ride 770 kms Puttur to Sirsi and return to Sirsi to Puttur, Gixxer SF no vibrations no engine problems continuously I ride 388km its awesome journey and its maintenance is very easy and best and other 155 segment bikes like Pulsar r15, apache and etc are give 38 to 45 mileage but gixxer sf is giving 50 to 52 mileage in highway city limits its give 46 to 48.Gixxer sf look is awesome and I love suzuki gixxer service center In sirsi name is KELLA SUZUKI SIRSI Awesome experience with dealer and there service, you want look, mileage maintenance, free comfortable long rides you can go for Gixxer sf, its best pocket friendly fuel eficiant bike.",Gixxer
40,"1.Buying experience is good. Due to less service centre you will the major issue.2. Riding experience is not good low pick up when you rev the you will feel that engine is stressed.3. Look is wonderful. Performance is bad. 4. Service average Maintenance is high material quality is bad.5. Pros - full faring bike, look very good, mileage is good. Cons- poor engine, material quality used is low. Poor pick up, price is very high according to bike quality and performance.",Gixxer
41,"This bike has the following things better than its rivals full fairing and mileageAnd that's it.the rtr 200 has slipper clutch, dual abs, better instrument console with tons of features and gtt techNs200 has amazing top endThis bike costing 1.60 lakh in Bangalore really is overrated and overpriced with people also complaining about very hard gear shifts Really ask yourself how it will be if a ns200 or rtr200 that costs lesser overtakes and i am pretty sure this bike will never catch up.There is only so much that you can do with good looks, bike looks stunning but lacks performance, go for ns or rtr 200 or the 160's, r15 if you've got the budget.",Gixxer
42,It's a very good bike Performance is superb Very smooth bike Reliable. No vibration even in high rpms. Throttle response is superb in every gears But What i don't like about my bike is Ground clearance it scrapes in every speedbraker &the headlight power is very low & the gearshift is very hard from the day i brought Other than that the bike is superb.,Gixxer
43,"Nice bike rating 5/51 suzuki gixxer sf 155cc i'm using last 3 year 2  top speed 125km3 looks super blue motogp version nice4 maintenance  good 2500km. For beginners this bike good it, you feel very comfortable then other sports bike. There is no vibration tubeless tyre ,both front and rear, battery condition  good totally  this bike for choose.",Gixxer
44,Price wise its good as there competitor in this price range but its better to go for r14. Service by all the showroom is pathetic...It doesn't have enough power. Suzuki should work on there after sales service.   Its painful...Plus parts are not available easily..Mirror of bike is most ugly looking thing. I installed after market rear view mirrors.,Gixxer
45,Bike is Very Smooth Price is Little bit high but you will satisfied with that bike. Mileage is around 48-49 in city and 50-52 highway overall good package. power is enough not good but okay for daily commute. service cost also low. And refined engine gives you positivity while riding bike handling and cornering is top notch.. Tyre are also best and provides superb road grip I'm riding from one month and no issue I faced from it. its very value for money.,Gixxer
46,"Hi, I am using sf bs4 model black. I am using from 2 years overall bike is good regarding speed going upon 125 and lights are good and horn sound is less better to change to pulsar horn and if you want to keep safety rods I won't work like yamaha brakes are not good and if possible suzuki should provide dual channel abs for better grip and mileage. it's giving 40 most sports bike won't give but in terms of mileage good for 1st year brakes will be good but from second year we need to change the disc except brakes all are good. Maintenance will be around 800- 1500. Riding experience will good but suzuki should change visor to large when ever we go to highway it would be problem with visor.",Gixxer
47,I am using this since may 2015 and crossed 100000 km. So far I didn't face any engine issues or any major issues. Only major problem I got was that my rear suspension had broken at 80000 km. After that there was no problem until now. But the mileage they have mentioned in the comment list was not correct. It gives only 35 to 38 km in traffic and 40 km on highways.,Gixxer
48,"I purchased this bike few months ago. Still now I am not facing any major issues but in my opinion some more features should be available in this bike like-side stand engine cut off, double indicators, frame slider installation option, usb charging port etc. but still it's offer you much, you can definitely buy this machine, if you are searching for a sports bike with good sitting position and more comfortable this bike is for you. Go for it",Gixxer
49,"Amazing bike for bike lovers. You guys enjoy to ride, a must buy. Test it out if interested, then find out why I'm recommending you. But there was a problem. When I bought this it was time of  BS4 to BS6. At that time the shop from where I bought this Gixxer was closed and I didn't have the paper for it.. When I insisted they told me that if you do something then do it. we won't give you the paper..Then after some time the shop closed down.. Now I ride it without the number plate.. but love this bike, it's my love. I name it Sandy. just sharing my experience. thank u team Gixxer bike service.",Gixxer
50,This bike looks like very good but the plastics quality should be much better. Power should be higher it's too less for its looks It looks very powerful bike it's not. Acceleration is leaner not punchy.Top end and low end performance is very bad and gear shifting is too hard Pillion comfort good for short riding Mileage is good if you r driving under 60kmphr but if you driving 80 up mileage is so bad.,Gixxer

I didn't feel any vibration at all during my ride. You feel comfortable while riding. Style is more sporty as compare to old model. Specially i like the gear position, clip-on handle bar and split seat. Suzuki all bike come under low maintenance cost category if service your bike on time.Pros : best bike at this segment and to many other pros as mentioned above.Cons: suzuki spare part is not available in aftermarket. For small part also you have to go to the showroom.",Gixxer

58,"1.Buying experience- It was good but the guys who are working in suzuki dealers are not that much experienced...so customers are facing servicing problems.2. Riding experience- if you want power then go for pulsar..this bike is stylish and attractive..power is okay time like yamaha fz. you want people's attention buy this bike.riding more than 80km/h is not that much good..3.Look and performance- look is fantastic...best stylish 150c bike.. performance is okay..sound is good... don't drive above 100km/h4.servicing and maintenance- This is the most important this for a suzuki motorcycle owner..now a days most of the mechanics working in suzuki are local and they don't know anything...They can destroy your bike..so do servicing at a known,good, popular suzuki mechanics... performance is good but  price is little bit high..but its better that fz. breaking is good...bike don't skid...rear brake is ok. i am getting mileage between 45-50km/l5. Pros- very stylish and attractive bike..log notice karenge tumhe...mileage is very good.. sitting posture is so good...you won't have pain...80km/h speed is bread and butter for this bike.6.cons-bike is overpriced around 8k..you will feel lack of power somehow.... after 100km/h the bike is waste...suzuki should focus on more stickers... there's no fuel mileage on the digital console..",Gixxer
59,"Awesome sports bike. Pros:Comfortable riding position - it is between normal commuter bike position and sports bike position good for taller riders, great mileage around 45-50km as they claimed. Attractive look except the front styling. Moderately priced - 1.31l is quite costly for a 150cc sports bike Cons:No abs in the rear disc. Fuel indicator not accurate. No ladies foot rest.",Gixxer
60,Its been 3 years when i purchased suzuki gixxer sf fi over other bikes such as avenger. It is a very good bike most imp thing is it is a sports tourer i have completed 13000 kms on it and no problems are faced by me. Just service it on time  and keep chain in good condition you can take it to ladakh also.,Gixxer
61,"The bike is amazing. riding posture is good. I have taken Test Ride of New Gixxer SF (2019).It is more stable on road compare to older gixxer SF, Because of Clip on bars. and power delivery is massive good. and it is look more aggressive than older one, with 10 units of LED headlamp, braking is much smoother than older one.It has Single channel ABS but it should have Dual Channel ABS.",Gixxer
62,"If you compromise a little bit of power so definitely go for that bike still this bike goes up to 130 kmph.. Millege is one of the biggest turning points get around 45 to 50 easily 1. Excellent refinement, 2. Comfortable riding posture, 3. Looks are great or fit & finish is very good.. 4. Headlight best in the segment..In the end, I'm fully satisfied with this bike..",Gixxer
63,"Suzuki bikes are worst, except scooters. Gixxar is a under powered bike and mileage will decrease after a while. And maintenance is ok, but spare parts are little expensive and hard to find.155cc bike have at least 14 to 15 hpBut it gets 13hp. And mileage will get 48kmpl at starting after 2 months or 4 months it give around 40, so worst bike ever. The thing to love about this bike is the tyres and just the looks",Gixxer
64,"1. Got the bike 2 days back and the purchasing process was smooth. 2. It's doesn't feel like 155 cc engine. It will feel somewhat like a 200 cc bike. The engine is very much refined and vibration free. It accelerates smoothly and is very stable at a higher speed. 3. Now about looks, simply the best in its segment as it feels like a bigger bike and much stylish as compared to the older variant.4. The only cons i felt is about the pillion seating comfort. The pillion seat is a bit hard and not easily reachable. I'm not complaining about it, but it could have been better.",Gixxer
65,"First i will start with my buying experience.Early i was going for royal enfield classic 350 black(both bikes are of different segment) and booked it by paying 5k to the showroom. And after 2 days suzuki launched the gixxer, I went to the showroom and saw the bike and i fell in love with its looks and style. Its completely different from the previous model. I asked them for a test ride but at that time they didn't have the test ride vehicle and said to wait for couple of days. After some days they called me for taking test ride and after taking the test ride i just went to RE showroom and cancelled my RE booking and booked the the gixxer 155. Suzuki showroom guys are very helpful in completing the process.Riding experience/looks/performance :Bike feels very planted and stable on roads. First thing you will notice when you take it outside is that people will stare at you and your bike,its eye catchy and will ask you kitne ki ai bhai. Road presence is just awesome. I feel that Seats are little hard but again you can add cushion to you seat cover to make it comfortable. Seating position is relaxed not too much sporty like r15. Breaks are good. I can't say much about the performance as i purchased it 5 days back so i will update you guys after the first service. Problems i am facing :1.Downshift is not proper. Every time I have to release clutch and press it again to downshift the gear. If I am in 5th gear and want to come to 2nd gear then press clutch Downshift one gear the release clutch and press it gain and the again Downshift... Like this i come to 2nd gear.. 2. Engine voice is changed after 60km continues ride ( can't say what happened before 1st service) but yes there is some sound from engine after it heats up. 3.  voice from abs motor. Its annoying. ktrrr ktrrr sound... To check it, apply main stand, switch on the ignition, rotate front wheel and apply front brakes hard. You will get to know what kind of sound i am talking about. Suggestion:Don't ride your bike above 4500rpm for first 800km.",Gixxer
66,"Bike's look is like a sporty type, or is it easy to make it as easy as it is, it is a great suspension that has long been a long way for me to travel it has a head light and its tail lamps are very popular. I have liked it personally, which is a reflection of which is wonderful. I enjoyed playing this bike.",Gixxer
67,Very good bike for daily commute mileage is very good I am getting mileage of 55km/l engine is so refined and maintenance cost is so low there are some minor disadvantages first visor is so bad and destroy the look of the bike and the second pillion seat is not comfortable and the bike is very underrated as it comes at a low price point.,Gixxer
68,i think this is one of the best design from suzuki for a 150 cc segment next to V3 from Yamaha.The fairing looks good and provides a sporty look with the clip on handlebars.Mechanical Specs can be improved 14 bhp for a bike of Rs.1.10 lakhs ex showroom is little bit higher with the air cooled engine in it.Suzuki should have made improvements in this section.In other terms it is a good daily commute with a sporty look and a economic mileage.,Gixxer
69,"Best bike in 150cc i have ever seen it is a best sporty looking bike and also the performance is very good, pick up and acceleration is very good and also it had slipper clutch, its free to reduce gear, no struggle on changing gears and the main thing to say about is the vva technology by this vva u will get good mileage on higher speed also it will boost up your engine twice as your engine speed.",Gixxer
70,The new  gixxer sf 155 is an amazing bike  which offered in a good price it consist of many features it have an155 single cylinder 2 valve air cooled engine with double disc brake consist of single channel  which give us mileage around 50 km/l which is perfectly suitable for our daily uses we can evan use it for over weakened rides.,Gixxer
71,This bike top model is costing 1.3 lac on road which is good we don't have any problem with it but if Suzuki is increasing price like this they should Upgrade the bike too.if I'm not wrong this is same Gixxer 13.9/14 bhp which is not expectable this bike is at least 16-17. bhp.power is disappointed me .my review Look-4.8/5                   Performance-5/5                   comfort -3.5/5                  Value for Money-0.5/5Go for Pulsar NS-200.,Gixxer
72,"This is a good bike.Its good and comfortable to ride on it.It has a stunning design and is very attractive.It is a fully faired motorcycle.It gives us enough power when we ride.Vibrations are less when compared to the older version.As a safety feature it has Single-Channel ABS as standard and has a 155cc Fuel Injected(FI)-Engine which is Air-Cooled.Compared with the old model it has an increased seat height (795mm)which is a bit disappointed for shorter riders.They didn't put Dual-Channel ABS as the R15-V3 has it.It gives a good mileage around 40-45Km/L.Overall it is a good bike.It has a good price of Rs1.1 lakhs(showroom) and has a good value for money.If you are a beginner and is planning to take a new bike,I recommend you to buy this.",Gixxer
73,This bike is awesome. Older gixxer sf next gen like 2.0.This is really good. Looks are different.The real sport machine . Comfortable seats.Luxurious rides.Night lights are clear powerful engines from capacity are awesome and its is beautiful bike to handsome guys .Super cool awesome bike. Go for it.,Gixxer
74,This a good and comfortable and stylish bike... Every youth have to try it. And breaking is also good... I like it very much... Hope every one who will ride this bike he will be happy for everything... My personal opinion is it's rock... I will go for 250 next time and the moto gp edition is amazing.,Gixxer
75,"It was gifted by me on my 26th birthday last year. So i have been using it almost 5 months. I mostly used for office purpose daily in city. But i have also completed 370 km in 2 days. In highway you feel less power but very comfortable, no problem found till now. In city ride it's awesome. Its a beast. Its gives me 45-50 km/l in city & in highway 52-55 km/l. But seriously it's fun to ride bike & it's look also gorgeous. Most of the people of the road will stair you when you will pass them. Very very refine & smooth engine ,no vibration till 110 km/r after that low vibration occurs. I stretched my gixxer till 127 km/r.",Gixxer
76,"My buying experience was too good ,i bought it from my home town Ranchi, me and my friends are enjoying this bike and riding is also good but not for log drive , looks and performance is good enough , servicing is also nice in Ranchi service centre. Pros - good price , good looks , good performanceCons - not for long drive , high cost maintenance.",Gixxer
77,"I have no bike. I had ridden my friend's bike, its comfortable.I want to purchase this bike because its better than others. It's mileage is very good also design is very well.Abs in this bike is best for secure riding.Due to this reason i love to buy suzuki gixxer sf. And i like its black colour. So i give 5 rating star.",Gixxer
78,"Both gixxer sf 155/250 is so underrated. I own a gixxer sf 155 and have ridden about 1500 km so far, this is what I felt about this bike. Quality: The build quality is pretty good, aerodynamics are at their best, the headlights are the best in the segment you won’t need custom lights, provides excellent reach and visibility even in pitch dark conditions.Engine:Performance is pretty average. Low-end punch is not there, top-end lags but mid-range performance is good. It’s not a peppy engine it’s more like a refined smooth engine. I did a top speed of 124, with a pillion 119. Seating comfort and handling:The seating posture is brilliant because it’s not too sporty, not upright, it’s well set. Pillion comfort is poor because the pillion seat is a bit taller set and it’s hard(caused butt aches). Handling is top-notch in this bike. Cornering abilities are decent.Mileage:(getting a mileage is subjective)City:40-47 (my avg:44)Highway:45-52 (my avg:49)Braking:The brakes are so good, the single-channel abs do their job pretty well. The rear brake is decent.Cons:•	it’s a bit expensive for what it offers. Lacks power (13.6ps only).•	 misses both sides stand indicator and sensor. •	pillion comfort is poor. The gearbox is a bit hard (should wear shoes or loafers instead of chappals).•	 visor is way too small(i changed mine in the aftermarket).Slight heating in heavy traffic conditions. •	resale value is lower than other bikes in this segment.Pros:•	looks stunning absolutely eye-catchy. •	quality levels are pretty good (never faced oil leak, sound from the fairing and other parts).•	the engine is butter smooth.•	great fuel efficiency. (always returns me a 45km per litre)•	handling is so good. Provides so much comfort for the rider(not for the pillion).•	flicking around traffic, taking a u-turn, and cruising at 70-85 km on highways were not a problem on this bike.•	aerodynamics is impressive (even though there are slight heating issues, it cools down very well by sucking the air from the gaps between fairing and sending it through over the engine). •	headlight looks cool and also has a widespread and provides excellent visibility(even at pitch dark).Verdict (my experience)I wanted a motorcycle under 1.5 lakhs. I don’t want to go over 160 cc because I wanted a good mileage. I wanted a bike that offers a decent performance with good build quality.These are the bikes in the budget that i considered and took a test drive and this is what i felt: 1.	Hero Xtreme 160 2.	Pulsar ns 160 3.	Apache 160 4v4.	 Suzuki gixxer sf  Hero xtreme 160 is the cost lot lesser out of the 4 I mentioned by a big margin. Performance is good. All led setup is eye-catchy. Quality is not good. The seat setup is poor and the pillion seat is the worst. My friends suggested not to buy this because it might get some issues in the future.Ns160 is a beast without a doubt it offers great performance and has an oil cooler at this price point which is amazing. Ns always have poor quality parts throughout which causes oil leaks, and rattling sounds from some parts (including the tank region). It is outdated.Apache 160 4v comes with a  lot of features and has an excellent performance. I am not a fan of its look and design but apparently, it offers everything that I asked for in a 160 cc bike. I am a tall person (6 feet) the only problem i had with this bike is that apache is suited for short and average riders. The legroom near the tank is very limited so i have to fold my legs hard which makes me uncomfortable to ride in the first place.Gixxer sf surprisingly suited my character and met my expectation so i bought it.",Gixxer
79,I'd bought the bike in sept 2017 so i m using this since last two years . From that experience i will say it has fantastic looks ...Seems so stylish its mileage is also good compared with other 150 cc bikes also it got good control and speed but you will feel lagged behind when it comes to top speed it will give about 115 also it has problem of gear shifting sound that's not smooth.,Gixxer
80,"So here comes the review of the new suzuki gixxer sf 2019 model.(take some time to read if you want to buy the bike) 1. Buying experience was good. Though i had to wait for a month to get the bike as i booked it before the launch but it was worth the wait i would say.  The sales department wasn't that too good i would say.2. Riding experience - it has quite upright posture. Its a balance between the rs 200 not too raised nor too aggressive like the r15 or rc's.  Seat for the rider is good and comfortable. Pillion seat isn't that comfortable and is hard to access for ladies and short riders. 3. Performance and looks - boy oh boy it's mind blowing. You have the torque which kicks in right from 3k rpm. Linear power delivery, will not scare you like d the ktms. Its absolutely fun riding it, i never stop enjoying it while riding. Now lets come to its look. Very stylish and aggressive, it's a head turner. Very nice led lights. But only lack is a taller wind screen it was really a much required thing.4. Servicing and maintenance - ok so here comes the reason why i hate suzuki so much. Their service is pathetic. But the bike it self is very good, but you need a good service to keep the bike in a good condition. Please suzuki increase the standards of the service.5. Pros - you get good performance and style at a reasonable price. The seating posture is good for a longer ride.  Led lights are just awesome and do have a very good performance in the city (though if you are into touring and in pitch dark conditions you do need extra lights for high speed cruising).  Mileage is good which i get is around 45. Instrument console is the best in the segment is what i think.Cons - worst is the service. 0/10. Rear brakes could be a bit better. The fuel indicator isn't properly accurate, it does have some fault(not a major one though). The front suspension is a bit hard, you are going to have a hard time and over bad roads.  A taller windshield was needed.",Gixxer
81,"Gixxer sf 155 is done his job nicely, it’s a good commuter bike with good sport fairing and very attractive eye catchy.I get 50kmpl mileage normally and 55+ kmpl mileage on highway.According to price and 155 cc this is good but sometimes feel low top end performance.Suzuki needs to improve engine for sure !!",Gixxer
82,"1. Buying experience when I was planning to get this bike I had options like r15 and apache rtr 2004v . So I went to the showroom of both the tvs and yamaha . Took the test ride of both. Comfort in r15 was not as I expected it to be. On the other hand apache was comfortable but certainly not as refined as other japanese bikes. So I booked the bike without any doubt my top priority was comfort and refinement. 2. Riding experienceYou can feel a bit of vibration at the higher rpm's but you know we don't need to ride on higher rpm's on the Indian roads. It's not a deal-breaker. The riding experience was smooth, refined, and gives you sufficient power to glide through the traffic. 3. Looks of this motorcycleLooks are totally subjective and I can say I found gixxer sf 150 more eye-catchy and appealing than its rivals. Why? because it's unique in its segment you won't see people on gixxer everywhere since they are just looking for power and more torque. The headlights are mean and aggressive and yet it's comfortable to ride 4. Servicing and maintenanceIn this part, I rather say it costs a bit more as compared to our own Indian brands but it's worth every penny. And maintenance is not an everyday task if you genuinely care about your vehicle then you'll eventually take care of her no doubt that. It's easy to maintain in the end.5 . Pros : 1. It has a big muscular aggressive profile2. Gives you mileage around 40-45 in city commuting3. Refinement level is top-notch4. Unique because only practical buyers buy the gixxer sf 1505. It has a gear position indicator ( i know it's a normal thing but come on some companies still don't know how to give that) Cons : 1. It is slightly underpowered2. Switch quality needs improvement3. Gears are pretty hard and clutch too I don't know if it's only my unit but it feels hard wasn't expecting that from suzuki need a big upgrade on that4. Faced some rusting issues in the inner parts after driving 5000 kmConclusion:  if you are looking for a practical 150cc bike that is fully faired gives you a vibe of a faired motorcycle and needs the smoothness of Japanese engine then this one is for you. Just keep in mind the points that I've mentioned in my review. Thank you, ride safe",Gixxer
83,1. My first bike that's why first experience..... I can't explain 2. Very good experience after driving this bike 3. Look was awesome and dashing and performance are awesome with looks 4. Servicing not much high ok 5. Pros - everything is good Cons- 2017 i purchase suzuki gixxer sf ( f/r disc) blue but 2019 comes with more attractive looks.,Gixxer
84,"The buying experience was normal for me, I actually went to buy sf 250 but 250 was not available at that time and they said it will take 3 months time and I needed a bike urgently so had to go wid sf, riding experience is really good and comfy, it gives a hell lot of confidence in corners just need to change those tyre.Bs6 version feels really smooth just has minor vibes around 5,000 rpm, performance is great as a 155 cc has a peppy engine which is great if you do not have a power-hunger in 155 cc but you only demand comfort and a big bike feel then this is one of the best options. Pros provide great mileage if you ride it normally has the great visual appearance, I know suzuki will provide 6 gears in it so gear ratio should be increased,2nd gear is too short, 5-speed gearbox is fine in city use but gear ratio should be tweaked in each gear (stock gears 1st - 42,2nd -68,3rd-90,4th-108,5th-120+) I want this machine gears to be like (1st -49,2nd-76,3rd-96,4th-118,5th-130+).",Gixxer
85,"Mileage only 35 to 40 kmpl, bhp 14 only when using 5th gear. No good pickup. Poor front and back seating. Good for riding on highway at high speeds. Average breaking, not suitable for daily use. Looks are awesome. Only 5 gears. Need 6 gears for good speed. Led light not suitable for street riders because opposite riders can not see properly. Better to buy a scooter instead of buying a big amount bike. Because scooter can easily chase this bike on traffic roads and also scooter is giving good mileage and good pickup and no need of shifting gears up and down always.",Gixxer
86,"It was gifted by my dad on my birthday in 2021. So, it was bought in apple suzuki showroom, outer ring road, banashankari 3rd stage, Bengaluru. Talking about the riding experience, riding this from past 6-7 months have given me immense joy and i am impressed with the power of the bike. In Bengaluru city you can ride maximum up-to 40-60 km/hr. (if the road is empty and smooth). It also gives a good mileage of 40-45 km/l. All other /aspects while riding is good.I liked the sporty look of the bike, having 155cc, it is gives a good performance. I have the bike in black and it gives a separate look as compared to other colours.",Gixxer
87,Best bike in Indian market compared to any other brand bikes companyGo far it Best milage.Deep base sound.130kimi speed.A super lovely look.Super led hed light.Attractive tale backlight.Best handlebar.Comfortable pillion seat.Smooth suspension.Abs braking system.Dual disk brake.Avrage looking very sooper,Gixxer
88,Greatest 150cc for beginners.The riding quality is too much comfortableFully faired bike with an aggressive look.The built quality is very good.Mileage is also very good in the city.Power is not too much but performance is 10 out of 10.The exhaust note is very punchy.Smooth engine.And the brakes are really very nice.Only missing thing in this bike is dual abs and 6th gear.. this is available only in the single abs standard version.. but the rear brake is also very good .overall 9.5/10.,Gixxer
89,"I was a scooter rider, now after riding the gixxer sf 2019 155, the bike seems very well built, good power, impressive design, great braking. A little bit aggressive, after all its a sports bike, and a bit heavy. Very good handling , nice headlight , wonderful real lights. Good mileage with sports look. Good balance between sporty and commuter.",Gixxer
90,"I can buy for gixxer sf  model for highway crushing and daily commuting but can'd expect this much of mileage when crushing in highway exactly in 7000 rpm it will touch 100 kmpl without any  any engine stress but discomfort for pillion rider suzuki improve it spare parts or cheaper , sadly i hate engine noise and gear ratio of the bike.",Gixxer
91,"Loved the side looks of the bike, so I bought it. But it has been a very painful journey throughout. Within a year it developed abs problems, one year and a month later battery problems, and now after 2 years headlight went off(led unit). The bike was maintained very well with regular services and 0 crashes or drops. This proves that trash components are used in the manufacturing process. I will advise people against buying a suzuki motorcycle in India. Service guys know very little. They will replace everything as they don't know how to repair it. And so many problems within 2-3 years are not justified for the price you pay mentally and financially. No doubt their sales are dropping. Spend your money elsewhere if it is hard-earned for peace of mind.",Gixxer
92,It has good fuel efficiency with good mileage the engine is also good and it has 131 top speed without any coolant or ac in it so personally i liked it very much in comparing to others and it is affordable too as it is not much expensive so i'll prefer everyone to buy suzuki bikes because of the materials!,Gixxer
93,1.Buying experience -For 150 cc segment looking wise suzuki gixxer sf very attractive. This is for the reason to become choosing this bike.2.Riding experience Over all mileage was pretty good for this bike & rider sheet very comfort for long drive .Engine slidely become heat for long drive.Not comport for co driver sheet - feel pain for 40 to 50 km3. Looks & performance 1) looks: Looks  wise i give 4.5/5 but build quality in this bike very poor. There is no safety measures in this bike. 2)performance A) breaking -4.5/5B) engine noise-4.5/5C) rider comfort-4/5D) city ride-4/5E) long drive-4/5 Over all performance wise in this bike slidely good we lag in maintenance 4) servicing and maintaining 2/5 We need to check the engine oil every  2000 to 2500 km once *engine oil leakage problems not solvable *maintaining cost slidely high to be compare other motor cycles in this Segment .We need to pay the double for the bike cost. We've to very careful for bike service records there is no proper maintaining records if you not checking there is no entry put in your bike in system so please check every service your bike system records -this is yous full for engine warranty Over all. This bike was very good but suzuki lag in after sale service. The service centers not available experience persons every time the persons change & they are thinking about cost benefits only .If we place any compliant we need to change new parts only we not get solutions about that. I totally disappointed suzuki after sale service i am not satisfied their service. 5)pros and cons. Pros A) looking wise very good B) smooth engine C) good mileage Cons A) after sale service very bad B) gear very hard C) high maintenance cost D) low ground clearance E) poor build quality.,Gixxer
94,"Worst bike ever. It's been only 15 days and I'm facing lot of issues. Out of the blues, the bike doesn't even start, and had to manually walk the bike total of 5 times including today. Went to the service center and I was told that the battery is damaged. What? did the battery get damaged in 25 days? replaced battery yesterday and today also bike didn't start.  Went to the service center again and I was told that there was some wiring issue and this needs a kit replacement. And guess what, I have to pay 7000 from my own pockets. That's all happened in 15 days. Worst bike ever. Avoid at any costs. Even their service center staff is unprofessional. I badly want to get rid of this bike. Worst purchase ever of my life!",Gixxer
95,"I bought the 2019 edition of gixxer sf for 1,10,000/- rs. The bike was super comfortable to ride even a pillion comfort was amazing, and decent mileage for 2 years. But it has tremendous issues with poor wires, the clutch was replaced every 6 months, too much heating issue, every electronic part was cheap, headlight beams don't properly guide you on the dark road because beams are not falling on the road, rpm gets high automatically whenever you come back from a long ride.",Gixxer
96,"The buying experience was a very good thing, I was not believing that I am going to buy it, showroom people make it good.This is the bike where I learned how to ride,The bike has good acceleration and looks very good, lot of people look at this bike and ask which bike as very few know it.Performance is good for a 155 cc bike, Pros are looks, pickup, and efficiency.Cons side stand switch and mileage indicator not present.",Gixxer
97,Best budget-friendly sports bike. Suits for city as well as highway. Parents can easily sit in pillion seats with sarees. Good mileage. But the disadvantage lags speed sometimes and there is no 6th gear. And disadvantages Bluetooth and gps connectivity. Best for students who want to buy a sports bike. Nice finishing. I would like to add the suzuki symbol in a bold highlighted manner as Yamaha put on them.,Gixxer
98,"This is a bike you can use in local ride , long ride , touring in short everything. I tried it to day , this is awesome , handel's are in perfect position. No back pain / no wrist pain / no problems...Dual channel abs is standard so safety is no longer compromised. In short whatever suzuki is not giving i don't need that but what they are giving i am happy in this price tag....",Gixxer
99,I love to ride my bike Gixxer Sf sp. I will be happy to give 5 stars but the problem is the bike is shaking while Pick-up the bike and shift up gear 3 to 4 to 5. I told the service centre but they told me every Gixxer bike has this problem. So maybe this is a manufacturer defect. Suzuki should solve this problem. Thank you.,Gixxer
100,"The dealership experience was absolutely amazing! loved it. Riding the bike is thrill, every time you turn the key to ignition and put the bike in first gear, she's all set for take off! i peaked the bike at 130 km/h. The bike i have black  from the way the gunmetal shines to the way the red accent runs here and there, she's adorable in every way! tremendous amount of cost cutting has been done for the Indian market because our market has the most stupid mindset, in order to maintain sales, cost cutting has been done. Coming down to the servicing, it's very very economical. Including the free service coupons ( 3 services done so far).Costs roughly 800 rs only hands down. She's pretty easy to maintain, not costly at all after being a sports bike.. Parts are cheap are as well. Talking now about the pros :-- worth every single buck spent- power delivery will never bore you, be it any gear- abs is very reliable, saved my ass multiple times- lot to offer for a mere price tag of 1.6l- easy to maintain, spare parts won't burn a hole in the pocket- eye grabber, absolute chick magnet xd- ergonomic, no back pain or wrist pain, however a little adjustment of handle is required. Just a little.- tyre are wide and trustable, lean her with confidence!- average, the question of the matter, the engine on this one is amazingly refined, susuki has done it.",Gixxer
101,"Am buy this bike only seven months(13100km)the engine started too much noise and gave to service in thrissur indel suzuki manager told me you never get warranty service for this vehicle very bad experience suzuki, i will never recommend this bike for who may know.",Gixxer
102,1. Buying experience is good. They want me to be happy and make my satisfaction. 2. Riding experience is excellent 3. Details about looks- it looks great for me and it is my dream who do come true after owning this super bike.  Performance is not that bad in which pickup is little bit late or slow.  4. I don't have any experience in servicing so no ideas. 5. Pros and cons No cons in this bike rather pros for everyone who would like to buy. The advantage of this bike is like walking in the sand.,Gixxer
103,awesome bike. suzuki please focus on visor.visor is the only problem in the bike.otherwise performance okay breaks really good. fairing fittings excellent. head light is very bright while headlight in on unable to see the bike.if you want a good looking bike with good mileage suzuki is the best option.,Gixxer
104,"No doubt, bike looks awesome, clear finishing.. Best performance under in 150cc segment... Comfortable riding...For beginners, some may feel discomfort for a week then you will get used to it, you feel very comfortable then other sports bike.   There is no vibration at all.. But the problem is bike wobbles a bit at 80 to 90 kmph only when your not holding your handle bar.",Gixxer
105,I am going to buy suzuki gixxer sf on jan 2020. This bike look sporty look and moto gp edition also available and clip handled bar so its completely we get good sports bike look.And the price also comfortable. We get split seats and led head lights. And we get good mileage. We get 40 to 45 in local 45 to 50 in highways.,Gixxer
106,So i want to start with the looks of this bike. It has got a very nice bulky body with good quality fairing. The glossy black colour is my personal favourite. And riding experience of this bike is also very good as it's seats are comfortable. It has a low cost service and maintenance which makes it budget friendly .It has very good mileage around 48-50 km/l.,Gixxer
107,"Buying experience are good but riding experience are really awesome ,enjoying ride because this bike are perfect for me because current student and i have daily up down in college and coaching very comfortable with sporty look . Thank for bike wale for review and compare this bike and also thank my daddy he bought this bike.",Gixxer
108,"To start with the buying experience, the staff were very helpful and guided me to get the correct color and variant. The main usp of the 2019 suzuki gixxer sf is its aggressive styling which is both refreshingly new and purposeful. It looks sharp and so is the performance, the gixxer sf is powerful and fiel efficient but because of the likes of the apache rtr 1604v and pulsar ns200 at the same price makes it somewhat difficult. The yamaha r15 v3 which also has a 150 cc engine, is very powerful and faster than the gixxer sf. Service and maintenance will not be a problem with the gixxer sf as suzuki is known for its reliability and trust. The riding experience is not so sporty like the r15 v3 or commuter like on the apache rtr 1604v, it has a perfect balance and is one of the comfortable sports bike in the segment. Pros:• comfortable ride• great fit and finish• aggressive styling. Cons:•low performance compared to rivals• windscreen visor not really useful.",Gixxer
109,Good handling...Great performance. Smooth engine. Really value for money bike.  Great look and full led headlight gives a bright visual appearance at night. Service cost too low under 500 and change the engine at the first servicing as soon as possible. Use motul 10w40 fully synthetic engine oil after the 3rd servicing.,Gixxer
110,"Good fair looking Led head light superb. Nice mileage, No vibrations at high rpm. Many of them were saying that there is a problem in abs and noise from abs i didn't found any sound from abs so don't go with any negative go for gixxer sf 150. Finally nice bike with low price and sporty look love this. Go for it.",Gixxer
111,#buying experience i brought this bike june 18 2019. This bike is really awesome and its road presence awesome. If you want to buy a good look and a good standard bike you go with gixxer sf 2019.#riding experience i told you guys this is a segment king in riding quality #performance and looking that is also a segment king again.,Gixxer
112,"Suzuki gixxer sf is seriously a wow bike.Very good acceleration and more high range looking bike for youngster boys.Very good bike  riding experience. The new disc brake system and abs system is very comfortable to ride the bike.Suzuki gixxer sf is a good bike for daily use. As well as style is great at this price range. The seating position is very good, you won't feel tired on a long ride. Mileage is good in city road you can get 45kmpl and high road it gives 48kmpl. This bike has the best design and the body type for short rides.",Gixxer
113,This is a good looking bike for young Indian. Also it's sporty bike for a middle class boys. But when we ride it's looks a high class bike. Any one can effort. And it's super fast and smooth. I ride this 121kmph. Personally i want to suggest if you want to a budgeted sport one then u can buy.This bike have a worst point that is looking glass it's to big.,Gixxer
114,"Gixxer sf 155 is done his job nicely, it’s a good commuter bike with good sport fairing and very attractive eye catchy.I get 50kmpl mileage normally and 55+ kmpl mileage on highway.According to price and 155 cc this is good but sometimes feel low top end performance.Suzuki needs to improve engine for sure !!!",Gixxer

116,I loved its look and it is very comfortable to ride it even for a long ride i feel no problem in riding it my experience was good as an owner i prefer people to buy this bike and i appreciate the company for such a sporty bike with a fair price only problem is lack of 6th gear and dual abs which enhance the bike and it can get over its competitor like yamaha r15v3 and it is big competitor of the the suzuki gixxer sf.,Gixxer
117,This machine is very comfortable and affordable on this price segment . Riding this bike is more comfortable after a long drive there is no stress or back pain . Look and build quality is in good side plastic used and all parts are good . Performance is great for this price suzuki services are great .Pros :great machine :good quality :good performance and look. Cons :better provide liquid cooling system : missing of 6th gear.,Gixxer
118,Its amazing & superb bike in suzuki all bike but gixxer sf is more better than all segment Very good looking bike. Last month's i'm seeing this bike i am very excited to but this bike Black & silver both colour is very good but 250 is more better than 155. I ride this bike in 5 to 6 km its sitting position is very good & very comfortable.,Gixxer
119,"I haven't buy this bike, but i driven multiple times as one of my friend have it. Just love the bike handling, very smooth handling and the breaking control, As mentioned my riding experience is brilliant.Looks wise bike is superb in both the variant.

Really comfortable to ride totally much better looking design and attractive pickup engines stylish looks and very nice performance totally my rock street rider.Ultra high speed and engine speed control also looks every thing very nice.I prefer to enjoy good rides with suzuki gixxer sf.,Gixxer
121,"The gixxer sf is a very good option for riders looking for a fully faired entry level bike at a reasonable price which most of people can afford. The bike looks awesome and suzuki's sep technology is awesome. After riding for 27000 kms over a span of 4 years 8 months .. Here are some pros and cons..Pros.1. Awesome looks (especially the moto gp edition)2. Refined engine - its a suzuki 3. Throttle response is very good 4. High end torque is very consistent 5.  Gear shift indicator and clock on the console is a blessing 6.  Dual channel abs is a blessing 7. Bike reaches 100+ speeds without much effort.Cons: 1. Ground clearance is low so be careful around high rise speed bumps 2. Indicators break often, quality should improve 3. Visor is low (in 2019 model) so win blast could be an issue 4. Seat is on the stiffer side so long rides may be painful.5. Service cost is high as compared to rivals, service network needs to grow 6. Mileage is 30-33 in city conditions.Conclusion: despite some demerits, the gixxer sf is a good bike and at the price point it retails with that refined engine .. Its a very attractive overall package.",Gixxer
122,Excellent bike for daily commute and stylish in everything mostly youngster should ride the bike for showing extra impression towards others.Service and maintenance is minor in this case. Looks matter everything for this you can take according to your choice.I think if price is little bit high for the youngsters they can't afford it easily.Thank you.,Gixxer
123,"I am thinking to buys this one because,  i love suzuki. And about the bike nothing to say its gives simply Awesome....Performances...Looks..And from my opinion 3 Disadvantages1) New suzuki gixxer SF as less engine cc compare to old Gixxer engine.  update version should be increase not decrease...2) Visor should be given little bit length & the flow of air while riding the bike is coming form inside the visor..... there is no proper aerodynamic....3)  This point is from my side.,  in MotoGP Edition the colour of blue is not fully completed at the end of engine side cover its given as Black. But in 250cc MotoGP Edition its fully Blue.If this is not a big problem for you. You can buy......But for me i will definitely going to buy this one  MotoGP Edition....",Gixxer
124,"1. Buying experience is good... I don't think this price is too high... 2. Riding experience is very good according to me.... After 100km/h..It will be not good as before 80km/h3. Looks are impressive.. Eye catching design... Best in performance in this range.. 4. I don't have servicing experience bt i heard about it..... It is low maintenance bike5. Pros.... Good looking, good mileage, good colours available... Cons.... Should have some more power according to 155cc bike.... And it could be more stylish....",Gixxer
125,The look of this bike is a killer look. Engine of the bike is very refined and riding posture is great. Black colour of this bike looks great. Bhp of this bike is little bit lower but the ok for city riding and long tour. Suzuki offered latest bike in this price segment. The engine provide by suzuki is awesome. You should go for it. It was a awesome bike in 155cc.,Gixxer
126,"Ultimate bike, riding experience is great. Light weight and the handling is super. Good breaking system, acceleration is awesome. Best bike for this price. Little monster.  Too much comfortable while riding, and it will be also comfort for the back seater. Go for it, you will never regret. I never saw any negative review for this bike....I love it.",Gixxer
127,"missing for buying new version .. I buyed old version most wonderful riding experience and massive look, First I buyed Pulsar ns 160 not good experience. but this so nice1. Long Ride so Comfortable2. Power all so good3. Gear Shift Is Hard4. Abs Is so nice5. Mileage too good6. looking sportive.",Gixxer
128,Best bike under 2 lakh for daily usage and also long ride.. very comfortable to ride this bike. Bike height is so good .. everyone can drive for Gixxer bike height ... Millage also very good .. It's give you more than 45km overall milaga which is really good .. nice thing is that is bike looks very good .. it's look like 3 lakhs bikes but we can get this bike under 2 lakh with nice feature..,Gixxer
129,"Suzuki company given a super quality fully fairing bike. Last year i brought my gixxer.I tried r15 ,rs 200. Finally i like the riding position of gixxer. I loved it most.Value for money. Gixxer sf build quality excellent.Its braking system with single channel abs is fabulous.For long tour it makes me comfortable when i ride.Suzuki gixxer sf's previous version not much impressive for me.When i make 100% to purchase a bike then there were one bike in mind ,that is apache 160 4v. Later my friend informed me about suzuki gixxer new model.I so much excited when i saw its launching video. It's sparkle black colour made my crush from this particular moment.Also brought this color.",Gixxer
130,"1. There was no issues during the, purchasing of bike. The staff of showroom was too  honest, theirs complications skills are amazing.2. Mostly i used the bike in city In-spite of heavy traffic , the riding comfort are pretty good.Seat is too soft, compared to other sports bike.3. I think in series of sports bikes under 150 k, it is the most reliable.Looks are awesome, specially sparkle black colour. Performance are good. But for rough rider it is not supportive because less torque.Compare to others sport fairing bike, it is very comfortable. Pros.Amazing look, Mileage, Comfortable to ride. Led head light. Fi engine. Break. Cons: Power is little bit low Less torque, Traditional indicator.",Gixxer
131,The bike looks very good. After first service bikes became very smooth. Handling is superb. But price is high that is ok because it's look like super bike. I achieved my top speed 125km /h that is before first service after service easily push 130. Don't consider this bike as a less powered bike only paper it is 13.4 bhp in reality it is like powerful bike.,Gixxer
132,Lack of 6th gear and pillion seat have to be little more comfortable.  Must have oil cooled system. Presence of led turn signals is indeed which makes it more premium and dashing. I think it is little expensive also approx 5000 rupees. So these are the pros and cons towards this bike according to me.,Gixxer
133,"I just love gixxer sf.   the riding position is very comfortable yet sporty. Engine is very smooth.    looks is just awesome, everybody will love this bike, because it made from the same legendary hayabusa dna..The power is little bit less then before but you cant really feel it. service cost is not much high. Around 1200 -1400rs service takes. Maintenance is not much higher like ktm rc and r15. Pros: good looking, comfortable, good mileage, low maintenance, full fairing in cheap price. Cons: There is not much cons of this bike but power should be more.",Gixxer
134,"I believe you have multiple options , if your list has only Yamaha R15 consider Suzuki GXR 150 indian version. It was hard to get the Motorcycle in Trivandrum But it is worth the wait. Value for money, Better Riding position which is adjustable too, Best mileage in this segment, minimum maintenance cost and Highly attractive design. If you are opting for a bike which less on road and is eye Catchy, Go for GSXR 150 Indian version.",Gixxer
135,If you want something more than good and better sports experience in good budget and awesome experience of sports go for sf. Low maintenance Insured Would love to ride this because of posture better than any other sports bike i love this one as the variant colors i and my friends own are really awesome this makes our trip a memory.,Gixxer
136,"Very stylish and sharp looking bike, power Is enough but Suzuki should need To Increase at List 1 BHP more power. Engine is refined and smooth. fiber quality at top notch. Mileage around 50-52 Km/l In City and 55-57 highway. Overall good package but price of the bike is  little bit High.Thank You.",Gixxer
137,"I bought this bike from my home town yavatmal. Buying experience was good, dealers were cooperative and provided proper info. As they were in contact with me from before they also provided with extra accessories. Riding this bike gives awesome feel. Even if this is a 155cc bike it feels like we are riding some 180cc. Looks of the bike are killer. I own one in white colour and it looks just fab. I got many turn-heads and many people ask me about the model and price. Suzuki service centre mechanics are cooperative and provide good servicing. Talking about pros and cons, pros: 1. Looks are super, 2. Engine is much refined, 3.Good mileage(~45kmpl), 4. I personally love that exhaust sound. Cons: 1. On highways we feel absence of one more gear but fairing does its job to some extent, 2. My mom never sit on this bike because that pillion seat is not enough for ladies to sit cross position.",Gixxer
138,"Pros:Buying experience was very good,riding experience was also very good and it's looks is stylish and performance is awesome. Servicing and maintenance is also best and pocket friendly.Cons: only problem is it's chain sprocket it's required to change in between 10000kms otherwise it's the best .",Gixxer
139,"Buying experience is not so good, but the bike is very good. Riding position, handling, mileage and looks all are awesome. Performance wise it's pickup is very fast but above 100 it lacks power. Top speed is 130 km/h best in segment. In one word its comfortable with sporty looks and mileage.",Gixxer
140,This bike is value for money. The power is less but it is ignorable. Handling in cities and traffic is awesome. Comfort level is extremely good for long rides. Pillion seat is not much comfortable but it's al right. Look of this bike is amazing just like younger brother of Hayabusa. Ground clearance is also good .,Gixxer
141,"Making the decision to buy this bike wasn't very challenging, as the gixxer sf was the only trustworthy, fared commuter in the 150cc segment. I'd look at it as a beginner's bike. While i'm glad i bought the bs4 compliant which has a tad more power than it's bs6 version, it could still use a bit more horses. However, any lack is compensated by it's looks which are amazing since the facelift, and the riding position. It is so ergonomic that you barely can find a reason to complain about it. It is a full faring with clip-on handle bars and yet you get an almost completely upright riding position, which is suitable for riding without getting tired, and allows you to get off your bike without a stiff-back.The service provided by suzuki could be also rated as more than satisfactory. The folks at the centre do not just help you maintain your bike, but you can also rely on them for any accessories or advice to improve your riding performance. You could tell that these guys know what they're doing.But that's not all to buying a bike. Comparing it with it's competitive, in the price segment, it's tough to find a better bike, impossible to find a fared one. While the r15 is a good fared 150cc, it's costlier and has a notoriously aggressive riding position. In conclusion, if you're planning on buying gixxer sf, i'd definitely recommend you to put some thought and research in it, but i'd assure you that you've got plenty of green flags to purchase this bike and you would barely have any complains.",Gixxer
142,"This really amazing for daily commute. And also mileage around 45-50 kmpl i get. Sitting position fully comfort also rear seat. And long ride's also superb, mileage, and speed around i checked 130kmph. Looks are fabulous like mini hayabusa. Very comfortable price and very comfortable for family person also, light weight.. i prefer this bike 100%. Superb.  thanks you for suzuki for giving less price, good future's. Especially the abs system working fabulous. Breaking very good. Thank you.",Gixxer
143,When am buying this bike am not expecting much about this bike. I usually use bike for daily commute but i got surprised by it's performance n handling is quite amazing.I love this bike it also has seat comfort n also suitable for touring also has good fuel capacity tank. Last but not least it has good mileage too.,Gixxer
144,"My buying experience was simple, it's easy to buy in Mumbai's showroom variety of stuffs discounts and much more offers etc. So I am very happy but one thing is that they gave me small cover and half helmet and it took one month and no response from showroom so I didn't changed instead of changing I bought new one, my riding experience is good but I definitely say that Gixxer SF needs more power I feel it on highway that if they give us more torque and more high-speed than it will well and good but its not under power its perfect for new owners and according to price tag its just perfect engine that I have got and now from look wise I say its just fantastic its something new in market it has its own taste I just loved the look I have glossy black new color and other thing is servicing and maintenance so if we look service centre there are lots of service centers in Mumbai so its easy and I will  share my own service experience that I will say if you have proper knowledge than go to any of service centre or else take a friend suggestion who has knowledge about it or you will be charged extra they will say xyz reasons. Easy to maintain bike looking forward pros and cons so I will add some points gearbox is hard little bit low power and I am not happy with visor but the looks is just awesome smooth engine no vibrations comfortable to ride in traffics, comfortable to ride longer for 3-4 hours, I have ride it non stop almost 4 hours so I will say its very comfortable but I will say riding with pillion in traffics is little bit tough but it depends on riders I will say perfect bike Just Buy it.",Gixxer
145,"The buying experience was good, this bike is a beast in low and medium end, this bike is a beast, decent on top end as well, reached top speed of 130 km/h on highway, just overall good experience and is comfy for a sports bike with good mileage. I recommend buying this bike, reason, Suzuki's reliable engine and overall experience was top notch.",Gixxer
146,"i got it for 1.40lakh on road ,awesome riding no problem like back-pain very smooth you must buy this bike. It is not under-powered because it is designed for smooth riding and sexy looks so if you want a fast bike go for r15 but you  can't say this bike is under-powered, go for black color as it looks more appealing than other colors ,good luck cheers...",Gixxer
147,"Best in class, super smooth. Looks awesome. 45 km in town, 50 km on highway. Best is best. Engine is super refined. Awesome in performance. Best for daily commute & long ride. Gixxer. My gixxer is brilliant & maximum. Nothing to say, perfect in every way with beast look.",Gixxer

As compared to fantastic KTM 150cc dukes which are burning with price tag of more than rs 1 Lakh 50 thousand and even more, and Yamaha R15 and Honda CBR150 same near about rs 1, 40000 to 1, 60000.",Gixxer
46,"A great bike I bought from my own money. I learnt riding motorcycles on a Ninja 650R which I didn't own. Then I bought a Thunderbird 500(dad bought me) because I was suggested to buy it as I'm fat(102 kgs, 5'11ft). But had to sell it because of non touring(was doing my MBA). Finally I got a 155 cc bike from Suzuki with my own money this March(still a student at the time of purchase) GSX 150F or Gixxer SF. I went for it because I had 1.10 on hand so couldn't wait or didn't wait to get R15 or RC 200.(not interested in CBR 150 and RS 200) Couldn't test drive it as there were none available for test drives. So I had to make the decision my just sitting on it in the showroom. Paid cash, generated bill and other documents, filled 1 litre petrol(complimentary from Suzuki) and rode home. Bike fell on the 1st hour of my purchase as I was engaging side stand after halting in my garage and there was piece of marble on which I laid the side stand and didn't notice it was slipping. I fell and the bike fell on me.",Gixxer

I fell and the bike fell on me. The left indicator broke off and was hanging. Got up and found no damage on the fairing. Clutch lever got scratches on the rounded end. Fixed indicator with Fevikwik. Great 1st day. After this I knew nothing would happen to the fairings even if it fell. Bike fell like 3 times now. No damage on the fairings, but yes back plastic of the mirror and clutch lever's ends got scratched. I put stickers on the bike and put on LED neons, gear socket protector, throttle control engager, tank pad and a saree stand for my mother to sit on the seat sideways and voila! I have a bike that everyone turns their heads to see while I'm riding. Yes, got a seat cover too because there are cats on my neighbourhood.im very much happy with this bike.",Gixxer
48,A great bike but the material used are very cheap.so it gets scratches very easily.I think it will look old within 3 months of your purchase.stable at high speed.handling is the best.fuel efficiency is OK type.overall a good bike but Suzuki should give at least the exterior tank should be made of iron like other bikes,Gixxer
49,A lovely bike from the stable of Suzuki after a very long time. They have come up with such a model that  takes head on their legendary models like shogun and samurai? It is truly a head turner in real sense its a platform which Suzuki should develop more.,Gixxer

60,About gixxer sf fi the gear is kinda stif. The seats are hard. My back starts paining and I remember while I was visiting their showroom they were offering more than 55kmpl,Gixxer
61,About mileage yes we can say the biggest loophole is mileage as it comes under 150cc segment but you can expect a maximum mileage of 32kmpl which is very less as compare to pulsar 150 and others.,Gixxer
62,According to company the milage is 64 kilometres/ liter . But in real it give milage up to 58 km/liter. Condition is that you have to maintain your bike .,Gixxer
63,According to its looks I will give 5 on 5 as it has great look a lill similar to Hayabusa by Suzuki. I was also confused for the first time and I have noticed many times people looking at it like Hayabusa only.,Gixxer
64,"According to me it is the best in its segment, cool looks, for enthusiastic mileage freak riders . Best in class 150 cc motorcycle The air-cooled, single-cylinder 155cc engine is the same as the Gixxer too. The engine makes 14.6bhp and 14Nm of torque. . The riding position of the SF is similar to the Gixxer's with the flat handlebar and the slightly rear-set foot pegs that give the motorcycle its sporty feel. I personally own gixxer sf, on an average I could get upto 50 km of mileage .The Length of Gixxer SF is 2050mm, width is 785 mm, height is 1085mm, seat height is 780mm, ground clearance is 160mm and wheelbase is 1330mm. The kerb weight of the bike is 139 kg(this means that the weight of SF version just 4kg more in comparison to the weight of Gixxer) and the fuel tank capacity is 12 litres.",Gixxer
65,According to me it is the best most affordable sports bike in India.,Gixxer
66,"According to my personnel experience of this bike, I would to say that this bike is very stylish. there is no one in race of style with this bike. I like this bike just because of its style and power. its fuel consumption is more . it gives less mileage. but it is very comfortable bike. the reliability of this bike is above average but its road grip is just awesome. its handling is really awesome. the only fault in it is its less mileage.",Gixxer
67,"Actually I own this bike. It's a pretty good sports bike in small budget. It's looks super cool. I think 150cc enough for any sports bike like this. This gives mileage of about 45-50 km/ltr. It's doesn't have very unusual seats, they are pretty comfortable.It's tyres have very good grip & it becomes more reliable because it has disc brakes on both tyres front & back. It comes in various colours like blue, black, red & it has a special edition colour too. I think its a very appealing bike in general.",Gixxer
68,Actually it is my first bike so my parents were worried whether I will be able to handle it but it is not heavy like other bikes and trust me the handling is amazing!,Gixxer
69,"Actually we teenagers are enjoying riding on bike and to talk with air., and this is reason I have Gixxer.we all want to express our attitude with bikes and this is perfect bike.now every good thing have some special features and in gixxer I liked the design, average, controlling, power, headlights and the best part is digital meter because just before I buy it I have scared about the gears(in which gear I am riding)and this fear is gone away because in digital meter we can see in which gear we are.second thing is that when riding on bike we don't have any idea about the time and fuel because if fuel is empty we waste lots of time this is also solved because we have this information on the digital meter., and the disk break give you protection when you have stop instantly., now dislikes if you want to go with family this bike is not so useful because of its seat design and rest of the things are best.if you want to ride alone or with friends gixxer is recommended.",Gixxer

71,After 15000 km ride. Bike still have smooth driving good pickup and comfortable in long distancs. Thers a little issue with mileage its starts around 38-40kmpl but now its come around 32-35kmpl. And little gear trouble. Bt still awsm road grip above 100km/hr. Its looks awsm,Gixxer
72,"After a long period of mild sale on indian market, suzuki has mad its royal re-entry on indian market through their gixxer products. these bikes are strictly focused on youth who wants to show them up without tearing their pocket.",Gixxer
73,"After a long time, I am planning to change my pulsar and all my eyes are on Gixxer SF. it has got a good sporty looks, last week when I was crossing road I had seen this in a flash, for one second I thought it a imported sports model. I was aware of gixxer but I didn't now that SF model was also available.",Gixxer
74,"After one week of survey I got confused between buying a Suzuki Gixxer Sf, Yamaha FsZ V2 & Yamaha Fazer V2",Gixxer
75,"After riding it and experiencing it, Everything that Suzuki claimed was 100% authentic. The aerodynamics on the Suzuki Gixxer SF is so good that it can gain real good momentum in very less time. And it offers so much confidence that its rider just can't get over the performance this bike offers. The Suzuki Gixxer SF was launched to take on the Yamaha Fazer and Yamaha R15.",Gixxer
76,"After the launch of gixxer it was big hit and changed the suzuki appearance on Indian market, then they Introduced Gixxer Sf the same bike with faring which leads to mixed reaction on Indian consumers the enthusiasts of biking community where disappointed due to no increase in power and facility but many of young rider who wanted a bike which looks cool and good enough fuel economy had big smile on their face. And this resulted again a big hit; here is my review on suzuki gixxer sf review",Gixxer
77,"Air vents that sit on either side of the headlight are there for aesthetics rather than performance gains. Moving back, the rest of the design is just like the Gixxer’s, so you get the same muscular fuel tank, single-piece seat, a stubby rear with split grab handles and integrated LED tail-light.",Gixxer
78,"Air vents that sit on either side of the headlight are there for aesthetics rather than performance gains. Moving back, the rest of the design is just like the Gixxer’s, so you get the same muscular fuel tank, single-piece seat, a stubby rear with split grab handles and integrated LED tail-light.The air-cooled, single-cylinder 155cc engine is the same as the Gixxer too.",Gixxer
79,"All features of the new Gixxer SF is designed to give a sporty and premium look. It has an Aluminum exhaust end cover, new clear lens indicators and pinstripe on the wheels gives it a sharp and edgy look. Guaranteed all motorcycle, loves will love it.",Gixxer
80,All u know that Japanese technology is ahead of others. Now he had lunched the bike which was made in the same tunnel where the mightiest bike hayabhusha is made.,Gixxer
81,Also  a greater and effective bike in 150 to 200cc.The riding in  the city is very good and suspension which is metro suspension also good.,Gixxer
82,Also it os lose in the top speed.ita top speed is 116 .but the other bike are get better speed then it.,Gixxer
83,Also less space more second person if you carrying a bag with you,Gixxer
84,"Although its average is very decent you will get an average of 50-55 any time and which is more than enough by looking at it, means you will not get this average in any other bike with same muscles. rating 4/5",Gixxer
85,"Amazing pickup and smoothness in the bike which is best in the segment, great handling in the corners which makes it a suitable bike for the city riders, mileage is great both city and highway.Suzuki service pathetic parts availability all are pathetic, gear sometimes feels hard, handle position is not good.Style and performance with great mileage in its segment.A must buy bike for the new riders as well as someone who needs power as well as style as well as mileage.It is the best bike in its league.",Gixxer
86,An impressive design below 1 lakh is a positive point for the newcomer as the price fully justifies its beauty.,Gixxer
87,And a long race of very good mileage of 47kmpl.In this bike very good pickup and very good racing superbike.,Gixxer
88,"And all shading are lovely.but the best shading is blue.The Suzuki Gixxer SF accompanies a 154.9cc single chamber, four stroke, air cooled motor equipped for furnishing riders with 14.6 Bhp at 8000 rpm with 14 Nm of crest torque.its simple and prepared to ride .and I say last just Best look in its budget  .all that much& its made for all lovers of suziki.very much",Gixxer
89,And also this bike has very good quality suspension. I had around 7 accidents on it but I doesn't need to spend even a single penny on it.,Gixxer
90,"And everything  exept this is great in bike.superb handling, balancing is good, front disc is fine but the rear break is not so good. Top speed of bike 130 as dealer said to me but I did't reached that. I dont think that is actual speed of the bike.",Gixxer
91,And it is one of the fastest bike in the mid range series bikes.,Gixxer
92,And mileage provided as of R15 it got style with mileage which made it so good.many bikes are having style but not mileage and if having mileage not the style but Suzuki made gixxer a good enhancement in both perspective providing style as sports bike attracted it more for bike lovers am very excited to ride as it made me feel like driving sports bike.,Gixxer
93,And my friends who got chence to drive this bike they suggest this Suzuki gixxer sf.,Gixxer
94,And no more looks only bluse bike no more colour in this type of bike.,Gixxer
95,And now let's go into topic! Gixxer SF love the way Suzuki has designed the product!,Gixxer
96,"And one more thing I have noticed, even if there is a small cuting on the road or the road is split. it will be very hard to handle the bike",Gixxer
97,And the 2nd person seat is very short so if 2 persons are riding then the back person will be a bit uncomfortable else the bike is good,Gixxer
98,And the back weel keeps skidding. idk its cos of the road but still.,Gixxer
99,"And the most important thing about color is even though by default there is no stickers present on the bike, you can get it from showroom itself. So when you purchase ask for the Gixxer Moto GP sticker. and mind my words this black beast looks superb when you apply sticker over it. It is for sure that wherever you go, people will always look twice towards your beast cause of the stunning looks.",Gixxer
100,And the suzuki manufactured bike gixxer sf is a sport racing bike and it has 155cc engine which is very powerful and has a best pick up in all the 155cc bikes compare to other company bikes.,Gixxer
101,"And then, to my horror I notice oil stains on the garage floor under the bike. Obviously, the service engineer hadn’t tightened the oil drain plug properly, making the engine oil drip. It was a bad idea to take Suzuki Gixxer for another long trip to the Suzuki service station so I got the bolt tightened and engine oil topped up at a local workshop",Gixxer
102,And this has got great pick up and mileage! Suzuki has designed it for youngsters! And got huge success! It's budget friendly! I love this one! But I suggest this only for youngsters!,Gixxer
103,"And to be frank, once you get this bike you can't resist yourself from riding everyday, and flaunting.",Gixxer
104,"Another major drawback of the Gixxer SF is its uncomfortable riding position. The bike has a forward-leaning riding posture that can cause discomfort, especially during long rides. The seat is also quite hard, which can add to the discomfort.",Gixxer
105,Anyone would love to ride the SF. The ride height and seating position is comfortable and would suit a rider of any stature. The placement of the handle-bars is neither too low nor too high allowing the rider to sit straight and enjoy the ride at cruising speeds or even duck down and go flat out. The visor on the fairing helps to deviate the air over the rider and maintaining speeds in excess of 100kmph is not a tiresome task.,Gixxer
106,"Apart from the front fairing, the rest of the design has been retained from the naked Suzuki Gixxer, so you get the same tank, seats, side panels, split grab-rails and tail piece. Even the instrument console is carried over from the Gixxer - with speedo, tacho, gear indicator and clock on the digital display, along with a handy gear shift indicator light. Thanks to this part sharing, the Suzuki Gixxer is currently the most affordable full-faring motorcycle available in India!",Gixxer
107,Apart from this no other issue is there and my friend over all satisfied with the performance of this bike.,Gixxer
108,Appeal - It has a sporty look which will appeal anyone very easily.,Gixxer
109,Appeal:- It has a sporty look which will easily appeal anyone very easily. And it is available in very good shades and graphics.,Gixxer
110,Appeal:It has a sporty look which will easily appeal anyone very easily.,Gixxer
111,"Areas of improvement The bike should get a more aggressive seating position, rear disc brake, split seats, brighter headlamp and a 200-cc version(being greedy here) would make it a class apart.",Gixxer
112,As Suzuki has provided one of it's Best bike in India.Here the one Gixxer SF variant as compare as per the market need.This new Gixxer line up is just under 1 lak. As compare to Hornet 160 this bike have best handling.The tier are more wide due which give more gripe to handle in tight crone. This 160 cc give nice amount of torque at high as well as low. The fuel efficiency is also good for day to day.The seating comfort is also good for both setter .Ultimate this bike is perfect balance in this price bracket,Gixxer
113,"As expect told, Headlight doesn't suits with bike body style.",Gixxer
114,"As far as specifications are concerned, the engine on the Gixxer SF is the same as that of the Suzuki Gixxer – a 155cc single-cylinder, air-cooled motor which produces 14.8PS of power at 8, 000rpm and 14Nm of torque at 6, 000rpm. This engine has been tuned for broad low-end to rque and punchy mid-range. That makes the Gixxer SF very very capable and with decent power in traffic and in normal speeds around town. In terms of mileage, the Gixxer SF too offers very good fuel efficiency, with mileage in the range of 45-48kmpl uner normal riding conditions. Handling is brilliant and ride quality is quite sorted.",Gixxer
115,"As most motorcycle companies launching their beast on road,Suzuki also launched their youngest member of their GSX family. Its a outstanding bike with robust and sturdy make and ultra light engine which make u mad as it can reach 9.5K RPM .",Gixxer
116,"As per my personal review being a suzuki gixxer sf rider, the bike is very much comfortable in long drives. it gives me an average mileage of 45kmpl. it is very stylish and sporty in looks. it looks attractive and its copied design from suzuki hayabusa makes it more attractive. its handling is very good as compared to other bikes. braking and clutching is very awesome also. it is one of the most reliable bikes I have ever come across. it is very light weighted and very smooth riding bike. I have already driven it more than 18000 kms in my hometown. till now it has some minor problems and it is one of the best bikes I have ever come across.",Gixxer
117,As we all know suzuki gixxer sf is a faired version of naked gixxer where sf stand for Sports-fairing.,Gixxer
118,As we all know suzuki is a very big brand and it takes very impressive steps to make its cars and bikes but the sad thing is that this suzuki gixxer sf does not have good handling and controlling and that is the most essential thing that should be perfect in a bike but it is not in the case of suzuki gixxer sf and this bikes fuel consuption is also not good as it shows mileage of 38 kilometers in city as well as highways.comfort reliability are ok types but looks is goo,Gixxer
119,As we know that gixxer sf bike is from Suzuki a well brand which produce great bike.I have recently taken this bike and my experience about this bike is very positive this bike has a awesome pickup and well developed look .This bike has a nice average with awesome controlling and it gives me a high performance in street with awesome average and look.From this it has a nice feature with fabb comfort and suspension.,Gixxer
120,"As with the majority of the body panels, the engine, the gearbox and the cycle parts are exactly the same as the naked Gixxer. So, the Gixxer SF gets a refined, nice sounding and peppy 14.8PS, 155cc single cylinder engine that is mated to a 5-speed gearbox. It’s a nice combo but the gearbox could do with slightly crisper shifts.",Gixxer
121,"As you can tell by the image above, the SF is based on the Gixxer. The front of the motorcycle is where the differences lie.",Gixxer
122,"As you can tell by the image above, the SF is based on the Gixxer. The front of the motorcycle is where the differences lie. . The air-cooled, single-cylinder 155cc engine is the same as the Gixxer too. The engine makes 14.6bhp and 14Nm of torque.",Gixxer
123,"As you can tell by the image above, the SF is based on the Gixxer. The front of the motorcycle is where the differences lie. The swept-back headlamp design is exactly the same as the Gixxer’s, while the full fairing apes the ones on Suzuki’s larger capacity GSX-R motorcycles. Air vents that sit on either side of the headlight are there for aesthetics rather than performance gains. Moving back, the rest of the design is just like the Gixxer’s, so you get the same muscular fuel tank, single-piece seat, a stubby rear with split grab handles and integrated LED tail-light.",Gixxer
124,"As you move towards the sides, you notice the chiseled tank doesn't have any other changes, when compared to the naked version and from here onward both the motorcycles look the same.",Gixxer
125,"At any time you cant neglect its style, muscles and looks. it will give you the feeling of perfect sports bike.",Gixxer
126,At speed of 100kmh it don't get out of control.powerful brakes.,Gixxer
127,"Avoiding all shortcomings, why wouldn't any one consider the high price you are charging out of their wallet. If only one has made up his mind to wash hands off this much of money, why wouldn't he consider Honda CBR 150R or Yamaha R15 2.0? Wish your fat blue baby could attract people only with it's looks:D",Gixxer
128,Awesoe bike suzuki under 1 lack the milage of the bike is very good as 45 to 48 km/liter bike is so fle efficiet,Gixxer
129,"Awesome Bike to ride in the City, Highways.very stable on the road and rides smoothly in all the weather conditions. It is a gem in its class. It is a nice bike which gives you a pride while ride. Mileage is 40-50 in city. Good pick up and smooth riding even in high RPM. Thanks SUZUKI !",Gixxer

140,Before buying I have confusion between yamaha fz and gixxer sf after all comparison I buyed gixxer it means suzuki gixxer sf is better than yamaha fz.,Gixxer
141,"Being a variant of the Gixxer, the new Suzuki Gixxer SF continues to be powered by the 155cc single cylinder, SOHC, air-cooled and carburetted engine that also powers its naked sibling. The motor is light and fairly spirited producing 14.8PS of peak power at 8, 000rpm and 14Nm of maximum torque at 6, 000rpm.",Gixxer
142,"Being connected to the bike generates more confidence when you start to push. Just another reason why I continue to love the bike ride. It is also very reasonably efficient. Given the generous use my throttle, I got a decent 45-47kmpl in faster commutes, at the position of trafficking often goes above 50kmpl.",Gixxer
143,Being in 150 cc bike is more reliable and one can easily afford at ex showroom price.,Gixxer
144,Being in a sports look the bike is short handled and provides an amazing experience while riding. It gives u a great comfort while riding even in roughy road areas. Looks and design is amazing as it is designed according to a perfect sports bike module.,Gixxer
145,Being the most cheapest fully faired bike in its segment it excels in various other aspects.,Gixxer
146,Besides the engine specs in real world condition there is a plenty of torque available under 2000 rpm which makes city touring a breeze.It has that typical free reving engine that inspires from the beast gsxr1000. The only complain that it has only 5 gears.Otherwise it will be the new trend setter in its class.,Gixxer
147,Best bike I have ever seen in my life really its a good experience by having it it really you will love this its like a dream bike its very comfortable to be driven and space inside is very good and the things that a person wants for his journey this bike has got all of these qualities I my self have experience but also have got to know from many of the persons about this bike fuel is less gainer it looks very very stunning and dashing in looks,Gixxer
148,Best bike in its class. If it would have come with clip-on it would be best. Speaking about avg it gives 40+ . The visuals have been inspired from Suzuki gsxr 1000. Tires should have been better. If it's fitted with clipon by local garage. It would be ready for the track bike. Great for youth who are going for 150cc segments full faired.,Gixxer

155,Bike is best designed for the city use purpose for high traffic.,Gixxer
156,Bike is best designed for the city use purpose for high traffic. To control the bike,Gixxer
157,Bike is best designed for the city use purpose for high traffic. To control the bike you get a disc break. and also the PICK Up of the bike is fantastic. It is better than the bikes that you get in higher price of other brands.,Gixxer
158,Bike is good and the engine is refine and stability is also good but the build quality and fit finish of this bike is not that good but gives linear power I use this bike for more than 2 years and this bike is reliable and easy to use motercycle but price is high compare to other bikes,Gixxer
159,Bike is good and too attractive if u want to lure beautiful senoritas.,Gixxer
160,Bike was good built in . You love it when u ride it and when you sit on it . Its a one of the fastest bike in 15o cc rang and within 1 lakh rang.its bike best then the r15 and cbr150 .gixxer sf is looks like 3 to 5 lakh bike in price only 1 lakh. Best bike for youngster.,Gixxer
161,Bikes heart means engine is well designed with 154cc and mileage of 45km/litre. I manage to fill tank with 45 km speed. Over heats on riding continuously.,Gixxer
162,"Blue, Black and Red that make the look of bike great and better.",Gixxer
163,"Both the tyres of this bike are 17 inch and both tyres alloy wheels, and both tyres tubeless, which gives",Gixxer
164,"Bought new gixer last month and went for service on  18.12.2015 at paramaan suzuki, vanuvampet. And reveived the bike condition as rear wheel punture. The air pressure goes down within 15 mins. And front indicator was not fixed as per my compliant.",Gixxer
165,Bought this bike 1 and half years ago and its been an excellent experience riding this beauty.,Gixxer
166,"Brought this for 1, 10, 000₹ on the road. I feel some bad experience from this bike. The body kit of Gixer sf is of no use. If once the bike falls to a side during running or parking the complete body kit will get damaged. My bike accidentally fall to the opposite side of the stand while I am washing the bike my bikes body kit got as many scratches. Poor headlights are another problem it's headlights are not bright for the night journey even it is dim or bright. Back seat is not comfort to sit. The person who sit in the back seat will experience a difficulty while riding but rider seat is good.Other than that problems bike is quite good performance and breaking is good.",Gixxer
167,"Bullet& Honda karizma. This one looks totally different so yes boys, now this blue colour will attract even more eyes than other ones, very unique machine.",Gixxer
168,"But I driven that bike once, that time I feel it is wonderful bike. It is 150 cc bike around 88, 000. The max mileage is 54 kmpl and the fuel tank capacity is 12 litrs. It is better than Yamaha bike also. It very comfort bike compare the other 150 cc bikes. Road Grip is awesome.",Gixxer
169,"But I faced wired problem that after I runned my bike for 500 km I thought to take it for high speed as suggested by one of my friend to get good performance and when I did it my got off when I slowed down the speed after reaching high speed of 120kmph, it didnt start till five minutes, it got started afterwards . I felt scared and rided slowly till 800kms after that again as suggested in owner manual I tried to ride below 7000 rpm but when again I took it for around 6000rpm bike showed me same problem.",Gixxer
170,But I like metallic Triton blue with pearl mirage white colour which is not available in showroom now when I got then I will post again review,Gixxer
171,But I think the disadvatge is that this is very expensive product I must say that.,Gixxer
172,But after taking eyes on all these things we can say that it is a Great bike to purchase if you are not having very high budget,Gixxer
173,But just one small problems is the hight of the silencer pipe is little bit low for which sometimes when I crossed the big speed brekers the silencer pipe touching the road.,Gixxer
174,But no doubt that the bike is great aesthetically and in all other technical aspects except these important things.,Gixxer
175,"But not very comfortable in rough roads.while riding the bike people look at u  whn u stand it people stare at it, asks questions about it.u can feel happy for ur choice.if u a bike with good looks with moderate power with fair price go for it.bt if u r worried abt the fuel consumption then buy pulsar 150as. But suzuki is a good brand, u can trust on.",Gixxer
176,"But now, a time has come when the brand ambassador of Suzuki has had to'cover' himself up, and while Suzuki has followed suit, they seem to have done a much better job. Enter the Gixxer SF, faired version of the very successful 150cc motorcycle.",Gixxer
177,But power is not good and comfert is bad it only like this bike body only bad in power I dont like this this bike is only ok not good control is good and good look also this is not to good some feature are not there suzuki gixxer sf is my dream bike when I saw its advertisement in elision with salman khan I love it s deficiency is also very good suzuki gixxer is avealible in many different colores in the markerr its mileage and liiks are awesome it is very comfoert in any kined of rod,Gixxer
178,But riding is so smoothly and easy.Awesome head light and exhaust sound is not noisy that's good part of this bike.In comparison of best affordable this bike has best bike.This bike can be easily handle in traffic city and smoothly riding.So its good to buy without any doubt.,Gixxer
179,"But the SF is more comfortable at high speeds due to the aerodynamic design. Also the SF caters to a different set of audience, one looking for an affordable faired motorcycle. And the Gixxer SF wins here with ease.",Gixxer
180,But the comfort of this bike is incredible .if u had ride this bike will clearly see the difference in the handling with other bikes in its segment.this bike had a immersive power and blow up the winds easily,Gixxer
181,"But then again, this is not what I was expecting from a faired motorcycle. It would have been nice if Suzuki would have re-tuned this motor to churn out some more power. True that the additional weight does not make it feel sluggish on the street, but it would have performed better in line with the sporty look. The fuel economy of 40-43kmpl could have been a lot better, even if at present it is better than its competition. Even so, consumers will be happy about the refinement of the engine and the minimum number of vibrations even at high speeds, something that Suzuki has beautifully worked upon.",Gixxer
182,But with mask 100000. It also has 1 Moto gp addition which costs 2000.Its millage is also good @45 kmpl approximately.,Gixxer
183,"But with the SF weighing just four kilos more than its street sport twin, performance too is similar to its naked sibling.",Gixxer
184,By changing engine oil frequently you can keep your bike performance good for long time,Gixxer
185,CONS; COMBO BRAKE SYSTEM IS NOT SON EFFICIENT WHICH IS EXPECTED,Gixxer
186,Certainly on the basis of road conditions the bike provides a mileage of about(40 to 50 kilometer per hour).,Gixxer
187,Comfort - The seat and root rash is fully comfortable to long drive and tours.,Gixxer
188,Comfort very good in the SUZUKI GIXXER SF and at a time the brakes rear and front are both are disc .,Gixxer
189,"Comfort — Gixxer SF does not vibrate even at top speeds. I rode it at 125 kmph and did not feel any vibration! That speaks of the volume of comfort the bike offers. You can ride it at a stretch. However, the pillion seat is really uncomfortable and could give you a sore butt.",Gixxer
190,"Comfort- as far as comfort-ability is concerned, it's fine on the highways or where there is less traffic, in the cities its not that good as one has to keep applying brakes and clutch.",Gixxer
191,Comfort- it is also very comfort for two person. but I can drive with three persons.,Gixxer
192,Comfort: basically best for driver but bavk seat is slighted TILTED so when press break person will fall on driver ( which is good for exceptional conditions) .,Gixxer
193,Comfort:- The seat and soot rash is very comfortably designed. And you be able to travel a long distance on the bike without any back pain issues. But it will be a bit uncomfortable for the tall people(5'9'+). But not comfortable for the long tours.,Gixxer
194,Comfort:- Yup so about comfort driver seat is very comfortable and you can drive 300-400 comfortably .,Gixxer
195,"Comfortable for 1 person youngsters, because back seat is too high for Indian ladies(because of Saree)",Gixxer
196,"Comfortable lean and fat also comforting this bike, I like very much. My friend using this bike, so I m drive this bike, good condition good style more colours and comfortable so I m very much like suzuki.",Gixxer
197,Coming to comfort riders seat is very interesting and comfortible and back seat is good for friends and girl friends not for parents. Front brake abs gives comfort to sudden brakes. On rainy and hilly roads gives low comfort.,Gixxer
198,"Coming to the features of the motorcycle, there is not much that I would want to specifically point out as it shares most of the components with its naked sibling. The digital instrument-cluster is straight away carried from the Gixxer and does the job perfectly. The font is clearly visible during the day, in harsh sunlight and at night as well. With the orange back-lit illumination, this instrument panel boasts of the tachometer, clock, gear indicator, odometer, fuel gauge, indicators and an RPM indicator, which are all arranged neatly in the rectangular housing. The RPM indicator is adjustable and can be set in between 5, 000rpm to 9, 500rpm to indicate the gear shifts - a feature that the competition lacks.",Gixxer
199,"Commemorating Suzuki's 2015 return to MotoGP racing, The brand new GIXXER SF sports the Suzuki Racing Blue livery to specific Suzuki's spirit and fervour for racing!

200,Compared to R15 it is very useful and comfortable for the pillion rider.,Gixxer
201,"Cons- Ergonomically not sporty as compared to R15.Rear disk brake was not provided when it was lunched, which doest gives a good braking. I didnt like the long mirror stand infront.That strait bar handle which I didnt like they should provide a clip on bar handle. Which make you feel a sport bike feeling.",Gixxer
202,"Cons: - Though the Gixxer SF is awesome bike there are few bad things as well. The back seat is not comfort just like R15 V.02, legs pain after 1/2 hr and starts itching very soon, after one year my bike started slight rate of vibration when I shift gear, pickup got reduced, though the top speed is 128 it takes slow pickup after 117, mileage reduces once u cross 110 ( 30kmpl) which is bad for 156 cc bike, bike makes some annoying sound",Gixxer
203,Consistently getting around 37-38 kmpl in city riding conditions and 45 kmpl on highways.,Gixxer
204,"Control:- it is having good control, also it has gone through air tunnel test, control is fantastic .",Gixxer
205,"Controlling, Comfort, Style and Mileage wise it is the Best Deal.",Gixxer
206,Cool looking bike that every boy wants to ride it once.only once because when we drives we come to know that the parts are in such a way that it was attached to the bike with gum.It looks aukward when we are riding but looks great when it is seen by others .,Gixxer
207,Coupled aquiring a 5-pace gearbox supplies Remarkable working functionality using a extensive minimum-end torque and dynamic mid-array energy for impressive acceleration which supplies riders a thrilling and exceptional journey!,Gixxer

209,"Definately a good bike on indian streets.Gixxer SF is the Amalgamation of good looks , power and comfort. Blue colour shines out with the flourescent yellow strip on the wheel rims making it more attractive. The double exhauxt give it a sports bike appearance. Digital display is equally good expressing the gears the bike goes through( very good for amatures) .150cc bike has a powerful pickup.Decent average with a good fuel capacity. Rear seat a little higher so sometimes causes problems to climb for the palean driver. Impressive headlights as well as tail-lights.comfortable one can drive more then 100kms at a strech.Overall a good bike for indian roads.",Gixxer
210,"Design is taken from higher version in sports bike nothing new. Speedometer is the worst part in terms of looks, very dull and as if a cheap mobile is been placed instead of actual speedometer. I am talking about some new innovation apart of the fairing and modified GP look.",Gixxer
211,"Digital ignition system which shows every detail about bike. Like- speed, audometer, gears, laps etc.",Gixxer

223,"Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox The engine is incredibly powerful. In fact, I might be exaggareting if I say Gixxer SF actually throws you backward when revved hard. Undoubtedly, it can't meet the power delivery of Yamaha R15 or Honda CBR but it can't be counted out as well. Just rev the throttle and you get power on demand, adequate enough to make vehicles disappear on the rear-view mirror. On highways, the bike just flies, sans any vibration.

This bike is available at two colours blue and red. The red colour is new one in market. This bike has very pathetic pick up and it is a fastest bike. This bike has very good look and body. The engine power of this bike is also very good. The tyres of this bike is broad and the chocopsers are really good and we can experience a good ride on this bike even in bad roads. The value of this bike is low as compared to other sport bikes. The road grip of this bike is also good. The disk brakes of this bike is also very good.,Gixxer
261,"From long time I was waiting for the bike like this and I was little bit surprised to see this bike came from SUZUKI .No doubt the bike is awesome. Its a good replacement for new karizma or KTM duke RC 390  or pulsar 220 .My bikes colour is the signature colour for this bike i.e. blue and it looks awesome.With 150 cc engine 14.8 ps of power it performs great .Handling is also up to the mark .With 1330 mm of wheel base stability of bike is good.

264,"Front face is similar to the GSX-R 600/1000 or the Hayabusa in terms of headlight design and front air scoops. Bike is dressed in Suzuki’s clichéd moto GP colour scheme. A visor up front round and tall just enough to deflect wind. Seating is aggressive as the clip-on are lower and at a sharper angle, something that we didn’t see on the outgoing Gixxer 155-SF. Foot pegs are raised as well as the exhaust end can is articulated upwards for better cornering geometry. Upside down fork, Brembo brake units equipped with ABS considering rider safety assisted with sticky tires is increasing the weight age of the motorcycle in segment.",Gixxer

276,"Gear gets stuck sometimes when shifting from top to bottom level. For ex. when changing from 3rd to 2nd level, it gets stuck between 3 and 2 and need to press one more time to move it to 2. And",Gixxer
277,Gear position is good all the features is better in Battery is 12V and 3AH is Good than other bike.,Gixxer
278,"Gear shifting in Gixxer SF is really a tough task, especially when you are gearing down to 1st for initial pick up after a speed drop. Instead of a quick gear down and raising the speed you will end up in adjusting the lever up and down to find the next gear.!",Gixxer
279,Generally the specification includes. Certainly it consist of an displacement of about(154.9CC). And provides a maximum power of about(14.6Bhp) and a torque of about(14 nm). It is a 5 geared bike with at most one cylinder inserted with it. Fuel tank capacity is of about(12 litres) and a bike can reach a maximum speed upto(127 kilometer per hour).,Gixxer

281,Gixer is a bike which is made by the cpany suzuki. In gixer their are two models of the bike. One with out fareing and other with fareing. Both of the model with and without fareing looks decent from all the bikes. The style of the silencer is uniquecally designed by the engenierrs. It is a very good bike in the budget price of a common man. In the fareing bike it has only one colour combination that is blue and little white but in with out fareing it has many options of the color. I like this bike very much. Thank you,Gixxer
282,"Gixer is a nice bike from Suzuki. It costs around 85, 000 rupees, ex show room price in delhi. The best part is the stunning looks especially with accessories n wings, so perfect for college guys. Girls can easily fall for a guy with fixer. Fuel consumption is a bit high, mileage is average. Good comfortable vehicle. Ergonomics are really good n worth appreciation.",Gixxer
283,Gixer sf is gixer with full fairing thought weight is increased but due to its aerodynamic nature it helps to improve the performance although not much but higher topspeed of 130. The moto gp. Edition is expensive by 4k but it worth the price. The other colours are black and white but blue looks best. Now it has a rear disc break version too. Although I like it if it comes with optional ABS. The acceleration is not brisk but ya you will not feel its 150cc engine. The bike is nimble and has excellent handling capabilities. The bike shows its true colors when you throw it into any corner. The aerodynamic nature helps it and makes bike stable at higher speed,Gixxer

286,"Gixxer SF comes with the affordable price of 97,700rs(depends on the cty).",Gixxer
287,Gixxer SF gains credit of being an affordable package based on the naked street version of the Gixxer. The design of the Gixxer SF is derived from the massive GSX models in the lineup of Suzuki.,Gixxer
288,"Gixxer SF has all in it to be a life-long, uncomplaining, low-maintenance companion. Just take proper care of it and the dividends would be highly rewarding.",Gixxer

294,Gixxer SF is the most stylish bike in this price range and its called as a turn heads bike. Some negative points are there like:,Gixxer
295,"Gixxer SF shares its headlight design with the elders of Suzuki family, especially the Hayabusa's triangular design.",Gixxer
296,"Gixxer SF shares its headlight design with the elders of Suzuki family, especially the Hayabusa's triangular design. An impressive design below 1 lakh is a positive point for the newcomer as the price fully justifies its beauty. It's a tough enemy for every 150 cc rival. Whether it's Yamaha R15 or the Pulsar RS200, Suzuki has targeted every faired bike of each category. The resemblance of the SF to the track racers will push it to a new height. Other rivals of this bike are Hero Karizma ZMR and Honda CBR150R. Though none of these are direct rivals of Gixxer SF but still we can count all of them as a competition as these are fully-faired bikes and are priced below 1.25 lakhs ( ex-showroom price) .",Gixxer
297,Gixxer Sf is very comfortable for both the persons rider as well as the back seater because the back seat is contineous not tall like other bikes. As a bike has seat then the back seater always has in fear of dropping down. Therefore as gixxer sf is having contineous seat the backseater can seat fearlessly.,Gixxer
298,"Gixxer as can be seen from the above images provides a great sportylook which is enough to attract anyones attention. Along with the great sporty look it also provides great performance with a powerful enging of 155c under the price range of 85k.

330,Hai.!hello.friends am abhi.good evening .here am telling you about,Gixxer
331,Handling and comfort of the bike is average but but for a 155cc bike its more than enough.,Gixxer
332,Handling and control:- yup if you look at it as a sports bike than handing is not like a sports bike means it is having normal handling but comfortable. 3/5,Gixxer
333,"Handling and controlling system this bike is good, but this bike price money is very high this reason this bike not many buyer and seller and availability this bike in the market no more.",Gixxer
334,Handling for gixxer is awesome. Tnx for the wide rear tyre. Brakeing is good but not excellent.,Gixxer

339,"Hello Friends.Today I want to explain about my experience about Suzuki Gixxer SF bike, It's one of good Bike for racing and Suzuki is one of old and famous bikes company in Indian When my Brother bought this bike and I get the chance for rider then I am feeling it's one of fast bike and it's average around 50 kmz per litter and it's 150 CC bike, It's pickup very fast and it's look cool so I recommend to everyone for test arrive and buy this bike.",Gixxer
340,"Hello Guys! This is one of my Favourate 150cc Bike ever, I have'd purchased it almost 3-4 months ago, The Bike is very Superb, Superb design by Suzuki, both Faired and a Naked one, But I don't like about Gixxer that Suzuki has usen all fibre material over there and the worst part is Mirror it don't looks cool at all, If the suzuki had given the mirror like Pulsar 220F it will be look preety cool, But not an issue its look cool even when you are not using the mirror and keeping it folded inside, and another worst part I don't like that If you goes above 75 kmph the RPM gets blink, I don't know why Suzuki has given this system, If you are going a long journey it will frustrate you, and the engine also gets heated quickly and takes a long time to cool down, And I personally don't feel the lack of 6th gear, When riding on a highway, The bike goes 117 kmph what I was rode, I have seen couple of reviews in that it shows it can goes 127 kmph which is more enough, What you can expect more than that by a 155cc bike, The best part I like about the bike is Handling, Comfort handling for both a city rider and as well as highway rider as comare to Yamaha R15 the handle is at the perfect distance  from the seat whereas riding Yamaha R15  the back gets pain a lot, Its a best bike under 1 lakh as compare to Honda Hornet, Yamaha FZS V2, Yamaha Fazer, by the way Its your choice guys but I personally think and suggest you to go with this bike, Ok Thankyou Guys, I hope you like my review and I think the review will be helpful for you!",Gixxer
341,"Hello Guys, Now I am review about the wonderful bike, that is SUZUKI GIXXER SF. It is fully-faired premium commuter motorcycle, which is based on the Gixxer naked motorcycle. My college mate have this bike in 2016. First I did't like this bike.",Gixxer
342,"Hello Mates, I was looking to buy a new bike for myself and I had compared bikes like Hero Karizma ZMR, Yamaha FZ 2.0 and Finally Suzuki Gixxer SF.Now let me tell you the reasons why I chose Gixxer SF.a) Karizma ZMR is a 220 cc bike and because of that the mileage was very low, also I wanted a good looking bike to ride in city and you cannot enjoy 220 cc engine when you are driving in city, so the 220 digit was out of game for me, then came price, being 220 cc it was obviously more costly than Gixxer, one more point was there, The Fairing on Karizma is not fully covered, but in Gixxer the Fair covers the front panel. Also the tank design and 3D logo of suzuki gives Gixxer a more sleek look than ZMR. Now coming to the Head Lights, Gixxer Headlights are inspired from Suzuki's very own The Muscular Hayabusa and so the front look is awesome and combinig it with full faired body gives it a look way more expensive than it actually is, but in ZMR the front look is not that impressive.b) I went to look Yamaha FZ 2.0. The bike is very cool and also muscular but what I found annoying is that there is no kick in it and so if your self-misbehaved, you will have to drag that muscular bike to the workshop, also they included some new technology because of that there is no petrol control for reserve, off and on. SO by any chance you miss the fuel station, you will not be able to use the reserve petrol in emergency and you have to drag it again. Both these problems are not there in Gixxer.c) Keeping these things in mind and also the price range, I opted Suzuki Gixxer. Now let me share my experience with this bike.I am using this bike from January 2016 and drove it more than 18000 km, I am very happy with the way it responds, the pickup is still awesome after 1.5 Years, the battery I got is original Exide from the company and its very healthy and responsive even in winters. The MRF tyres are still strong and there are only 2 punctures till date. The headlight flashes very good and so the pass signal. The seats are fine not very comfortable but they do the job pretty decently. The driving posture is very balanced and you won't feel any back strain. The breaks work appropriately.Now lets break these over view into numbers.1) Mileage: This bike is a 155 cc( 154.8 to be exact) engine bike and also weighs more than 130 kgs, so it was natural for me to think that it will not give an average more than 35 kmpl. But you guys will be shocked to know that its giving me a mileage of 42-48 kmpl in city. To tell you, Im not a rash driver, I drive mostly under 50 kmph and use the 5th gear very rarely, also I get it serviced at the correct date.2) Comfort wise I will give it a 7 out of 10. The posture is good, The foot rest are fine, just the seats are a little deep where the tank originates and you may find a feeling to take a break if you are driving it for more than an hour.3) The bike is completely reliable, the engine sound is beautiful and the tubeless tyres make it unstoppable, the balancing is awesome, the center of gravity is at a low point due to weight, the air cutting sharp point below the headlight keeps it to the ground and the wide tyres kiss the ground with much affection, So no chances of slipping unless you are doing some stunts.4) The road grip is very cool, even on turns the bike performs absolutely flawless, no screeching, no slipping and I have driven over 120kmph it always feel like you are stick to the ground, so the grip is very decent.5) The overall appeal of this bike is 9.5/10. I like it very much, reasons being price, style, looks, control, balance, mileage and looks. The pedestrians still give it a look when I pass by and its still a great feeling.Its a complete value of money and in my opinion, you should go for it.Thanks",Gixxer

355,"Hello frnds I just want to tell you I was suggested to buy it as I'm fat(102 kgs, 5'11ft). But had to sell it because of non touring(was doing my MBA). Finally I got a 155 cc bike from Suzuki with my own money this March(still a student at the time of purchase) GSX 150F or Gixxer SF. I went for it because I had 1.10 on hand so couldn't wait or didn't wait to get R15 or RC 200.(not interested in CBR 150 and RS 200) Couldn't test drive it as there were none available for test drives. So I had to make the decision my just sitting on it in the showroom. Paid cash, generated bill and other documents, filled 1 litre petrol(complimentary from Suzuki) and rode home. Bike fell on the 1st hour of my purchase as I was engaging side stand after halting in my garage and there was piece of marble on which I laid the side stand and didn't notice it was slipping. I fell and the bike fell on me. The left indicator broke off and was hanging. Got up and found no damage on the fairing. Clutch lever got scratches on the rounded end. Fixed indicator with Fevikwik. Great 1st day. After this I knew nothing would happen to the fairings even if it fell. Bike fell like 3 times now. No damage on the fairings, but yes back plastic of the mirror and clutch lever's ends got scratched. I put stickers on the bike and put on LED neons, gear socket protector, throttle control engager, tank pad and a saree stand for my mother to sit on the seat sideways and voila! I have a bike that everyone turns their heads to see while I'm riding.this bike is very good you should purchase.",Gixxer

407,I am looking for buy bike which is mid range and sport look best mileage and comfortable for ride,Gixxer
408,I am not recommending this bike since it has lots of lagging compared to bikes at its price.,Gixxer
409,"I am quite astonished by the excellent pickup of GixerSF, however its engine stops in between during a slow run, I will suggest not to ride this bike too slow because this is a superfast racing bike, one could enjoy the real essence while riding it at a speed more than 70kmph. and moreover the drifting is awesome, the diameter of the tires is less as compared to other sports bike but this contributes in drifting purpose. One can feel the coolness and smartness of the bike while drifting . it is very driver-friendly, in the sense that a novice can also ride this bike without any issue or problems. Fuel of rs100 would take the bike run 30kms at a long run.",Gixxer
410,I am really happy that I got a beast vehicle that really a monster and driving experince like a bullet its really smoth to drive and suspensions are really good with a good torque and pickup is very good I get about 40 to 42 km/liter Its a good mileage isnt it ? .Ibgot this bike on 1st aug 2016 now its 24th day im using and performance is same asvthe first day. I think my bike vibrate a littil bit.and also the .ain problem if u buy a suzukis bike the bike care centre is worst in vidharbh amravti not like honda. But in this price range this bike is best and good looking sports bike do not think much just buy it and enjoy !,Gixxer
411,I am really super fan of this bike. I like this bike very much due to its fuel consumption. Its runs very smooth with a gravity. When I ride this bike I think that I drive a BMW car. It is so comfortable to ride. Now a days Suzuki Zixxer SF one the best bike in reliable price. Handling and control power this bike is awesome and so lucrative. When It move on the way everyone turn their head toward the bike.Every one attract for his nice outlook. Its front side looks like a lion jumping towards me.I just say one words that it is awesome.,Gixxer
412,"I am reviewing this bike after using this bike for about three months. It is a nice looking bike people will turn back for looking this bike, when you take it to the streets, it is very much comfortable. Hats off to Suzuki for making such a beautiful bike at such affordable price. This bike will cost you around 90 K( ex showroom DELHI) . It has a maximum speed of 135 km/hr and has a torque of around 8 bhp. This bike has a double nossle air filter and produces a nice sound. The bike will give you a mileage of 50 km/L and after having 2 services it can give upto 55 km/L. What I like about this bike is that it has many varieties like moto GP edition, rear disc etc. The normal Suzuki gixxer SF has disc brakes in front and drum brake in rear. What I dislike about this bike is its Headlight. Well it's upto you but from my side you should go for this bike.This bike has its own pros and cons",Gixxer
413,"I am riding Suzuki Gixxer SF since one year and covered around 13500 km so far. Very few bikes, can match Gixxer SF's handling prowess. Gixxer  SF does not vibrate at top speed. I rode it at 100 kmph and did not feel any vibration, that speaks of the volume of comfort the bike offers.",Gixxer
414,I am riding the Suzuki Gixxer SF for the last 8 months. The bike has a combination of a class sporty look and riding comfort. The bike is a beast in power. The roads of my area have many ups and downs but the bike never gives any complaint. The bike has 5 gears transmition and my bike have touched the highest speed of 119kmph. The body curves are beautiful and the 155 cc engine gives you enough power to climb at any hilltop. Mileage is also good. It gives me 35 to 37 kmpl. Overall I am happy with the performance of the bike. One drawback of tge bike is tgat it doesnt have the auto choke you have to manually pull the liver to choke the bike and then you also have to release the choke after the bike is ready. But the choke is only needed in the winter time. One advantage of this bike is that it have both kick start and electric start.,Gixxer
415,I am riding this bike almost 5-6 months approx.This bike is best for this price segments.And bigger surprice is for me that in that price range I have fully faired bike.This bike is far better bike than other manufactures in that price range.The engine is very smooth and I am getting a milege approx 35 KMPL.The bike handle is slight high for that the comfort is much better compairing to other full faired bikes.In 5-6 months riding the bike is never vibrate or never faults the reliability is also too good.It tyres is much superior for the road and grips just fine in rainy condition.I am using this bike and I will suggest you to buy that bike because its low price range and bigger performance,Gixxer
416,"I am sharing my experience with you. This is different from motorcycle and motorcycle, this bike has a disc brake on either side, the company has given this motorcycle enough look. This motorcycle covers a distance of 2 kilometers in 1 kg of petrol and it does not take much time to catch its top seeped. On this motorcycle, two people can travel a comfortable bad road.",Gixxer
417,"I am still very much enjoying the ride and this month I find myself appreciating the Gixxer riding position. Not so much for your comfort or sportiness, but because of how well you can hold the motorcycle. Flares were exaggerated in the tank and heel plates taller riders are also very functional, close to the knees work well. While you with the center of your foot from heel plates eliminate more enjoyable, it's still much better than most other motorcycles grip.",Gixxer
418,"I am using GIXXER from last 2 mounths.i like it a lot. The best part in the bike isits look. I like it alot. it has a better look then any other avilable in market. thhe pickup of the bike is so fast which is a very good feature yrr. sitting of bike is quite disappointing . it has fully digital meter which is other thing, it shows speed, fuel quantity as well as the time also.so friends dont waste your money on any other thing instead of this tremendous bike.",Gixxer
419,"I am using gixxer sf for 8 months and I crossed 10, 000kms.everything is fine but front disc brake had problem in 6, 500 kms.front wheel becomes tight due to friction in disc brake.i have checked for oil and other basic things but sitll the problem is there.in service centre they said disc plate has bent and they said they will replace it within 25 days.",Gixxer

421,"I am using gixxer sf from about 1 year, and I am facing some engine problem , In starting months it feels very puchy and fuel effecient but after 1st servicing its engine start sounding some crappy sounds as the engine starts to burn very quickly and when I go to the service centre they fill engine oil and told me to run 200km on it and come again to check it . After 200km it again starts to burn engine oil quickly , when I visit the service centre again they just ignores the problem I am facing and again fill up the engine oil as the previuosly they done. After some time I visit to a local garage and tell them my problem, they checked the problem and told me that my engine's piston head gets a fault thats why my bike burns engine oil quickly . So on my personal opinion I will not suggest you guys to buy this bike .",Gixxer
422,I am using sujuki gixxer sf for 1 and a half year.really good bike. feels like high budget bike. suspension are great but not easy to handle for it's weight . good pickup.great speed.smooth engine.

Ok I like this suzuky is best bike mAker com,Gixxer
496,"I liked this bike from many bikes and I have compared them for youI chose Gixxer SF. a) Karizma ZMR is a 220 cc bike and because of that the mileage was very low, also I wanted a good looking bike to ride in city and you cannot enjoy 220 cc engine when you are driving in city, so the 220 digit was out of game for me, then came price, being 220 cc it was obviously more costly than Gixxer, one more point was there, The Fairing on Karizma is not fully covered, but in Gixxer the Fair covers the front panel. Also the tank design and 3D logo of suzuki gives Gixxer a more sleek look than ZMR. Now coming to the Head Lights, Gixxer Headlights are inspired from Suzuki’s very own The Muscular Hayabusa and so the front look is awesome and combinig it with full faired body gives it a look way more expensive than it actually is, but in ZMR the front look is not that impressive. b) I went to look Yamaha FZ 2.0. The bike is very cool and also muscular but what I found annoying is that there is no kick in it and so if your self misbehaved, you will have to drag that muscular bike to the workshop, also they included some new technology because of that there is no petrol control for reserve, off and on. SO by any chance you miss the fuel station, you will not be able to use the reserve petrol in emergency and you have to drag it again. Both these problems are not there in Gixxer. c) Keeping these things in mind and also the price range, I opted Suzuki Gixxer. Now let me share my experience with this bike. I am using this bike from January 2016 and drove it more than 18000 km, I am very happy with the way it responds, the pickup is still awesome after 1.5 Years, the battery I got is original Exide from company and its very healthy and responsive even in winters. The MRF tyres are still strong and there are only 2 punctures till date. The headlight flashes very good and so the pass signal. The seats are fine not very comfortable but they do the job pretty decently. The driving posture is very balanced and you wont feel any back strain. The breaks works appropriately. Now lets break these over view into numbers. 1) Mileage: This bike is a 155 cc(154.8 to be exact) engine bike and also weighs more than 300 kgs, so it was natural for me to think that it will not give an average more than 35 kmpl. But you guys will be shocked to know that its giving me a mileage of 42-48 kmpl in city. To tell you, Im not a rash driver, I drive mostly under 50 kmph and use the 5th gear very rarely, also I get it serviced at the correct date. 2) Comfort wise I will give it a 7 out of 10. The posture is good, The foot rest are fine, just the seats are a little deep where the tank originates and you may find a feeling to take a break if you are driving it for more than an hour. 3) The bike is completely reliable, the engine sound is beautiful and the tubeless tyres make it unstoppable, the balancing is awesome, the center of gravity is at a low point due to weight, the air cutting sharp point below the headlight keeps it to the ground and the wide tyres kiss the ground with much affection, So no chances of slipping unless you are doing some stunts. 4) The road grip is very cool, even on turns the bike performs absolutely flawless, no screeching, no slippingand I have drove over 120kmph it always feel like you are stick to the ground, so the grip is very decent. 5) The overall appeal of this bike is 7.5/10. I like it very much, reasons being price, style, looks, control, balance, mileage and looks. The pedestrians still give it a look when I pass by and its still a great feeling. So overall a great buy for sport bike lovers",Gixxer
497,I likewise feel that the Gixxer SF could have looked somewhat better from the front. Suzuki has held the headlamp from the bare bicycle and I think it looks a tiny bit excessively limit for the bike general.,Gixxer
498,"I live in mumbai. I have taken this bike to alibaug, daman, lonavla and many places, I can ride it perfectly anywhere without any problem,",Gixxer
499,"I love this bike, I m using this bike from last one year I this bike is just awesome the great milage and the great looks.?? and the comfort of bike is really good the seating positon was very good.handling is best for indian roads on a very low price bike giving us the great looks like a racing bike only the maintace cost is higher it gives me in 1 litre maximum 50 km in highay and 40-45 in traffic and because of its good handling I love this bike.",Gixxer
500,I m the great lover of bikes. As compare to other bikes gixxer series is not good in any conditions looks speed and etc.,Gixxer
501,I mainly love the features of bike and I prefer to all have to have this bike.This bike is good and all features is also good and engine is better,Gixxer
502,"I mean when we talk about features then we get a powerfull 155 cc engine, a twin exhaust, a sporty and elegant look",Gixxer
503,I must say that if you want stylish with long millage bike then you will have to buy Suzuki Gixxer Sf.,Gixxer
504,I never wanted to buy naked bike so I got two options Suzuki Gixxer Sf & Yamaha Fazer V2,Gixxer
505,I own Suzuki Gixxer SF. It is carburetor base bike. The thing I loved in this bike that is its mileage. In a city it gives mileage 47 kmpl to 50 kmpl and in a highways it gives mileage above the 50kmpl. It is good as compared to other competitors of suzuki gixxer sf. Headlights is not pretty good. On the upper lamp it is difficult to ride in a dark. This is sporty look bike but it will not give you sport bike performance. As it is 150 segment bike with 5 gear engine. Main benefits for this bike is its price. It is not expensive bike when it comes to sport look bike. Overall at the rate of 1 lakh it is best bike to buy.,Gixxer
506,"I own this bike from Suzuki, I have to travel a very long distance every day and I love to ride this as this is an awesome bike. I like its braking and an amazing road grip. I loved the style and performance of this bike. It has a got a descent mileage and better road grip which gives me an extra courage to accelerate this bike a bit faster. This bike is extremely well built as stated by tariff. The price of the bike is not too expensive and thus provides for a good ride at an affordable rate. I bought this bike purposely because I like the looks and the feel when I ride this bike in the weekends. The braking system is very good and it works efficiently provided with good articulated disc brakes. Solid material is used for the body.",Gixxer
507,I owned suzuki gixxer sf last year its been more than one year now the thing which I like in my bikd is looks I love tbe way its look the bike is 150cc which is very good its can go 60km/hour in just 7 sec and in gixxer the sitting comfort is very good. We can easily go for long road trip with good comfort. The average of this bike is also very good my bike gives average about 45 km /litre km highways and on city road the average of this bike is about 40km/litre overall this bike in this price section its a perfect bike with good comfort looks average brakes. Its a overall package of sport bike,Gixxer
508,I owned this bike before one year it is really good the pick up power of this bike is awesome it can reach up to 125 high speed with 5 geras. It's 155 cc Suzuki introduce a good and stylish bike in market in comparison to others company bike. Its blue colour model is really attractive if u want to buy a bike in 150 segment you can check this bike for a one time.,Gixxer
509,I personally own this bike for 1 year.It is good bike within 92k( onroad price kolkata) .It is a fully faird bike weigh 139kg.Gear shift is not so good it is very clunky after one year it dosen't change too much. I get milage of 45kmpl I set my carb in richer side.The engine is 155cc aircooled. The engine is almost viberation free but little bit vibration is felt on foot pegs and handels over 7000 rpm. In high speed condition certain wind blow from side can cause littelbit disblance due to the fairing.It not compairable to sportsbike like yamah r15. Although it is a good entry level bike for daily commute but can't say fully sport bike because it has no no clip on handel bar but Very good product from suzuki . Style is very good it is truely grabs attention.,Gixxer
510,I personally used this bike and I can say this bike is uncomfortable for long ride due to its hard seat although sitting position is good.,Gixxer
511,"I purchase this bike about a year ago and I think that it was the biggest mistake of my life, this bike cost me around rs 90, 000.",Gixxer
512,"I purchased this bike around a year ago a gosh this bike give you double what you have paid for. The main point of the bike is the looks and styling is just wow and not just cosmetics but also being degined in the same wind tunell where the big bosses of the moto GP bikes of Suzuki is made. The total ride comfort, dynamics, handling and control of the bike is just awesome and has no match in the price segment. I am getting around 40+ on city ride and 45+ on highways.",Gixxer
513,I purchased this bike on 1st January 2016. I read more than 100 reviews and watched more than 25 videos about this bike. But after I purchased this bike mileage is very good I got some 61.6 per litre in high ways and 53 in city traffic Bangalore.,Gixxer
514,"I purchased this bike on Feb-29-2016 it's one year completed, I don't have any intention to spoil Suzuki reputation while writing reviews, why I am writing this review because I am completely upset with what the service they are provided, from, after 3 months of purchase I received engine abnormal  sound immediately I given servicing in TC palya, Bangalore this was the 3rd service then after one week again engine sound starts but I have not absorb carefully after one month suddenly huge abnormal sound came can't able to run the vehicle, I stopped vehicle gave to kolar Suzuki service center they repaired engine after 8days, they told me crank shaft and bearing and timing chains completely broken, in the previous service they have not assembly properly  that's y it happened like this, after this service again after 3 months complaints started so I decided to give on outside for servicing I given it they told me cam shaft and timing chain not properly assembled thats y it's engine sound is coming.service not good not satisfied .Now I have  given my bike in suzuki service center Domlur for servicing they are telling warranty not able to claim to ur bike, one thing I understood if suzuki bike manufacturer in one year this so many complaints, if we purchase a mobile for 10k it will work without any problem for at least one year, but in suzuki bike  In my life Time I will not purchase this Suzuki brand. Now I am not asking for engine replacement only servicing they can provide at  free of cost because of their servicing problem only my bike produced this much sound, I will not choose Suzuki brand in my life time .",Gixxer
515,"I purchased this bike one year ago, In the starting, I was really in love with the bike, I woke up whole night just to ride my bike. I must say that the seating comfort is very good on this bike. Also, the body positioning is very good. You can ride this bike on long routes without producing harm to your lower back.",Gixxer
516,I purchased this in last 4 months and the bike is full filled of power and meter of bike is fully digital and the sound is superb when bike is coming speedly so sound was listneable.but some demerits are the is full of plastic body is the front is broken so the company give option that you nai have to change full front.the broken part can be removed so this a good feature and service provide by company was nice,Gixxer
517,I recommend if you want to update power and torque in less fuel consumption so this bike is very good and perfect for you.,Gixxer
518,"I recommend this bike for guys but for younger generation. Head Lights and tail lights are good. The brand itself says it all, no need of much reviews. Services of Suzuki is quite good in India though the spare parts and accessories of the bike are a bit difficult to find in market but can be brought from bigger showrooms. Rest everything is good. My friend has brought it around 6 months ago, n he is happy with his decision. I recommend bike for youngsters.",Gixxer
519,I recommend this type of bikes who are looking to show the style segment.,Gixxer
520,I recommend you this bike just because of its style and its powerful engine,Gixxer

Its an awesome 150cc bike with a very good mileage. I loved its style and looks which can make any one go crazy about it. After riding this bike I even don?™t check any more option in market. With Suzuki brand name it completely satisfies me.,Gixxer

535,I was the owner of suzuki showroom in rania for 2 years.So I can tell you much better then others.,Gixxer
536,I will complete my review with following list and if this list is your priority then you should buy this bike,Gixxer
537,I will purchase suzuki gixxer 1 year ago. Very good mileage and perfomance.it is very comfort alle seat . It's look like a sports bike.i have 50-55 km/ltr . It's top speed is 110km /hr. It is very good grippable.This is the best selection of 150cc category .,Gixxer
538,I will share my experience about this bike. Actually I wanted to buy a bike that is full framed body and also fuel efficient and also its on my budget.then I got to know that this bike is cheap and good performance bike.,Gixxer
539,I will suggest to go for the SF model than the normal one because there is a huge difference in looks.,Gixxer
540,I won’t write much about the looks as everyone accepts and acknowledges that it is one of the most attractive bikes(especially the Blue MotoGP edition) out there.,Gixxer
541,I'm a user of gixxer sp sf . That is the specil edition of gixxer . Which is greay in color. It is a fabulous bike I really love it.,Gixxer
542,IF YOU ARE A RACER AND LOVE AN SPORTS BIKE THEN YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY GO FOR THIS THIS BIKE YOU WILL FALL IN LOVE WITH THIS BIKE .,Gixxer
543,"INSTRUMENT CONSOLE:-SPEEDOMETER, TRIPMETER, ODOMETER, TECHOMETER(DIGITAL)",Gixxer
544,IT IS A VERY GOOD BIKE. IT IS VERY COMFORTABLE IN SITTING. IT IS AVAILABLE IN MANY COLORS.,Gixxer
545,If I say about rider comfort then its good but once I sat back as pillion and the comfort is not up-to the mark.,Gixxer
546,If I talk about its average it's good it's nice it's mileage is good it's looks is awesome it's handling is pretty much awesome it seat is cool and comfortable tyres grip is pretty much safe and well. Overall it's like a dream bike not much costly and great also .,Gixxer
547,"If factor 2 is longer than the result field, the excess leftmost characters of factor 2 are not moved. If the result field is longer than factor 2, the excess leftmost characters in the result field are unchanged, unless padding is specified.",Gixxer
548,"If factor 2 is shorter than the length of the result field, a P specified in the operation extender position(position 53) causes the result field to be padded on the left after the move occurs.",Gixxer
549,"If u are searching for the sport bike with low pricing than this bike is for you. this bike offers you great handling. We had ridden this bike all the way from Rajkot to Surat. The roads are straight and smooth so we decided to take this bike to off-road, and had also ridden this bike on different road condition.",Gixxer
550,If u want attractive look bike and you want it at cheap price than u can buy Suzuki gixxer sf.,Gixxer
551,If we are going to talk about suzuki company then it's a trustworthy and best two Wheeler company.,Gixxer
552,If we talk about Gixxer SF from Suzuki. It having good power and having better torque. This bike is also design on aerdynamic concept due to which it can achieve fastly to 0-100 is less time. Suzuki Gixxer SF have 150cx engine capacity with 14hp of power and 14 nm of torque. The same power and torque is the plus point of this bike because it can maintain its power and its pickup at this stage. Suzuki Gixxer SF directly give head to head compition to pulsar 150 and and cbr 150. So I can suggest tou to buy Suzuki Gixxer SF if you are lokking for bike with 150cc and and aerodynamic design. You can also take it off road without any hesitation.,Gixxer
553,If you are looking for a sport bike without hurting your pocket then Gixxer SF should be your first choice,Gixxer
554,"If you are looking for good looking bike with good average, gixxer will be the first choice. SF gives you the average around 40-45 kmpl that is pretty decent compared to a lot of other sport bikes. Talking about comfort, the seat is in one part compared to others which have 2 parts ( one for the driver 2nd for the person behind) . One part seat also gives more space for both the person seated. I travel miles with my friends and family. It's easy control and super grip tyres are so reliable. Best looking bike In the budget of 1 lakh. In my conclusion , this is the best bike by Suzuki so far.",Gixxer
555,If you are scarching a full fairing bikes under 1 lack.so this is the bike for you.,Gixxer
556,If you are selling some bike then you should know about the average of the bike in company showroon I am getting tgis type of issue then what about the outside.,Gixxer
557,"If you are tending to buy a fully fared bike by your own money then gixxer sf is the best and cheapest bike in India under fully faired section and 150cc engine. It has got 48km/l mileage and it weighs 139 kg. It has got 5 gears and air cooled cooling system. The suzuki gixxer sf has the max power of 14.60 bhp @ 8, 000rpm and it has got torque of 14nm @ 6, 000 rpm, it is available in 3 different variants and the paint work is done well. Coming to its comfort it's too comfortable when compared to the popular r15 and rc 200. I love the roar sound of the bike and is too smooth and comfortable, the fairing is not a marketing trick it is tunnel tested same as hayabusa, it is a good track focused bike and doesn't have any difference when compared to the naked gixxer other than the speed pickup is better in gixxer sf as it resists the wind and also is comfortable than the naked version .suzuki gixxer sf has become so popular because of its style and is the only bike which is fully faired in such cheap price. Now after all the positive points lets see what's negative, the bike looks too good but there's a gap near the engine, the mirrors may creat a problem in traffic, the suzuki company has done a great job but little more power to the bike is expected, the person sitting behind his legs touches the twin exhaust due to which it looses the color which might make it look little bad",Gixxer
558,If you like that review plz like and share and if u have any suggestion plz cmnt it below,Gixxer
559,If you took the test ride and loved it but you still can't fix it in your budget then you can opt for the normal version i.e. Suzuki Gixxer as I mentioned that technical specifications are same.,Gixxer
560,If you want a sporty look bike r15 and all but your budget is limited then go for this bike. Its a super Awesome bike.,Gixxer
561,In 150 cc segment bikes this Suzuki Gixxer sf is more preferable to buy it.,Gixxer
562,In 150 segments this bike mileage is quite impressive. On high ways you get minimum <50 Kmpl and in city 45-50.,Gixxer
563,"In all other section its good. Suzuki is doing a great work in recent years design wise,  the design of the bike is good and awesome look and the speed is also good but the power is not good and comfort is bad like I said in above comments only like this bike body only bad in power I do not like in this bike. there is good control design wise its an average dream bike of indian roads in this price range. When I saw its advertisement with Salman Khan I love its daficiency is also very good suzuki gixxer sf is available in three colours black, white and blue. Blue colour is the Moto gp edition. I want it in black colour with the suzuki logos like the blue one but that not available or create by the company. why I do not know. So I decided to but blue colour. Its also a good decision. My colleagues also like the design of this bike want to test ride of the same. hey also give a positive feedback and some colleagues feels very bad because they want to ride on this kind of bike but as they are over weighted they dont want to purchased it.The bike is really accept by the country and I think this the first ever great design launched by Suzuki in India. Now it have compete with other manufactures like yamaha, bjjaj etc. the display of this bike has special feature that it shows gear in which the bike presently so that you need to remember it. Suzuki company is one of the leading company but this product of Suzuki named gixxer is average.",Gixxer
564,In city its performence is good but highway you can only rev it to 127kmph. Its my top speed in this bike.engine is so realiable. Its does not heat after long streches.,Gixxer
565,"In design, telescopic front suspension and rear monoshock suspension provide a smooth ride over most surfaces, although we cannot really say about the ride over harsh road conditions without an extended ride. The power is linear and spread out well through the gears.so basically it feels you sporty.it is well-designed unit.black alloy wheels feature a pinstripe, which manages to add a bit of zing to the overall design. meterbox, indicators are beautifully designed.in power, engine hence is the same 155 cc single-cylinder carburetted unit, developing about 14.5 hp and 14 Nm of torque at 6, 000 rpm. engine features the Suzuki Eco Performance technology, riding dynamics front compared with the naked Gixxer. This means that the rider sits almost upright, which isn't the normal position one would expect on a motorcycle styled like this. That isn't a drawback though as the SF, due to this very reason, can be a great bike for covering long distances.so that was my driving experience.",Gixxer
566,In my point of view it is comfortable for young stars and also for middle age people,Gixxer
567,"In spite of using the same engine and five-speed gearbox, the gearshift on the Suzuki Gixxer SF felt surprisingly clunky. Specially, since I have been using the naked Gixxer for the last few months. So, just to double check, I took a different Suzuki Gixxer SF test bike for a short spin and realized that the problem was consistent. But the dealer says that this issue would get rectified after the first service.",Gixxer
568,In terms of comfort it might create an issue coz its back seat height is too high so it might create an issue for the guys with a pain in back problem,Gixxer
569,"In terms of design, the Gixxer SF looks impressive, but the build quality is questionable. The plastic used in the bodywork of the bike is of low quality and tends to rattle and vibrate at higher speeds, which can be quite annoying for riders.",Gixxer
570,In the beginning wherever I went people used to ask me about the bike and they were also amazed by the looks. Not only this even when I used to stop at the signals people used to ask me about it. Even sometime people stopped me and asked about it. And that was the best feeling to have when I passed and people use to stare at my bike.,Gixxer
571,In the end I would just say that this is a great bike and you should buy it if you are looking for a good looking bike.,Gixxer
572,"In the end I would like to suggest you. If you are planning to own a sports bike ( in budget) , go with this. It won't let you down.",Gixxer
573,"In the first impression, the bike looks stunning and superbly sporty. The full fairing design is aimed at providing maximum wind protection to the riders. Suzuki Gixxer SF specifications are similar to the Gixxer launched last year.",Gixxer
574,"In the year of 2015 in Indian market good looking, performance & good mileage 2 wheelers are few. I found suzuki gixxer & it was very new to indian market. I did many test drives compared with yamaha FZ version 2.0, finally I decided to by suzuki gixxer because good performance, good looking, good handling, very confident while cornering, brakes & I like digital speedometer & tachometer in device. Advantages: My bike runs 48 to 50km/liter which decent mileage, right handling, sporty sitting position, user friendly speedo display, good looking & value for money bike.",Gixxer

583,"It delivers sufficient amount of power on both conditions.No complaints till now.Full efficiency is top notch.Design and Comfort is mind blowing.what else do you need.Only thing I found not so good is the service centers(not all the centers).But I found a good one in my town.So friends go for it Its a definite value of money, no matter if its city drive or touring Gixxer Sf is the most affordable, stylish, and well performing bike.",Gixxer
584,It found grip in sopping wet conditions and the engine does its job with great zeal and refinement. It is a hard motorcycle not to like.,Gixxer
585,It gives a approximate milege of 35 to 40 at citi road and about 45 km/l at highways.,Gixxer
586,It gives a mileage of about 42-48 kmpl. The best mileage figures in the segment would make it a highly affordable plus easy to maintain and drive.,Gixxer
587,"It has 3 ranges of color black, blue and white. But in blue it looks best. The cost of Gixxer sf with moto gp addition is 102000 INR. The sports bike lovers who want sports bikes but don't want to spend much should buy this bike.",Gixxer

626,It just have a 154 cc engine which is not as powerful as other 150 cc engines of the R15 or the Bajaj pulsar. Pickup is too low! The bike is unreliable at all.,Gixxer
627,It look like 200cc motorcycle but it is 159cc which reduce the fule consumption result into greater milage. The unique thing is silencer which have 2 outlets .,Gixxer
628,It makes hand hurt after long distance but it can be fixed by putting some handel covers on it which is not a much problemes.its got seven step adjustable suspension but there is one problem that this kind of bike with such body frame it is for mature one or one who is drive bikes for at a year because once the bike fall by any chance it whole will be damaged for changing all new frame it will cost you .suzuki gixxer sf has same engine of gixxer 155cc single cylinder air cool motor which produce 14.8 ps of power. This bike suziki gixxer sf are used by many stunt schools in India for learning stunts on it and Suzuki gixxer sf is chosen by many indian track for teaching student for racing on track in proforsional track in India. Suzuki gixxer sf is very good bike for colloge student it should also bring anti lock breaking system in it because now are day it is very needed for better safety purpose and disk break at rear also for better break and road safety so that people who is riding this bike can feek safer and .it sgould also bring some good suspension on front rear is good with seven step adjustable but front one is bit not up to the mark. And Suzuki guxxer should also bring some 200 cc and above bike with good dynamic and lower price like it.suzuki,Gixxer
629,"It still has the single piece, all-black handle bar, though a clip on would have been more appropriate for the sportier Gixxer SF. You’ll also notice a new handlebar clamp which is said to be stiffer to aid steering, but the black colour of the bolts already seem to be wearing off.",Gixxer

The resemblance of the SF to the track racers will push it to a new height. Other rivals of this bike are Hero Karizma ZMR and Honda CBR150R.

663,"It’s a practical design and hasn’t been designed just to grab eyeballs. So, if you look closely you'll notice that it's a two piece design which will be useful during servicing and, God forbid, if you have a crash you'll only need to replace the section that is damaged, than the entire fairing. Moreover, being designed in wind tunnel, the fairing is purposeful too - improving aerodynamic and downforce. What’s most impressive is that Suzuki has managed to keep the same ground clearance in the SF, as on the fairing-less Gixxer.",Gixxer

732,My old bike are looking good but not good millage but this bike millage super.,Gixxer
733,My search began for a new bike since April 2015. I am a Student and am crazy for a bike the way it Looked.,Gixxer
734,"Net prize - 1, 02, 111.00 rupees in Assam. 1st party insurance and other all document if you include then this bike have 1, 26, 800.00 rupees online.",Gixxer
735,New model of suzuki gixxer sf is aewsome. this year I bought and use it from last 6 months its great. the best thing is its engine 150 cc with best mileage in its field. its sporty look make it best in all. whenver I thought for sports bike I afraid due to low mieage but after using gixxer no need to afraid by mileage.,Gixxer
736,Next month I bought this bike I like so much in this suzuki company.,Gixxer
737,Nice bike with cool look ? . and now with rear disc break. It feels very classy while driving. It gives very good Milleage at this range of sports bikes. The performance of this bike is very nice. with good handling. Top speed of this bike is 115kmph ? and I just love it when it’s engine starts. The Engine sound? .,Gixxer
738,Nice bike with cool look ??. and now with rear disc break. It feels very classy while driving. It gives very good Milleage at this range of sports bikes. The performance of this bike is very nice. with good handling. Top speed of this bike is 115kmph ?? and I just love it when it's engine starts. The Engine sound??.,Gixxer
739,No doubt this is one of the best looking 150cc bike in the segment. the fairing added to this bike is so good looking that it may turn head anywhere you take this bike. Specially in the motogp edition this bike actually looks like it is ready for racing. And the fairing has been beautifully crafted over naked gixxer which adds just 4kg of weight. In fact the headlight is also the same.,Gixxer
740,Not bad the look is good and all the hanset of the bike is good but the issue of average.,Gixxer
741,Not only the bike but the helmet are also best they are coming in matching colours and graphics which gives the true feeling of racing bike.,Gixxer
742,"Not to say that there’s nothing new. The SF does get new clear lens indicators and new shape aluminium exhaust end cover. Like the exhaust tips, the heat plate on the side would have looked better if it had the same titanium-type finish, instead of chrome. Also, the key has the Suzuki logo in chrome to make it appear more premium",Gixxer
743,Not worth for buying. Everything in the gixxer sf is totally cheap. Yamaha R15 is best for the budget sport bikes when compare with the gixxer sf.,Gixxer
744,Now I took my decision and finally decided to have this Beast.,Gixxer
745,Now I want mention the first and most important thing that this product is only suitable for riders!,Gixxer
746,Now a days suzuki gixxer sf is the one of the best two wheelers .also the best part is it looks grand and looks sporty.it is a fully faired 155cc motorcycle which has been developed in the same wind-tunnel where the legendary Hayabusa.Mono Suspension gives you so so comfortable. it'll surely give a new meaning to your love for racing.it fual mileage is so good .,Gixxer
747,"Now come to comfort, the confort level is very good for single person but with dual its not cofortable as its performence goes down . The Gixxer SF comes with a 266 mm disc brake at the front and a drum brake.",Gixxer
748,Now let us talk about this bike this bike chassis are single downtube and front suspention,Gixxer
749,"Now lets come to the disadvantage of this bike, the main disadvantage which I really feel is that its road grip is not that much good. I really fall off this bikes many times because when I push the rear brake pedal, suddenly the bike got slipped and I have fallen.",Gixxer
750,"Now talking about the feel on this bike, the power is as low as compared to R15 from Yamaha& Bajaj Pulsar as150 but still it's having it's own benefit because of more refined engine than others, at the speed of even 60kmph, you will feel like you are SLIDING on BUTTER, sound is smoother than any pulsars and honda bikes whether Yamaha bikes are also providing silent sounds and boosted performance. Now suppose, you are riding with your GF, then its fine on bike like R15 Yamaha but if you are thinking that your MOTHER or SISTER or an old person is gonna sit on R15 or Honda CBR or KTM, oh man that's not gonna work{due to weird jumpy uncomfortable pillion(back rider) seat}; but on Gixxer sf, it's great yes its also jumpy but still comfortable, so boys think on it before purchasing a SPORTS bike that is from Honda or Yamaha or KTM.",Gixxer
751,Now the new gixxer sf fi ( 2016) comes in red colour also and the moto gp edition stickers are also updated.,Gixxer
752,"OK, I admit I am probably the polar opposite of a gearhead, whatever that is. But yesterday, I had an eleven-year-old grilling me about my bike, and I suddenly realized that I could probably compute this stuff if someone would translate it into non-gearhead language for me. I have the stats for my bike in front of me. What do they mean? I would really appreciate a translation that lies somewhere on the technical jargon continuum between 'it goes really fast when you turn the throttle' and what appears in these specs.",Gixxer
753,"Obviously I was looking for various bikes available in market. I started analysis, did some reasearch on bikes. So when I was on road I usually used to see Pulsar 220F in many numbers, it was hint that I liked Pulsar 220F.",Gixxer
754,"On road price in Rs.(subject to change): From 86, 668 to 1, 07, 105.",Gixxer
755,"On road price(subject to change), New Delhi(Rs.): 97, 046(Pearl mira red / Glass sparkle black, with rear disc brake), more",Gixxer
756,"On the paper, the bike seems weak but trust me when you swing your leg over it and twist the throttle it will throw you backward.",Gixxer
757,"On the whole, the Gixxer has remains an extremely comfortable bike, be it on long rides or even a short sprint. The suspension setup, great riding position and cushy seat make it a fun bike to ride in most occasions. In the last six months the bike has been aging well, which points squarely at its well thought engineering and design.",Gixxer
758,One may think that the extra faring is of no use rather than a show but it's not true. The fairing actually adds a lot more aerodynamics to the bike. While in a high way you can feel it by the way wind blast are reduced.,Gixxer
759,One of my frient buy this bike and its awsome to tide the bike.,Gixxer
760,"One of the best bike ever Suzuki gixxer SF. Top class performance, awesome suspension, cool handling, great pick up 155 cc engine, 50 to 55 km per litre mileage gives you value for money.",Gixxer
761,One of the best bike ever. suzuki gixxer sf. coolhanling great pickup and top class performance. and awesome suspension value for money best Japaneses technology. suzuki done a great job and make superb bike thanks for suzuki. style when it comes to style suzuki gixxer sf is a clear winner others may have a different viewpoint but no matter from witch angle you look at the bike it seems the machine is waiting to race. style looking great front is very styles. awesome engine sound. its mileage 38-40 kmpl. final word its the best price range. suzuki has compromised with engine. allover its a good bike.i love it.,Gixxer
762,"One of the best bike in class as compared to r15, fazer, fz, pulsar and more.",Gixxer
763,"One of the biggest issues with the Gixxer SF is its engine. The bike comes with a 155cc engine that produces 13.6bhp of power and 13.8Nm of torque, which is not sufficient for a sporty motorcycle. The bike struggles to reach high speeds, and the lack of power can be a major issue for riders looking for a thrilling riding experience.",Gixxer
764,"Other changes include the top triple clamp and the tip of the unique exhaust, both of which are unique to the SF.In that sense, you cannot take the fairing off and turn an SF into a Gixxer or vice-versa. Other changes include the top triple clamp and the tip of the unique exhaust, both of which are unique to the SF.I am intrested in driving this bike . My friends are very amazed to see me on buying this bike after releasing this bike after 20 days.",Gixxer
765,"Other than the front-fairing and the extra curb weight of about 4Kg, the Suzuki Gixxer SF looks exactly similar to its naked sibling. The key features on offer are - LED tail lamps, clear-lens indicators, digital instrument cluster, aerodynamic fairing. The bike has been made available in three colors - Black, Blue, and White.",Gixxer
766,"Our test bike came in the ‘Metallic Triton Blue’ colour scheme, which sports the attractive MotoGP inspired livery and matches the florescent green pin stripe on the alloy wheels. This is the best colour combination on offer as the other body colour options - Glass Sparkle Black and Pearl Mirage White, look rather bland without any livery.",Gixxer
767,Overall experience is good nothing to worry about. This bike is great for office workers and is preferable for one seater. The bike price is quite high but it is reliable.,Gixxer
768,"Overall, the Suzuki Gixxer SF is a bike with some impressive features, but the lack of power, uncomfortable riding position, poor suspension, and low-quality build make it a less desirable option for riders.",Gixxer
769,"Overall, the Suzuki Gixxer SF is an impressive package. It is based on the Gixxer, which is a fun product to begin with. What the SF gets over and above the Gixxer is the full fairing, which will be a hit with Indian buyers at its price point ?97, 532(on road, Mumbai). With an easy riding position, the SF will be a convenient bike for those moving around the city, as well as touring the countryside.",Gixxer

772,"Overall, this is a great package and also cheaper than the FZ, so it is a great value for money product.",Gixxer
773,"PERFORMANCE - A Bike gixxer is having a engine of 150 cc with 1 cylinder .Its acceleration is not good .And its mileage is 50kmpl as per company but in reality it only giving 40kmpl.I purchased it and not satisfied from its performance according to its price which is 90, 000.",Gixxer
774,PROS:THE BEST BIKE UNDER THIS PRICE BEST HANDLING FULLY AUTOMATIC WITH FULL GRIP ON ROAD HAVING TWO DISC FRONT AN THE REAR RIDER HAS A CONTROL DURING RIDE GOES 0-100 WITHIN20SEC IT HAS 155cc ENGINE WITH5 GEAR COMPATIBLE WITH MAX.POWER OF 8000RPM THIS MOTORCYCLE IS AVAILABLE IN MANY COLOUR ONE CAN THINK OF THIS BIKE WHO WISHES TO BUY WITHIN 87-90K IT HAS FULLY AUTOMATIC FRONT DISPLAY ITS HAS BS4 ENGINE SO IT MOSTLY ECO FRIENDLY IT IS VERY EFFICIENT AND BRAKES ARE JUST SUPERB,Gixxer
775,People will say this is new in market and all that but believe me it is very nice and reliable.,Gixxer
776,Performance wise there is nothing I need to say. It's a Suzuki engine that's reving inside this awesome looking bike.,Gixxer
777,"Performance: With the fairing added it gains around 2 kgs of weight roughly, but with the gearing, it gains little more torque figure's which boost the bhp up to 14.5 @ 4000-8500 rpm and has a torque that kicks in at 8000 rpm with a force of 14.7 NM.",Gixxer
778,Personal Advice- Don't go for red color- its too bright go for the black or blue model.,Gixxer
779,"Personally I have bought this bike and I would like to say that the pick-up of this bike is pretty awesome. My bike current average is around 45-50 its pretty good as it gives you power and average. It also have no vibrations although the bike has fairing. The only problem which I am facing is its mirror its too wide, a solution to this problem has been given within the handle of the bike, you can buy extra mirror and fix it to the handle like a naked gixxer. The Special edition is quite attractive due to its colour combinations. I feel very comfortable while driving and the bike is very reliable.",Gixxer
780,"Personally speaking, the features of the bike is quite good. The only issue is the service of the vehicle, which is for no reason too expensive on the official showroom. The gear box of the vehocle is also very cheap quailty",Gixxer
781,Petrol enginee and air cool this bike is velyebel price 145cc engien is good he is color very nice look bike seet is very comfartebal drive is vey smoodly and front and second wilee disbreck avelebal it's bike seet and stering very comfartebal he is control breck very good secsses this bike in two seet comfurtebl so very nice contro wonderres cantrol he look very good and very very nice look. USE AND ENJOIE THIS BICKE =,Gixxer
782,"Pick up is too good and no problem I have faced so far with the same. But just one small problem is that the height of the silencer pipe is little bit low for which sometime when I cross the big speed brakers, the silencer pipe is touching the road.",Gixxer
783,"Pillion rider really has a tough time trying to get comfortable on the small seat, especially if there is a heavy shoulder bag in the long trip, back pain is a sure thing after the ride.",Gixxer
784,"Pillion seat is not comfortable, family ladies are not allowed on gixxer",Gixxer
785,"Planning to buy this bike , then with no doubt u can give it a go.",Gixxer
786,"Positive sides, less vibration even if u are at 128kmph, thats the max speed it could go",Gixxer
787,"Power of racing means power of abs made the great shining of this bike which helps to run smooth with classically.It gives top personality by the help of their sporty look.This bike shows the power of suzuki autobiles.Digital metres, dual silencers, perfect mileages made their sharpness. When a person riding this bike, the tyres of this bike have consist common type of grips which helps to turn on their road.These awesome specification which makes differentiating from others.Love you 'SUZUKI'.",Gixxer
788,"Power — On paper, the bike might give an impression that it is low on power — 15 BHP — when compared to Pulsar AS200, RS200, Honda CBR, Yamaha R15 etc., but once you twist the throttle and the engine starts grunting, you will realize that Gixxer SF is pretty powerful for a 155 cc bike and is probably, one of the best bikes in the 150 cc segment, in terms of power.",Gixxer
789,"Powering the SF is the same 154.9 cc single cylinder motor as on its naked sibling. Though, the fairing adds an additional 4 kilos to the bike, it doesn’t hamper in the handling at all infact it provides more confidence because of better aerodynamic characters. Its motor generates 14.8 PS of power that is full thirteen percent higher than that of Yamaha Fazer, its biggest competitor. The gearbox is a bit notchy but still the SF feels very punchy in the city and can cruise very easily on the highway at a reasonable speed of around 80 k mph. Despite all this, the engine manages a fuel economy of little over 60 kmpl, certainly when the bike is ridden accordingly.",Gixxer
790,"Powering the Suzuki Gixxer SF is a 154.9cc, single-cylinder engine that churns out a maximum power output of 14.6bhp at 8, 000rpm while yielding 14Nm of peak torque at 6, 000rpm. The same engine also powers the naked Gixxer.",Gixxer
791,Pros- At this price tag its looks promising. Full fairing sporty looks.,Gixxer
792,"Pros: - The good things are more in the SF Gixxer package. Nice sporty look, Attractive Mask, Initially pickup was great, Tyre Grip is too high and no fear of puncture as it got tubeless and wide tyre, you can bend the bike till you get scare tyre wont looses grip ( except rain) , decent mileage of 45 hmpl @ speed of 70-80 kmph and 30kmpl @ 110+ speed. Smooth gear shift, feels great @ the speed of 70-80, Bike wont loose control and comfort after crossing 100+ speed also. Bike engine sound is plus point, Light is too wide and powerfull, maintenance is not high- suzuki service is very nice as of now, Mirror adjustment & look is nice, Top speed is 128kmph.",Gixxer
793,Pros: The design of this bike is awesome. The fuel economy it provides on Indian roads both inside city and highways is batter for the pocket. I get attracted to the front side and the exhaust pipes all the time. This two are the most attractive feature. The handling quality of the bike is also very good. The engine provides good power delivery and the overall experience is good. Cons: headlight high beam is not ok pls improve or upgrade,Gixxer
794,Pulsar AS series has been welcome in its competition and excel far better than any models.,Gixxer
795,Recently I bought the bike. I was amazed with the looks of the bike. Not only this the features are also best that one can get at this price. Its an extreme pleasure to ride this bike.,Gixxer

805,"Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality is awesome and handling is brilliant. For a bike, that weighs more than 300 pounds and carries me(almost 200 pounds), the handling is brilliant. It maintains a straight line, sticks to the ground and does not deviate. The wind blasts are taken care off by the fairing and windshield and you don't need to worry while riding in high speeds. Oh yes, if you duck down while riding post 90-100 kmph, your body would tackle the windblasts better.",Gixxer
806,"Ride Quality& Handlin Very easy to handle in traffic, back seat is little high but for rider its very comfortable.",Gixxer

826,Seating is not much comfortable you will feel tired very soon usually I can ride 250kms without any stop. But on this my longest ride is 134kms so I can say it is not that comfortable.,Gixxer
827,"Second is its service centers.  They are good in servicing work but not skilled if your bike got some problems they will not able to find it.  I have experienced it.  Once I have to take claim for body work due to a accident happen, suzuki persons says they had done wheel balancing but my handle was  tilted on right side.  They had done wheel balancing again but I got my bike with little tilted handle again. . So I again visited service centre this time they used hammer to make bike handle in correct position but results same they are not able to correct its  position. After more than 10 repeated visits to service center they able to identify the problem and they able to correct my bikes handles position.  But now it have another problem because they hadn't done wheel balancing earlier even on second time.",Gixxer
828,"Seems like Suzuki Gixxer SF is nothing but the bedecked sibling of Gixxer NS, with not even an inch of power bump. Same machine, with heavy armour, no doubt results in low mileage & shorter engine life. It's like you are roaming around on Gixxer only, but with a pillion all the time.Bad idea, isn't it?",Gixxer

1011,"Suzuki is good to go for a long while in the wake of being quiet to go up against its adversary. The real buzz originated from bike, however the second enormous thought was the Gixxer which has quite recently unmistakably taken off like a rocket into space and now essentially commands the portion from'above'. Give it a chance to be deals or execution it wins hearts promptly. The reason? Indians need liveliness and common sense from their cruiser and Suzuki conveys this in spades since the very beginning. A bike that was difficult to blame with(putting our occupations in peril) as there isn't much to scrutinize. Be that as it may, now, it gets emanation neighborly and economy expanding fuel-infusion framework. The carburetor has been supplanted and frame shrewd there is another circle brake at the back. We invest some quality energy with the bicycle to give you a complete decision of the motorcycle.Design Styling astute it has been effective since the very first moment. In any case, a say required here is that each shading plan removes the dealership floors promptly as well. You can recognize the Moto GP version to the dark, red, white and different choices out and about by the crowds. The bike has the superbly cut side fairing boards alongside a smooth tank and moderate tail-piece with a huge clear lense tail-light which has LED in them just makes things quickly attractive.T he 2016 Suzuki Gixxer SF Fi here has new decals set all around which has an ""advanced"" impact to it indicating that there is ""electronic"" slyness occurring in the energizing framework. Red sewing on the seat is dependably an awesome expansion. The pinstripes on the wheels, the substantial double port fumes and the fat suspension units on the two closures ensures it is the perfect bundle for individuals who cherish riding and furthermore gazing at their cruiser once a day. Ergonomics The riding position is upright as the handlebars are raised. Notwithstanding, the seat is a little lower which at that point finishes the lively riding position without much complain. The handlebars tumble to your hand flawlessly and the seats are all around padded and an all around estimated to help expansive riders additionally feel great. As you can make out from the greater part of this, Suzuki proceeds with its custom of offering sitting ""in the bicycle"" and not on it. More goes ahead that viewpoint when you understand your knee's secure consummately on the tank the minute you begin inclining. Mirrors on our test bicycle weren't ""screwed"" legitimately. The ORVM's are likewise vast and can cause block in our tight movement conditions. We heard numerous clients say the same and now we think we have encountered different circumstances as well, when we tried the bicycle. A shorter, better outline one year from now could offer assistance. Generally, another region where the bikes inspires altogether. Speedo And Switches T operation indent quality, essential switchgear is available which has a motor off button, pass light and different alternatives ticked impeccably. Something that the opposition could gain from. Speedo since day is constantly featured by group Suzuki. We recollect Japanese architects saying that'Market requires more data from speedometers'. Suzuki has given the same here. Rigging shift pointer, RPM redline marker, Eco and Power mode, computerized tachometer and speedo, motor check light, singular turn markers, high shaft alongside nonpartisan obvious lights. A best speed recorder, two excursion meters, clock, fuel gage and an odometer finish the bundle and influences it to portion best too.Engine and GearboxPerformance is the place the Gixxer sparkles. Consummate measure of low and mid-extend torque alongside a solid and fragment best end control on account of astute adapting(not very short or not very long) is obviously a masterstroke overs its opponent which have both of the two things. What has changed and overwhelmed us is the motor NVH and smoothness. The 99.8% vibrations that were absent on the Gixxer, even that restricted has been raised. The motor is totally vibration free and even at redline there isn't humming that will influence your hands to go numb. The motor keeps on making 14.8 BHP of energy and 14 Nm of torque from the air-cooled 2-valve engine that we have seen some time recently. Fi has been utilized as a part of the correct course for most of the range. Smoothness of the motor influenced us to understand that have we picked the correct bike. Multi-barrel level of smoothness for a solitary chamber all through the rev extend just makes it engaging at this point. What has been lost is the bit of character and the soundtrack that the old bike had. The motor turns thrumy at the best end and the profound bass is practically gone. The motor is more resonating, free revving and there is no punch once you approach the 5000 RPM as you rev it ahead. Stellar execution proceeds as before on the grounds that the SF gloats of the most minimal kerb weight in its class. We accomplished a consolidate cycle of 48.3 km/l when tried on the interstate and in top movement. Expect comparable execution as before as well. Generally speaking, an exceptionally direct power-band and all around dispersed torque implies that extricating horses from this motor is presently more ""easy"" than some time recently. Elements Armed with the fragment, pundit and open top pick, single down tube outline and adaptive front forks which are bigger in breadth alongside a monoshock that is movable, it has the correct fixings to be a champ. How about we not overlook the fat tires by MRF that work in dry and wet circumstances alongside that, it gives great general life as well. Since they are outspread units, they convey more fuel-effectiveness also. As some time recently, the Gixxer SF remains a hoot to ride quick or moderate. The front-geometry which isn't excessively steep or too rake forward gives it a perfect adjust for moving in the city in tight spots as it the lower rake helps in the same.Meanwhile, the rake additionally gives great interstate levelheadedness and affirmation with regards to front-end input and strength. Ride quality notwithstanding being on the stiffer side keeps on being sufficiently consistent in the meantime for our broken streets to a degree. It isn't out and out cruel as more premium bicycles sitting in the classification above. The cruiser keeps on being light, deft and balanced in the meantime in the corners.The three words are once in a while synonymous and meet up with any bike with regards to clarifying elements. The solidness can divert you from a bit with regards to taking care of mid corner knocks, yet no where out and out cruel that it irritates the entire self-control. As you can figure at this point, it is agile in the city too while being fun when you take it to the closest corner cutting goal occasionally.Brakes, we weren't a devotee of the vibe since the start, yet there is a slight change, particularly at the front. In any case, the bike offers enough ceasing power since the very beginning. Raise brakes, which is another unit which has 220mm circle alongside single-pot NISSIN caliper likewise needs feel to a degree, however it is sufficiently effective at any speed to help put the stays down.Suzuki Gixxer SF Fi Review, VerdictThe Gixxer SF Fi is a major jump notwithstanding the way that item came before and this could be named as a minor refresh. The truth of the matter is, it is most certainly not. The Fi framework works ponders as it enhances NVH by an immense edge, the level of certainty increments while riding. The power and torque alongside very much tuned gearbox, makes it a perfect power-band that is another benchmark in this fragment. Offering execution and common sense has never been so very much adjusted. Suzuki is charging just Rs. 6, 000 over the carburetor. Nonetheless, the cost achieves Rs. 1 lakh in a few urban communities and at the cost there are other'capable alternatives'. Be that as it may, there are still things the opposition can't offer even today and Gixxer keeps on being a perfect passage level completely faired bike which has all the cases ticked for the buyer of this portion. Cost As Tested: Rs. 1.03 Lakhs On-street Delhi(Rear Disk - Fi)",Gixxer

But when u go above it u will feel vibrations and sometimes you will feel like its out of fuel or like its starving. Acceleration, its gonna thrill u better then fz, apache rtr 150, pulsar 150 or similar bikes. Maintanance, its the catogery, where it beats all, the maintainance is very lov, the fuel economy is very good, trust me u vill enjoy every single rupee of its fuel. The spare parts and the fairing are cheaper in comparision of othe faired bikes. Abot comfort, the rider seat is very comfortable but the pillion will give you pain in most of the cases. The rider's seat coushining is good whereas pillion is on the lower side. The comes the control, it have a very good riding position, when you wana duct it gives you that space and when you wanna cruise its gives you the upright sitting posture. Tyres a impressive. I spinned lot of bikes but non of them had this much stickey stock tyres. Intrument cluster is good, gear indicator and clock are good offering in the cluster.

Within 4 years the metal completely rusted thru forming a hole next to the fuel cap. I had to pay 6580 Rs for Tank replacement.,Gixxer
1139,The color combinations look weird and I do not like any of the color combinations. Suzuki has tried to introduce a great sporty bike for India but I think they have failed in doing so.

1151,"The engine makes 14.6bhp and 14Nm of torque. But with the SF weighing just four kilos more than its street sport twin, performance too is similar to its naked sibling. Top speed is around 127kph.  The riding position of the SF is similar to the Gixxer’s with the flat handlebar and the slightly rear-set foot pegs that give the motorcycle its sporty feel. The 155cc engine belts out a healthy dose of torque north of 3500rpm, and power is available all the way till 8500rpm when the rev limiter intervenes.",Gixxer
1152,The engine of this bike does not get overheated so this bike is nice for longdrive.The colour given to this bike are mind blowing and the maintenance of this bike is very low.The gear system is also nice.,Gixxer

Indicated speeds of more than 130kmph are possible but 80-90kmph is where the rider is going to be very comfortable.",Gixxer
1154,The engine remains the same 154.9 cc unit producing 14.6 BHP and 14 NM of torque. The braking and suspension part remains also the same as the base version.

1157,"The following message, posted on a motorcycle forum that I used to run, was the motivation for me to provide these definitions of terms used in motorcycle specifications.",Gixxer
1158,The following provides definitions of terms to demystify motorcycle specifications as usually listed in the motorcycle magazines and on Internet Web sites. These definitions of terms should be easier to understand by riders who would rather ride than learn the technical complexities of their machines.

1160,The front disc brake is progressive and is very unlikely to make you lose control even during panic or sudden braking. The rear brake needs some adjustments by the mechanic. A rear-disc brake would have been highly appreciated.,Gixxer
1161,"The front is fully-faired to look as sporty as possible, but you do not get clip-on handles or rearsets. The tail section is similar to that of Naked Gixxer with step up seat, exhaust muffler with an aluminium cover, LED tail light and split grab rails. Even the instrument console is carried over from Naked Gixxer together with all essentials. There is also a MotoGP edition Gixxer SF available with Suzuki Racing Blue livery.",Gixxer
1162,"The front mirrors on this bike are like horns that gives an aggressive looks to it. somehow when the mirrors are closed they look MORE attractive. I am having the version with both front and rear disc installed(for better riding protection). The silencer(exhaust) on this bike is really a fantastic one(its actually a dual silencer) promising great sound and performance. Now talking about the tyres, the front tyre is 100mm wide& rear one is 140mm which is as wide as Yamaha FZ and Fazer. The great thing you will like in this is, as compared to Yamaha R15& Honda CBR, the rear mudguard is so attractive and rigid so that it give a real sport feel with the wide tyre below it, one more option is that Suzuki provided a way to remove the Rear mudguard so that it gives even more fantastic look that is demanded by schoolboys and fukreys(funky) boys;).",Gixxer
1163,"The front of the motorcycle is where the differences lie. The swept-back headlamp design is exactly the same as the Gixxer’s, while the full fairing apes the ones on Suzuki’s larger capacity GSX-R motorcycles. Air vents that sit on either side of the headlight are there for aesthetics rather than performance gains. Moving back, the rest of the design is just like the Gixxer’s, so you get the same muscular fuel tank, single-piece seat, a stubby rear with split grab handles and integrated LED tail-light.",Gixxer

Styled in tandem with the regular version, the additional fairing further accentuates the sporty flair lending a muscular look to the bike. Powering the fully faired Gixxer is the same 155cc engine that does duty on the standard version.",Gixxer
1168,"The gear shifting was incredibly messy before the first servicing. Even after getting the servicing done, gear shifting has not become that smoother. But don't lose heart, it is very muchmanagable. While it's not butter smooth, it won't leave you stuck also.",Gixxer
1169,The gisser sf 155cc bike is reaaly quite awesome for its look but not its power. people think that it will be a 250cc bike but it is not. The sound of firing is quite ugly.

Suzuki bikes are well known for its comfort and its build quality. The mileage of this bike is about 40-45 kmpl on city roads and it gives above 50 kmpl on highways. The handling of this bike is so good that it offers so much confidence while driving. Besides this this bike comes with a super sticky MRF tyres so that it can provide proper grip to the road .

1197,The newly dressed Gixxer SF and naked Gixxer 155 share the same muscle under the shirt. The 154.9 cc single cylinder air cooled mill churns out 14.6 Bhp @ 8000 rpm with a torque value of 14 Nm @ 6000 rpm. The engine is mated to a 5 speed manual gearbox.

1199,"The next to touch is the dual tone exhaust. Man. the sound it produces is enticing and pushes you to do more than just driving. And the best part is mileage. I drive it in a metro @ an avg of 5500-6500 rpm and the mileage that it offers is around 48-51 kmpl. The downside of the vehicle is plastic controls(it does the job really well, could have been back-lit and crispier than it is) and no clip on handle bars. Still you can get it altered in a local motor garage.",Gixxer
1200,"The only difference between the regular version and SF variant is the full fairing while it borrows key styling features such as LED tail lamps, digital instrument cluster, clear lens indicator etc from its naked sibling. Available in three colour schemes, SF has inherited the chiselled fuel tank from its naked sibling. The oval-shaped dual exhaust and the Y shaped-three spoke alloy rims have also been carried over from the regular Gixxer.",Gixxer
1201,The only down side of this bike is the lack of the sixth gear. The previous bike of suzuki the GS150R was the first bike in 150cc that comes with the sixth gear. If it was present in the gixxer series then it would be the market leader of indian two wheeler segment. No need to worry it is the buyers choice.,Gixxer
1202,The only drawback is that the bike is a bit costly considering the engine capacity which is only 150CC. But the full fared body justifies the price completely.,Gixxer
1203,The only problem this bike has is pillion comfort.it is not suitable for pillion.,Gixxer

The 155cc engine belts out a healthy dose of torque north of 3500rpm, and power is available all the way till 8500rpm when the rev limiter intervenes. We do wish the engine could have revved higher for more top end grunt, but then again, the Gixxer SF is not an outright track machine.

1280,This bike have high power engine by which it take much speed in few seconds and its gear feature is also easy and cool to change gears. By this on traffic road it run easily with no problem. Its disk brake is also high power by which easily in few seconds it stop and in emergency it stop in less then one seconds. Average of this bike is also better then other bike.,Gixxer
1281,This bike having lots of comfort for bike driver and most important his good looks and his handling is so awsome. This bike looks like suzuki hayabusa . This bike is aerodynamic. And when you drive this on long root his cuts and edges is very sharp. But here is a big problem which is fule consumption company claims 62 kmpl but its actually 30 to 33 kmpl only.,Gixxer
1282,This bike is 155cc engine displacement. It has a good perfomance engine. This bike is nice in performance and looks. This is very fuel efficient bike. This bike is one of the sports modal bike launged in India.,Gixxer
1283,This bike is 155cc four-stroke single cylinder air-cooled engine and the five-speed gearbox haven’t undergone any changes for the SF.,Gixxer
1284,This bike is a city commuter in the shell of sports fairing but you can also carve corners on this bike. It has 7 step adjustable rear mono-shock which you can adjust according to your riding style. on the front side of head lamp there are faux air vents which are of no use side panels have air scoops though. and is essential too because engine is air cool unit.,Gixxer
1285,This bike is an awesome product of Suzuki with an average of between 50 to 55 kmpl and a sporty look.comfortable enough unlike other sports bike .balance handling and control of this bike is fab and is unmatched wid any other bike in the range.awesomness along wid top speed of 110 km/hr makes this bike really a wonderful bike to have on,Gixxer
1286,"This bike is an over rated bike. The price is too high as compared to its performance. I bought this bike last year in October and it did not meet my expectation. I have to shell out almost 100 thousand bucks to buy it and then it just disappointed me. The head light do not suits the bike body style at all. Suzuki had retained the headlight from it's naked bike but I think it looks too narrow as compared to the bike's body. The digital meter appears to be a dauntingly crammed full of stuff. It takes a lot of time to adjust to this meter. The entire upper panel of SF sits on a ocean of plastic frames, which I think could have been exchanged with a better solution. All the bike within the category of 150 cc - 155 cc should at least have a mileage of 45 Kms/litre. But this bike fives me only 35 Kms/litre and also 30 Kms/litre in the city. Also I have discovered lagging issues while in upper gears. It also requires a fortnightly servicing as compared to the other bikes like R15 etc in its category. I will personally not recommend this bike due to a number of shortcomings at this price range.",Gixxer
1287,This bike is attracting the people now a days its cost is below 1 lakh rupees. Who wants to buy sports bike below one lakh rupees they can easily afford this bike. Riding in this bike was fantastic and style was really pretty.,Gixxer
1288,"This bike is awesome.the bike looks attractive, sporty. the milage of the bike is also great.the handling of the is also good and the seating position is also comfortable and we can use this bike for city as well as highway also n long distance touring also and the grio from the tired is also good and braking performance is ok and bike feel stable at high speed and faring helps to cut the wind with eas and sf stands for sport paring and fuel tank is 12liters. at last this is the best looking 15occ bike in the market",Gixxer
1289,This bike is bes and cool this bike fuel consuption is 75/liter is best and very good I like this bike evareg is bst and benifited this bike 7liter fuel tenk one silendar 4stock,Gixxer
1290,This bike is competitor of Bajaj Pulsar 150 to  200cc. I like this bike very much.,Gixxer

1292,"This bike is just a really wnna be bike. I guess suzuki just made it out of desperation to compete in the market with bikes like yamaha's fz, r15, tvs's apache but hasn't really did the job well. its got an OKish mileage of 35-38 on road but it still couldn't beat yamaha's fz which is better in not only mileage but also looks better and is a lot more comfortable. its got fine road grip, handling could have been much better and is even better than tvs's apache but is still nothing comared to the fz. overall its a fine product if you looking for a cheaper looking FZ.",Gixxer
1293,This bike is just like a smoothness in walking.just like a smooth air bubble in the sky is moving and handling control is superb This shows the attitude of having kust like a big bullet and just as the brand of suzuki is weel designed in the market.the roads and mileage of the bikes on the roads is superb above 75+ and the petrol is just like 75 km/hr in the middle of this generation the youth shold have this type of bike and the bike should looking just wonderful so please buy this bike through your store near about your home and be careful with the handling because the suzuki brand launches the bikes and cars in india and other countries so smooth and colour and designed is too heavy and looks preety colour in the city when we are going some where,Gixxer
1294,This bike is just way beyond saying anything but I think its price is quite on higher side but its value for money deal breaker.,Gixxer
1295,This bike is most attracting bike and its all features are looking and working best.,Gixxer
1296,This bike is not so much comfortable as the reviews are saying.the prices is very much and fuel comsuption is to high you cannot enjoy the lovely and comfortable traveling with this bike its damping system is totally fail and the speed like limit is not too good so its my advice to not wast your money to buy such types of bikes,Gixxer

1298,This bike is readily being accepted by the youth of this country and I can see lots of Gixxer SF bikes in the market whenever I visit market. The display of this bike has special feature that it shows gear in which the bike is presently so that you need not to remember it.,Gixxer

1300,This bike is so cool. I was had a same colour bike and the nice of somes.and price is normal so everyone had this bike. I think this rating of bike is wrong.becoz I think up to 4.7 rating. and the model of the bike is brand new. in hindi: - mere pasand bhi yhi bike hain.or price bhi kuc jyada nhi hain.aam aadmi is bike ko aaram se effort kr sakta hain.or brand ki to baat hi mat pucho.or model bhi nya hain . look achi hai. in end look like sexy.,Gixxer
1301,This bike is so good that it can overpower any bike in this segment.,Gixxer
1302,"This bike is sports bike segment so looking dashing, sporty. Handling is quite heavy. Acceleration is awesome. Fuel economy is not so good but it's sport bike so don't judge fuel economy. My bike gives 40-45 kmpl. Once I dropped my bike and it's front visor break down. I done Fiber welding. So be careful while drive it.",Gixxer
1303,"This bike is value for money because under ₹ 87, 000, this is greate bike.",Gixxer
1304,"This bike is very attractive looking and I love it first sight.but when I bought it I am very much disapointed and feeling guilty with my desision, it is very fuel consuming and it consumes one litere fuel petrol in just in 48-49 kilometeres.",Gixxer

1306,"This bike is very good but it's comfort level is I think not good. It's mileage is good with the comparison of other sports bike. Before one year I buy this bike and I can see this bike is very trustable and it's feature is best with the comparison of other bikes because they show gear, speed and other new functions. The sitting management of this bike is not good but controlling is very good. It's road grip is very good because the balance of this bike is excellent. My appeal is provide good sitting quality.",Gixxer
1307,"This bike is very very great in all like in Average, Performance, Look, and in awards.",Gixxer

1310,This bike really good choice in racing bike looking on thise bike is very good looking.I personally own this bike for 1 year.It is good bike within 92k( onroad price kolkata) .It is a fully faird bike weigh 139kg.Gear shift is not so good it is very clunky after one year it dosen't change too much. I get milage of 45kmpl I set my carb in richer side.The engine is 155cc aircooled. The engine is almost viberation free but little bit vibration is felt on foot pegs and handels over 7000 rpm. In high speed condition certain wind blow from side can cause littelbit disblance due to the fairing.It not compairable to sportsbike like yamah r15. Although it is a good entry level bike for daily commute but can't say fully sport bike because it has no no clip on handel bar but Very good product from suzuki . Style is very good it is truely grabs attention.,Gixxer
1311,"This bike sports a 155 cc powerful engine. Compared to all the 150 cc bikes I personally feel that it is the most powerful engine. The sound of the engine is pretty roaring which gives you a sports bike feel. It has awesome pickup, not just the starting pickup but also while driving in 4th or 5th gear the bike gives good pickup.",Gixxer
1312,"This bike the worst engine of 150cc ever. I mean come on if you are spending around 90, 000 rupees and you will get the engine which is only 150cc its really not good I guess, you can go for pulsar 220 which have a great 220cc engine but still in that bike also you will not get the control you need.",Gixxer
1313,This bike was really awesome one .I would suggest this bike for everyone who have an idea of buying new bike. its an coolest bik comes on few colours. I would suggest you to get blue gixer sf which looks stlylish and sexiest look. the bike giving an good mileage. good performance and suitable for all youngsters and perfect to buy for all peoples. it has an 5 speed gear box with mono suspension. it has both self and kick start.

Sporty Design is fantastic and It gives a very good comfort and safe riding experiences. Silencer and crystal clear indicators having a different look. Tail lamp is very sylish and led light are used which consumes lesser power and long life. Digital meter display is also very good and it also displays gear postion. The adjustable rear shock absorber gives stability for riding. It gives 40 plus milage which is good in the class. I am sure that bike lovers definitely love this suzuki gixxer sf,Gixxer
1320,This is best 150c sport bike because it got some serious feature that will make you conveince to buy it.,Gixxer
1321,"This is my 4th Bike & never have I ever seen such severe rusting issues. My Bajaj Pulsar parked in the open for 8+ years has intact fuel tank, while Gixxer is parked under covered parking. All my services till date have been done with Suzuki. Why did they not suggest or take timely action & waited till the metal completely rusted thru requiring tank replacement(not repair).",Gixxer

1324,This is perfect bike for daily use. If you are looking for alternative then honda hornet is the best competitor to this bike,Gixxer
1325,"This is petrol using machine, break type machine, wheel size 17 inches tubeless tyers so road grip is too good condition, sudden stop no rolling good grip condition.",Gixxer
1326,"This is super vehicle excellent The air-cooled, single-cylinder 155 cc engine is the same as the Gixxer too. The engine makes 14.6bhp and 14Nm of torque.",Gixxer
1327,"This is the best bike in this price.The looks of this is very impressive of this SF range.The colour combination is totally mixed up with the vinayl graphics and the silencer exhaust has a new double exhaust look, this is totally new innovation I think.And afterall L.E.D. finished tail lamp, digital dash board display with clock and gear engaged number display everything is great.",Gixxer

1334,"This powerplant is mated to a five-speed gearbox, unlike the six-speed one on the GS150R. The engineers have set the gear ratios really well throughout the rev range and we never felt the need of the sixth gear. Suzuki's intention of developing an optimised powertrain with the five-speed unit has worked well. But only if the company could have kept the first two gears short, the bike could have sprinted better than the naked, especially considering the fact that it is also a bit heavier than the naked model. However, the gear shifts on the Gixxer SF felt a bit hard when compared to the naked version.",Gixxer
1335,This product's design and layout is totally awesome. This product is completely different from other because of its lots of functions and features.,Gixxer
1336,This review is totally based upon my personal views. I have driven this motorcycle for over 900km and the performance of the small 150cc engine shocked me. The motorcycle is totally lightweight and is a pleasure in corners. This motorcycle is very useful in the track too as the motorcycle flicks between turns and the acceleration according to the 150cc engine is mind blowing. The colour variants are also good here. Cost of maintenance is low and the motorcycle has got a beautiful low-end torque which is useful in city traffic. Highly recommended for people trying to get them selves a first motorcycle.,Gixxer
1337,This suzuki gixxer bike is very good racing bike. the mileage of this bike is  good but not that much and its power engine is also good . this is high speed bike and comfortable to ride . the design of this is look gorgeous  and attracting look of this bike .the grip of the tire of this bike is also good and this bike is best for the bike rider and stunners and it is not so much heavy to ride for the youngsters. this is best bike for racing. 10/9 for this bike. lovable. fantastic.and well modified bike.,Gixxer
1338,"This thing put me in dilemma, because it was true that though the bike's look, power were great,  the mileage and quality was weak point.  Also the Pulsar's engine is quite old.",Gixxer
1339,This was my first impression and after that I fell in love with this bike.,Gixxer
1340,"Though it has some demerits.bhp is less, no cut handle, seating is not good and long rides dont make us comfortable.i dont get the mileage that suzuki offers but will get around 45 per litre. It is good for small rides and is the best available bike with 155cc under 1.2 lakh.",Gixxer
1341,"Though my bike is still new, it is giving me a good mileage. I ride in mixed conditions mostly and refuel once a week(5 litres of petrol), less than half of the fuel tank's capacity and still don't need to switch to Reserve mode. I hope you get the hint here.",Gixxer
1342,"Thus, this bike definitely outshines the Yamaha FZ and is undoubtely the king of the 150cc segment",Gixxer
1343,"To be honest I was not an issue in the first place with preload, but the bike was back once I load it with a back seat and have been victim speedbreakers. Not one to make a point of contact so Gixxer is solved. Yes, the ride is a bit stronger, but it is in no way offensive Gixxer and still runs like business as usual. And business is good.",Gixxer
1344,"To be honest, we’re always looking for an excuse to ride the Suzuki Gixxer in one form or another, and the recent launch of a new version of the SF, featuring fuel-injection and a rear disc brake was a good enough reason to take it out for a spin. The Gixxer, and by extension its fully faired version, the Gixxer SF, have been game-changing motorcycles in the 150cc segment. They’ve not just cemented the company’s position in this segment, but also set a new benchmark against which all other 150cc street bikes will be judged going forward. Without a doubt, the Gixxer is one of the best 150cc bikes you can buy today. So, does the inclusion of fuel injection in the SF variant make it even better?",Gixxer
1345,"To help this forum member and probably countless others seeking to learn more about their bikes, I'm supplying these definitions of terms used in typical motorcycle",Gixxer
1346,"To match the macho stance of the fully faired bike, Suzuki has used 140 section tyre at rear and the bike gets Y-shaped three spoke alloy wheels.",Gixxer
1347,Today I am going to tell about my personal experience on Suzuki Gixxer SF bike I bought this bike 6 months before this is a great bike to ride I am totally satisfied with the service of this bike.,Gixxer
1348,"Today I am reviewing  SUZUKI GIXXER SF so lets get started so guys firstly  we will talk about mileage of SUZUKI GIXXER it gives a mileage of 40kmpl which is good and in city riding it gives 35kmpl which is also good and overall performance of the bike is really awesome it's a lovely sports, racing and performance bike we can say that comfort of the bike is very good because of rear mono shock nitrox suspension and Front telescopic suspension which provides better comfort and we are very reliable to Suzuki road grip of the bike is very good because of company provided more grip tyres I appeal to all those who are looking to buy this bike they can go through it.",Gixxer
1349,Today I will review about a very and powerful bike Suzuki Gixxer SF. My classmate has this bike and riding this bike feels very comfortable and premium. This bike is beast with lots of power in it. It is a 150 cc bike with a fabulous look. It is launched with lots of improvement in its previous version that is Gixxer. Also the length of this bike has been increased from its earlier version.,Gixxer
1350,Today its one of the cheapl and best sell by suzuki.its maintanence is too low and it has a sudden pick up.though a wonderful bikes its got some isssues,Gixxer
1351,"Today we will talk about another sports bike, which is the suzuki company bike, whose name is GIXXER",Gixxer
1352,"Top speed is around 127kph. amazing vehicle.The Suzuki Gixxer SF is essentially the Gixxer with the addition of that fairing. The only other addition to the frame is the hardware needed to mount the fairing. In that sense, you cannot take the fairing off and turn an SF into a Gixxer or vice-versa. Other changes include the top triple clamp and the tip of the unique exhaust, both of which are unique to the SF.",Gixxer
1353,Tow seater bike is perfct nd dis bike touching on speed breaker .,Gixxer

1357,Under This Price There Is Not A Single Faired Bike You Would Get As Good Looking As This,Gixxer
1358,"Unfortunately, the throw of light is low and the intensity could have been better. It might not cause any problems at night in the city, but for the enthusiasts who would want to take the bike out on long tours, night travel will be a tough task. Coming to the usage of the mirrors, the nature is exactly opposite to the usage of the headlight. The mirrors do provide a perfect sight and are stable on the highway, but are too wide making it difficult for the bike to pass between two vehicles in the city traffic with ease. Nevertheless, if it seems to be a hindrance, Suzuki has given users an option of fitting mirrors on the handle-bar like the naked Gixxer.",Gixxer
1359,Unlike r15 the seat is so comfortable.I would honestly insist you to buy the suzuki gixxer sf rather than buying r15.,Gixxer
1360,Unsure of the equipment list we can hope for the GSX-R250 to be more of a track oriented motorcycle which can be used for commuting purposes as well. Unlike Suzuki’s Gixxer 155-SF which focused on being a commuter motorcycle with a few bits of a sports bike.,Gixxer

1365,Very good bike. Superb mileage. I got 55 kmpl average. Pickup is best. Suspension is very heavy so we do not get jurk. Very stylish look. Dual disk break is also very nice . Digital meter consol is best I like it very much. Rear wheel size is big so we get better grip on the road. Fully fairing is the best. I like it very much.,Gixxer

1374,"We do wish the engine could have revved higher for more top end grunt, but then again, the Gixxer SF is not an outright track machine. The full fairing might suggest otherwise, but the SF is more set for touring than devouring a racetrack. The Gixxer is an agile motorcycle, and the addition of a fairing doesn’t change anything. The SF negotiates corners like its naked twin. Simply put – pick your racing line, and the bike will follow your inputs seamlessly though a corner. Though the bike feels stable at high speeds the motor sounds stressed at these points. The ride is a tad stiff, but if you can adjust the preload on the rear monoshock – which has seven different settings – to make the ride softer.",Gixxer
1375,We will get back pain in just 30 mis from starting of ride. plz try to improve ur rates and comfort suzukiii .and also make the side stands as correctly . coz when we park the bike it will make us the bike ill fell down like thaughts plz try to improve this complaints and price adjustments and all .,Gixxer
1376,Welcome to mouthshut.com This is review for a bike of suzuki .,Gixxer
1377,"Well I have been in the pillion seat as well, we could feel the guttors",Gixxer
1378,Well Not Only Fuel Efficiency Is Great But The Seats Are Soft and The Sitting Position Is Very Comfortable Too,Gixxer
1379,"Well This bike is one of the best for beginners, It can give a mileage up to 37 to 41kmpl.Its really a comfortable bike in it's class it's riding posture is excellent for highway and city ride's.yes, its a very reliable bike, it's engine is very smooth and gearing also, Handling is very decent in city as well as while cornering, Yes it's a beginners bike it great and can be control it's 155 cc engine is very smooth and anyone can control it, It's looks are a little bit like hayabusa it's noticeable due to it's bright colour",Gixxer
1380,Well for all of bike lovers looks are of great importance and for majority looks are the most important thing. And for them what else other than a fully faired moto gp edition blue motorbike will please their eyes. Suzuki has ticked the right boxes with the launch of gixxer and with sf now they also ticked the dreams of an average Indian biker to own a fully faired sports looking motorcycle Well to talk about the handling the bike is a leap ahead of gixxer which itself was best around the corners. The added weight of the fairing gives the front end much planted feel in corners and communicates excellent with the rider inputs. Well the large chunky section mrf tyres and beefy forks and stable chassis gives its excellent dynamics. So go for an sf even if style isn't your only priority,Gixxer
1381,"Well for now suzuki comes into the compition of local area bikes like pulsar, hero, honda etc. Actually suzuki is a racing bike company and we all know it its racing bikes are out of our budget but dont worry this bike of suzuki will completely make you feel riding a racing bike. well u can see its look and that is amazing much like hayabusa bike of suzuki but its comfort is totally amazing, so looks are good lets talk about its power, with 155cc this bike has amazing pickup and u can compare its pickup with pulsar 180 both are same, the most amazing thing is its sound like an amazing racing bike. now the actual mileage of bike is 50km/litre and this is true . if u are waiting to impress anyone then this bike will surely help you and it is in your budget. GO FOR IT.",Gixxer
1382,Well padded seat and super suspension shocker feel you comfort in riding and any road condition.,Gixxer
1383,"Wheel Base of this is 1, 330 mm. nice Ground Clearance of160 mm.Seat Height is780 mm. comfortable for both driver and the person seating behind. price of bike is approximately 88 thousand with the warranty of 2 years. it is most awarded bike in year 2015. good mileage of 56 kmpl. nice style good chassis developed by engineers . good value for nice bike for a common man in budget bike.",Gixxer
1384,When I  test to the bike up to  135 kilometre per second speed .Engine has a greater efficiency to create a maximum power and maximum torque in very less time.,Gixxer
1385,When I am riding it its so much comfortable for me it has good milage its look like sports bike I like this soo much.,Gixxer
1386,When I got it as new bike the mileage was upto 46 when I checked. but the moment they put their hands in first service the mileage dropped down to 38kmpl till now even after 8k km in the odo.,Gixxer
1387,"When I heared about gixxer SF from my friends, then I go to the showroom, Then I take full information about it, then take a test drive, I fell awesome. I like the digital gear display, handling, controling etc.I love the sound of engine. Only one think I dislike that, I dond like this types of silencer.! Althrough the bike is awesome. I definetly recomanded to all guys, you should be bye this bike.",Gixxer
1388,"When I m going to start Collage every body coming New New bike high cost bike .l am a middle class family . One day Suzuki lunch in this Suzuki Gixxer SF lowest price full vizier . This bike looking so sexy, oms looks, good handling, super millage but this bike pick up to good . Any road very good handling speed are staring handling nice . Two people are seating easy . Any girls are like so much . Specially Thanks who digging this bike and and specially thanks in Suzuki Company .",Gixxer
1389,When I saw some pros of gixxer is good efficiency and has a abs system.,Gixxer
1390,When I see this bike I only captured a image of dream bike which is so attractive by looks and the colour which the invented is so attractive make eyes stay on it . the best part this bike is it is fuel efficient and confort of riding in a rushy area handling and controls are supurb with the best highly equiped and get so much of equivalent.,Gixxer
1391,"When I shift the Gear from 1st to 2nd, its not going to 2nd gear. Its going to neutral.",Gixxer
1392,"When Suzuki had launched the Gixxer, they had made it clear that this 155cc engine is not a unit that the company shares with the commuter centric GS150R motorcycle. The engine is new and comes equipped with SEP(Suzuki Eco Performance) technology, which will help the motorcycle deliver both performance as well as fuel efficiency.",Gixxer
1393,"When Suzuki launches its Gixxer series in market, everyone is expecting that this series may be astounding but the reality shrouded behind its looks. The rendition of Suzuki Gixxer SF is like a Firebrand sports bike although there are some new innovation like aerodynamic drag reduction and aluminium mufler which is not used before in street bikes. but still this bike is giving the appropriate power, in 155cc engine it is still giving 14PS powe and 14Nm torque. Suzuki has to know about that the liquid cooled engine gives little bit more power than the air cooled engine. in the price range of 89-92k it is average option. Top speed of this bike Reveal by company is about 127kmph and fuel efficiency is 40-50kmpl.",Gixxer
1394,When im riding on this bike I complately feel sporty. I got 45kmpl avg Its a very good for me and in this bike 150cc angine so pickup is also very good of this bike. In this bike break is disc. When I buy this bike suzuki giving me free services and I satisfy with company free service because her service is very good. So I would recommand for this bike.,Gixxer
1395,"When it comes to long rides, this bike is more likely to spell disaster with it's naturally cool engine. Not really cool, Yamaha -_-",Gixxer
1396,"When u talk about looks the gixxer sf is the best bike the blue bike black seat yello with black tyres so the gixxer sf is the best bike for collage boys handling is assome comfort is best seat is full os sponge and fuel is tank is best the bettal, dis break awesome bike bro all and its realty it`s my dream bike my all frinds took this bike soo and ones again the looks soo nice control is best the bike is best. thanks",Gixxer
1397,"When we hear about suzuki, the first name come into our mind is of suzuki hayabusa, but everyone cannot afford one.",Gixxer
1398,"When we talk about the 'look' bikes, this bike is cool accordingding to me. When we talk about look it simply can challange the yamaha sports bikes in 150cc range. The sky blue colour is awsome on road.and gives a good look compare to other colour preference. Having 155cc engine it give nic pick-up and racing kick.",Gixxer
1399,"When you are riding on gixxer sf, almost every eye catches you even kids and uncles hehe. So this is a unique bike as people are aware from yamaha R15, Yamaha FZ, KTM'S,",Gixxer
1400,While driving its controls are very good it will not get disbalanced easily,Gixxer
1401,While using this bike I didn't faced any problem like manufacture defects. The side mirrors are quit broad so you may face challenges while riding on small street. If you ask me to give rating on the look of the bike then I would definitely give full rating. One more thing is that it's price is not too much. It is affordable.,Gixxer
1402,With a great outlook the all new stylish bike is with all newly added features . It runs lengthy on roads or has a good mileage . It has a very good road grip It can raise  upto an easy top speed of 120 kmph and also has better acceleration . it is quite pretty comfortable.,Gixxer
1403,With all it ergo's which not only suits the urban traffic bt also able to cruse at highway  with an ease!Suzuki gixxer sf's strong point is its low end torque which is ample to leave the traffic far away from you.What I mainly like about Suzuki gixxer sf is its exceptional grip on the road.,Gixxer
1404,With its all new 4 valve  engine it is  more fuel saving as well high accelerated bike . this bike is quite appealing . I would recommend it.,Gixxer
1405,With pillion I used to get aprox35 to 38kmpl sometimes and with out pillion I get 40 to 42 kmpl,Gixxer
1406,"With the success of Gixxer 155-SF, it won’t take much long for Suzuki to step up the game to entry level sportsbikes with their Gixxer 250.",Gixxer
1407,Wonder full bike stylish good in seating for long drive mono suspension power full good mileage good sound firing tail light is very good looking front look ow some  you will love that bike sport lover or low budget macho man should have bike.,Gixxer
1408,Wonderfully made machine by suzuki 155cc with fuelinjector.its has nice sitting posture.im using it since 1.6 years and getting a powerful response from the machine. Its afordable machine for every one. Its stylish design bold in looks amazing performance and fule economy is great . Can go for long rides without any ache. If one is planning can go for suzuki gixxer sf. High performance and services after sales are amazing. Go for it if you are planing,Gixxer
1409,Wow.its an awesome bike.in india to get a sporty look bike in low cost this is best.it has a very good handling and tyre grip is very good.the top speed can be achived is 131km/hr.millage is gud if u drive 60-70 speed.over all average it gives of 40km/liter.the speedo meter is awesome and colour is best.just love my bike.one more thing about handling it is very good.even at 120 speed I take very sharpe turns it will be perfect.the only problem is that the bike gets off when it hits its top speed while leaving the accelerator.but by increasing fueling u can overcome this proble.rest every thing is perfect.,Gixxer
1410,YAMAHA was the first to fuel India's obsession with its revolutinary track of YZF R15 in 2008 and this time SUZUKI is walking the revolutionary track with the hope of repeating history with its newly launched GIXER SF. The only fully faired motorcycle in the 150cc segment under 1 lakh. The Sf doesnot requires any fuel injection or liquid cooling.,Gixxer
1411,Yamaha is also a very nice brand name but FZ is costly than this bike but in any case this is better than Fz.,Gixxer
1412,Yamaha is fun to ride but Suzuki Gixxer Fi is Comfortable in Driving.,Gixxer
1413,"Yamaha was the first company in India which introduce a fully fared 150cc motorcycle and Suzuki follows the same way but with different approach. This is the cheapest fully fared motorcycle in India and also this is not a fuel injected bike. The looks of the bike is no doubt one of the best under 1lac rupees with feature loaded instrument cluster. This bike is except the fairing same as its naked sibling, Gixxer which is not bad at all as Gixxer is a great bike. Gixxer Sf offers almost same mileage, performance, ride and handling as the Gixxer which are by far the best in segment along with more top speed on tap. So, if anyone wants to flaunt but has tight budget then nothing beats the Gixxer Sf.",Gixxer
1414,Ye bike jo hai bahut dikhne me achcji hai aur is modification bahu acheche se ki ye bike jab riad par chalti hai to public to chalane wale ko kam bike jyada dekhte hai ue bike dosto aap logo bho lena chahiye kyunki ye chalane me maza aata hai aur agar aap ki koi girl friend hai to phir to aur maza ayega kyunki jab bike chalate ho aur breaker ata hai ua khadda ata hai aur break marte ho to girl friend aapki aap ke baho me hoki so ok dosto must buy this bike ok thanks.,Gixxer
1415,Yeah and for this price I am pretty satisfied about everything else other than the seat cussion,Gixxer
1416,Yes I am talking about all new GIXXER SF. I am a proud owner of gixxer. It is true that it isnt soo fast like r15 or duke. But it is also true that it is much more cheaper than this bike. So if I have a budget ranging between 90000 to 100000. So its the only fared bike. I bought a gixxer sf for 97000 rs final price on road pcmc rto. My parents had an issue with fast bikes so they were like no fast bikes u should buy. When the gixxer sf launched we had a test drive and it was incredible unique in handling and in mileage it is also true that it does not perform well if ur racing but it is so fast that there is no 150 cc bike which can compete with gixxer excluding r15. With the top speed of 130 my personal best. I feel it is more than sufficient for a bike in this category. And the body is so best at its aerodynamic that it dosnt have any vibration at top speed no air drag as well. I dislike about this bike is that it has a potential of a 6th gear which isnt present. You reach 5th gear so early and u feel like changing the gear and ur like this is the last gear so it is really disappointing. Popping a willi or a stoppie is so easy. Anyone having more budget and is a speedster should surely switch to duke.,Gixxer
1417,"Yes it is sporty, the aerodynamic fairing does a great job in wind deflection which helps in cruising at high speeds effortlessly. When attacking a corner, the bike gracefully handles it as if it knows what is coming and immediately if we ride out of a corner, the bike rolls less gas and that is the throttle response that offers. You do not want to lessen a gear, go hard on gas, rev up to over take a vehicle. With a twist of throttle you can see the traffic getting vanished through your rear view mirrors.",Gixxer
1418,Yes rided on Suzuki Gixxer SF which my friend had bought 3 months ago but I was not satisfied with this bike because its seat was not that much comfortable. This bike's headlights are very dull as its light reflection capacity is zero.,Gixxer
1419,"Yes suzuki released gixer in 150cc segement and got failure due to performance of this bike is very worst that it can't get good pickup as it gives pickup like 125cc bike and design is looking like sport bike all are make from fibre and there is no safety in this bike that if any thing happens nothing is there bcoz all are fiber, giving good milage is not a good bike, by seeing realiblity on road it seems some what better and main thing is you not feeling any riding experience as sport bike only design is like that, it costs around one lakh five thousands and resale value is only 40, 000.has very bad resale value.",Gixxer
1420,Yo the suzuki gixxer sf the best bike. The best ever. It is very good bike for the sport. It has great features inside it. It is at top among all bikes. It is speedometer attracts every person. It's millage is also good then other sports bike. And model of 2017 is better than otjer model. Suzuki has given best tyres. So it's road grip is very much good. We can take turn also in anyway. So grip of tyres is good and tyre are smooth. It has good sitting given by company. Two person can sit on it. It has smooth and soft sit. So we can use it for long drive. It has also good reliability. It has two cylencer. It has led light. It has look like bike named Hya Buza. So I appeal all buyers to buy this bike only not other bike. Because it is very good and also comes in less price also it is very good in comparison with other bikes,Gixxer
1421,"You can buy this bike ONLy 83, 459 INR.this is realy a low prize for this bike because this bike have many intersting featuer.",Gixxer
1422,"You can get many better bikes at that price range like avenger, apache, pulsur as 200, 180 , etc.",Gixxer
1423,You can trust suzuki blindly because son cant teach father how to shave in other words nobody can teach the suzuki how to make a bike they are professionals all bike which is used in moto gp is made by suzuki so you can trust it blindly they never cheats your trust.,Gixxer
1424,"You cannot specify resulting indicators if the result field is an array; you can specify them if it is an array element, or a nonarray field.",Gixxer
1425,You get a disc brake and also the PICK up of the bike is fantastic.It is better than,Gixxer
1426,"You guys need to work more on it . I will recommend the fi version , it is still ok but the SF is according to me a waste of money .",Gixxer
1427,"You'll have a hard time riding with a passenger, it's going to be very slow if you do",Gixxer
1428,"Your bikes goods;  very so nice   review title will attract readers so be creative.   100 characters may not be needed if all you intend to do is to say that you enjoyed the meal, or that it was a good restaurant, but such reviews are worthless(and sadly we get too many of them).

Talking fuel efficiency in context its most fuel efficient bike in faired 150 cc sports bike segment. taking about comfort it has a sporty ergonomics with handle bar which is only a drawback,as it doest have fux or clip on handle .

1445,but its looks erotic hyper series bike its blue colour I love it,Gixxer

1462,hahahahahah awsome gorgeous nice beautifull look like dashing fablous byc,Gixxer
1463,"he SF with Fi is powered by the same 155 cc engine that does duty in the Gixxer motorcycle. Since Suzuki hasn't stated just how much the power and torque has increased, thanks to fuel-injection, we reckon it is marginal. This move comes in at the right time for Suzuki as the Indian government has decided to impose stricter emission norms for two wheelers which requires newly launched bikes to comply to BSIV norms by April 2016. This works quite well in Suzuki's favour as the new Fi system should bring down the CO2 emissions by quite a margin.",Gixxer
1464,"he new fairing is in line with the elegant seat and the upswept tail piece, not giving a feeling that the fairing was an afterthought. Then of course, the large oval-shaped dual exhaust with aluminium muffler cover adds to the bling. The Y shape, three-spoke alloys from the Gixxer make it the best looking alloys in this segment. Not to upset fans and enthusiasts with skinny tyres, the Gixxer SF’s wheels are shod with a 140 section tyre at the back, which gives it a good street presence.",Gixxer
1465,"he thing about fully-faired motorcycles is that they are easily noticeable due to the large panels that cover the engine and extend till the headlamp. Some motorcycles look really good, while some not so much with the additional unnecessary mass.

1496,"lets talk about the bike now: I have crossed 700 km now waiting for my first service, till the first service I have been asked to ride the bike below 4500 rpm which I think I m adhering the rule, so far bike is good in pickup, didn't check about mileage but I guess its giving me somewhere around 45kmpl, as its a new bike engine is not as refined as what u expect but its negligible and gear shifting is bit hard(hope these two issues of refinement & smooth gear shifting will short out after first service), I love the way this bike holds the road, I recently got saved by this bike because of its bulky MRF tyres, I was at 45-48kmph speed and due to a very bad pothole I applied a sudden break, my rear tire did slip a bit but nothing happened to the bike, it slipped and I changed the gear from 5th to 1st quickly then ran again in 1st gear, so for handling I will give it 10/10, looks is awesome, pillion seat is a bit hard if pillion is for more than 20 minutes, bike is running good, so far no problem and hope this bike last for 3 years without any problem.",Gixxer

1537,the people who are wanting to have more power and a better pick up I would tell you to wait as it cannot give enough power and the pickup in the 1st gear is slow compared to a yamaha r15. yes the comfort level is much more but the feeling of speed is not there. if the company launches the 250cc version of this bike in India you should buy that. And also there is no ABS in the bike so use that front brake carefully.,Gixxer

1,"Okay let me start my review with my buying experience. I was looking for a 200 cc bike or a bit higher and my budget was under 200k at the time my choices was re thunderbird and rs 200 cause they are cheap and i personally like the unique looks the bikes has to offer. At the time sf 250 was priced at 2006000 in my state, but i got it for 192000 as they were clearing out bs4 models.First ride was amazing i instantly fell in love with the looks and the ride comfort, its sporty but not as sporty as r15 and very stable you wont feel the bike wobble at all trust me on this. Also a point to add is the suzuki easy start system its a big plus.The looks sf 250 has is truly different and unique (also its not a common bike as the re in kerala, everyone is riding re here nowadays) so i really like the attention my bike draws in.The first free service at 300km cost me around rs.900 with including chain lube, oil change and washing etc.Two cons i can say is that1. The side stand is pretty straight compared to other bikes so be careful while parking on a slight sloping ground. 2. And all the spare parts are not readily available. When my cousin dropped my new bike just 2 days after i got it, i was shattered i thought the faring was gone. But honestly there was only a scratch on the faring that too on the sticker but the mirror and clutch lever broke. The service center guys was very calm and supportive about it they ordered the parts and replaced it. (took around 1 week for the parts to get here that's one of the cons i mentioned).All in all a good bike very study and comfortable 10/10 suzuki.",Gixxer_250
2,"All the issue that i addressed in my first review still not cleared completely. Now i ridden this bike around 7k km completed ""3"" services.At 4k km,the showroom finds that it was the faulty 'O'-ring(but not) in the gear box that makes the gearing issue(but one of friends workshop told me that it is the gear selector issue).but the factory warranty, i ended up giving my bike in the showroom and take a week to repair.They changed the ""O"" ring only. Once i got the bike after repair found that the clutch became hard and a tight feel from the engine while throttling.But the issue is still there though and found that this is common issue for the gixxer series so many of my friends are reported this gearing issue as well as the oil leak issue from the engine. The first oil leak came at 3500km from engine head,after ridding 3k km oil leak came back from  same spot at 6500km. At the the time 3rd service was done,but the engine head gasket wasn't changed they just tightened it because they don't have the gasket it was out of stock.I can still see the wet surface on my engine head.....I decided it was my last visit to suzuki service and i won't bring back my bike to suzuki service centre. So i decided to do my upcoming services and repair from local workshops.....",Gixxer_250
3,"Buying experience- never buy bike from rock suzuki byculla/ mahim, they not handling client properly & poor service Riding experience- bike is so much amazing for cruising on highway & very comfortable but not good for traffic condition Pros- premium looks, no heating issues, bike runs very smoothly, easy to overtakes, Cons- slipper clutch missing, headlight throw is not that much efficient, small digital meter, parts not available at workshop, price little high  Servicing and maintenance- pocket friendly (mark suzuki sion-  good service experience).",Gixxer_250
4,"You will feel special when you ride this machine. It has nice riding position compared to other full faired bikes available in India in that price range. Mileage is good for its engine.. I am getting average of 35-40 depend on riding condition, as i ride in extreme speed. I have touched a maximum of 148km/hr with this bike. It's performance and pick up is smooth. Maintenance cost is not that high, as the regular service cost me around 1000rs/- in service centre. Have a test drive and i assure you will feel like buying it.I just feel a bit disappointed by its exhaust sound and horn could have been a bit more louder to suit its looks and design.",Gixxer_250
5,Pros:1. It has a rev happy butter smooth engine.2. The range and visibility of the led head lights are great.3. The sitting posture is not too aggressive and it is good for commuting as well.4. Fit and finish of the bike is excellent.5. It is well stable at the high speeds.6. The socs works well both at high ways as well as in bumper to bumper city traffic's.Cons:1. It would have get a better brakes.2. It misses out slipper clutch.3.Feeling a little buzz in seats while revving upto the redline. 4. Pillion seat is less accessible for ladies.,Gixxer_250
6,"1.My dream bike gixxer sf 250 when got delivery, i was so excited to ride my first new bike. i love the bike too. 2.Riding comfort. Suzuki gixxer riding comfort was awesome, performance is been stable, easy control giving confidence for a rider 3. Look was so awesome, i love that look and pretty good 4.Servicing and maintenance that was awesome.",Gixxer_250
7,"Buying experienceI bought this bike on march 2022 from malappuram suzuki showroom in kerala. I got it for 218000 on road. I choose the bike delivered in the showroom 2 days back, with a manufacturing date within a month (to avoid getting possibly misused bike). The delivery experience was really nice.Riding experienceIt is a perfect bike for those who want just one bike for both daily, and city use and for weekly touring. It has decent low-end torque which makes it easy to ride in cities. Just release the clutch in first gear, and the bike will go at 12 kmph speed without touching the accelerator (in 2nd gear, at 18 kmph). It has good ground clearance, so coupled with good low-end torque helps in handling mild off-roads as well. On the highway, you can tour all day at 90 to 120 kmph without any vibrations. After 120, you'll feel little vibes in the foot pegs and seats, and it can reach up to 154 kmph at which the rpm limiter kicks in. The seating position is very comfortable for a sports bike, so long-distance touring is not an issue.Looks, performance, etc.It looks superb from the sides and back. I'm not a great fan of its front design as it is a little lowered (inspired from katana's design). But if you put on a tall visor, this problem might get solved. The headlight is very good. Even low beam gives you good visibility. The performance is very decent, and you'll be able to beat most vehicles in the road in terms of acceleration. I tested its mileage multiple times, and i always got in the range of 38 to 41. For me, it has the perfect balance between performance and mileage.Servicing and maintenanceIt is the cheapest 250cc to maintain. As it is the only bike with a fully oil-cooled system (let me tell you, it is suzuki's patented technology, and even better than many liquid cooling systems found in other bikes in this segment), there is no need for coolant, and no oil-coolant mixing issue (very common in ktms and bajaj).  It cost me around 1100 rupees for 1st service and less than 900 rupees for the second service.Pros and consDefinitely, the pros outweigh the cons. I already mentioned every major pro. Now coming to the cons. It's wind visor is too small, but you can find many after-market options (rr310's visor is a good option). Being a sohc engine, there is a little bit of vibration at higher rpms (above 6-7k), but not a big issue (i think only those used to honda and yamaha bikes will notice this). Gear shift is precise, but a little hard (but you won't notice it if you use good footwear). Back seat is comfortable but positioned a little higher, so climbing is a little difficult.  Conclusion -> it is a seriously underrated machine. I'd say you must take a test ride of this beast if you're planning to buy a bike under 2.5 lakhs.",Gixxer_250
8,"This bike is superb in terms of:1. Built quality2. Engine performance3. Ride comfort4. Milage.5. design in addition to above noted few more things as The design is very eye catchy and u will be first among while accelerating from a signal. The engine has enough grunt and punches in all gears and rpm. The headlight throw is pretty enough. The disadvantage i felt was the visor is not purposeful, but can be replaced with jb visor or any other from the aftermarket. This is one of the best 250 bikes with no heating issues and can be used for daily commuting and touring as well.",Gixxer_250
9,"It is a brilliant bike. Which is more versatile. Handles city duties, touring really well. Suspension setup is brilliant. You can scrape your footpaces. Looks are super cool. Better than any bike in this segment. Rather spending 2 Lakh on a metal vibrators from Royal Enfield  get this gem. You will certainly not get disappointed.",Gixxer_250

11,"Hello. I bought my Gixxer SF 250 matt black on October 2020 from bangalore Meghdooth motors. The buying experience was very good. I decided to go with SF 250 mainly because of the riding comfort (not too dynamic and not very upright also) considering its a sports tourer and i wanted a faired motorcycle. Pros-Good power delivery, loved the design, definite attention grabber on the road mileage city- 35, highway-37.5Comfortable riding posture, stable at 145km with pillion Cons:-Back breaks could have had better bite, not the most effective wind blast at 110+Pilion comfort is good, but not suitable for long rides, no issue faced till now 4000 km. ",Gixxer_250
12,I am telling all you guys to just purchase this bike. I have experience of this bike and it has double exhaust. The power is amazing. It does not vibrate. The seat is amazing. You all will feel very comfortable. Just buy this Suzuki bike and tell your friends also to but this bike. It is a good bike in a budget of 1 lakh 50 thousand.  It really good in looks.,Gixxer_250
13,"It's a quality product in the 250cc category. Suzuki has blended performance, styling, ease of maintenance, and usability in the right mix.The bike can be used daily for commuting and for occasional long rides. It seldom feels cumbersome & gives you riding pleasure from a great engine. I would vouch for the gixxer sf 250 anyday of you're looking for that right balance of performance, economy & comfort.Cheers!",Gixxer_250
14,1. Buying experience was very good.2. Riding experience is upto the mark. In highway it is very much stable to clock triple digits speed. But in city it feels slightly on the heavier side when you filter through city traffic.3. The 249.3 cc motor that pack with power and mileage. In this premium quarter-liter segment who are looking for a all rounder package here's the search end. On highways it can easily maintain triple digits speed with a decent mileage. And look wise it's a head turner machine. When I ride this machine everyone makes a look on it. I have the suzuki 100th year anniversary moto gp colour scheme. For that this bike looks like a big bike. 4. But here i little disappointed. Suzuki's spare parts are not easily available in the market. You find spare parts most of the time but sometimes you have to wait for spares. But maintenance is too cheap. I just did the 1st service with a 1400 rs bill. I used Castrol power 1 ultimate 20w50 for my motorcycle.5. Pros:• looks are the up to the mark.• performance  is enough for your all rounder performance.• braking are superb and handling on a stiffer side that decrease your comfort but increase your handling with a dual channel abs set up.Cons:• missed out led indicator.• little windscreen is not helps much when you are on highway.• assist and slipper clutch are missed out.,Gixxer_250
15,"Well i am the 1st buyer of SF250 moto gp in my state. There is no better bike than sf 250 in the quarter litre sport bike segment. This bike is solely responsible for uprooting Honda cbr from the Indian market. As i have owned a cbr 250 also, I can easily say SF 250 is much better. The engine is smoother and more refined, looks much better than CBR n KTM RCs which look too bad after the bs6 update. Only R15 v3 is close to the looks but v3 is ridiculously expensive as a 150 cc bike.Coming to the performance, it is gonna be 2 years now from the date of purchase and this bike never had any major or minor breakdown apart from the battery issue in lockdown. It can be easily used for your daily city rides. With a ground clearance of 165 mm, it absorbs the bumps smoothly. On a track or even on highway, u can touch 150 easily on the speedometer. I have even gone to the beach side of my state riding it for 4 hours and have not felt any pain. With the stock tyres of MRF revz, it is the best bike as RCs also come with the same stock tyre now after the bs6 update and R15 v3 and even Ninja 300 have MRF zappers as stock tyres which will last for hardly 2 years. The only bike better than it is RR 310 which has become a dream bike after the bs6 update but the only reason I didn't buy it was the unavailability of the blue colour. Finally, I must conclude that my biggest satisfaction came when my mom could sit on the sf 250 comfortably that she could never do on the cbr for 6 yrs.",Gixxer_250

Then they did the paperwork and docs whilst I waited and then the bike was delivered.     Now i cranked the bike for the first time and i was not impressed at all because the vibrations were quite a lot more than what I've thought would be. I was wandering weather this was a bike from the recalled ones due to the improper balancer gear position thing but for my good, it was not. Then I started riding it to my home and it was quite a good experience altogether. The suspension was quite stiff and the feel of the motorcycle felt like something else (awesome) that I never worried about the vibrations during the drive. The headlights were super purposeful and the gears were quite precise and not that much hard as of said in few reviews.    The performance was not extraordinary or something of that sort but was sufficient (not as crazy as the KTM ones). The front brakes were good enough but the rear ones are pretty pathetic. But combining both it'll stop at your command. Since i rode it home when it was rainy I felt quite a bit of moist warmth coming from the fairing but there's absolutely nothing to worry since this motorcycle does not heat up that much.      The handling is not as good as the r15 but is pretty decent at best.     I've ridden around 160 kms as of now and a noise started around the clutch area of the gearbox. The noise stays when the bike is in neutral and idling but when I depress the clutch the noise goes away. I don't know why this happens to a brand new motorcycle. Have to check with the service centre yet. The looks are the one which made me love this machine. Lets wait and see how far and long this bike can hold.",Gixxer_250
18,"1) Dream bike, just test drive and bought without any confusions.2) loved it, it makes the city ride enjoyable.3) Have great road presence, superb performance.4) Decent service cost.5) Pros- comfortable sitting posture, great mileage, beautiful looks, enough power.     Cons- horn doesn't suit bike worst",Gixxer_250
19,"I bought it from Shiv Suzuki. They delivered me the bike in 1 week after all paperwork and payment. It was a hassle-free experience from shiv suzuki.Before coming to the decision of buying gixxer sf250, I tested r15 v3 and pulsar rs200, though I liked yamaha for their engine smoothness and ride quality,  I was not impressed with the overall dimensions of R15 v3, it hurt my back like hell. It might be the physical limitation considering my height (5""8) and I was not keen to buy RS200 either considering Bajaj's long term cost of ownership. Initially, my plan was to buy 150SF but when I saw 250SF in the showroom with matt black finish I was blown away by its looks. Even today you won't go unnoticed riding on this in public. Performance-wise it's a really a smooth bike, I have been using it for almost a year and haven't faced any issue while doing so. My daily running is 35 kms which I cover almost within 0.8-0.9 liter of petrol. The engine is calibrated powerfully  yet economical considering the 250 cc capacity of the bike. I go up to the speed of 100 km/h without feeling the windblast but post that you can feel the vibration in the engine but anyways who goes post 100 km/h on indian roads. Another issue that I feel with suzuki is hardness in gear shifting I have driven apache 300 and re classic 500 cc but that didn't feel this hard like 250cc. I have cut off 1* only for that (consider it as 4.5) For free service, suzuki charges 900 Rs for an oil change but I think it should be free of cost for the first 3 services. Pros: riding comfort, ride quality, performanceCons: hard gear shifting",Gixxer_250
20,"I went to buy r15 initially and find it very uncomfortable and for 155cc bike i didn't want to spend that much amount, so thought to check on gixxer sf250. Fell in love on the very first glance with silver triton colour. I've booked the bike in the noon and delivered in the evening.Riding experience: bike performance was very smooth and seating position for rider was very comfortable. I went on a road trip for 300 kms recently, till 200kms on a single go I didn't find any problem with seating. I've done a top speed of 151 kmph on express highway and bike was very smooth till 120 km/h and pickup was very good. Easy to control and easy to maintain. In city I used to get mileage of 35 km/l and on highway I've got approx. of 33 km/l because of speed factor where I've constantly driven over 130 kmph over an period of 90 minutes.Pros : good looking, very comfortable, mileage, maintenance, pickup, smoothness, controlling.Cons : instrument cluster is very basic, horn sound is like scooty, bit noisy on gears shifting, rear brake could be better, visor could be little big bigger,",Gixxer_250
21,"The bike as once Varun painter from power drift put it, is very good at everything, but lacks that soul connection with the rider. And he is partly true. The bike looks good mostly and the mileage is great at almost 40 km/l when ridden sensibly in city, 45 km/l on highways within legal speeds, with the stupendous fast race to top speed available at all times. Running costs including service costs, parts are not expensive compared to peers. Comfort is not a problem unless you are in sticky traffic when the clutch hand will start to pain. This brings to the fault with this bike, at this price slipper clutch should have been there.Now when I said Varun painter was partly correct, its because the bike, while it has a soul, it comes alive after 5.5k rpm and to have fun, you need to keep it above 5000 rpm in lower gears while negotiating city traffic, it's fun but risky!You are doing 75 km/h at 5000 rpm in 6th gear. At 6000rpm its 90 km/h and its pretty fast. But the urge to give a bit of throttle is always there, for the exhaust sounds sweeter. Even more so when an underpass, or tunnel comes. And you may not want to quickly exit those underground parking lots, enjoying that angry, sharp exhaust note.So for daily commutes, they will be normal for the most part, relatively quiet and comfortable, but faster than the normal 150cc crowd without even making an effort. And if you want to have some thrills, it comes after 5000 rpm for some spirited riding, all along with howls and burbles of the twin barrel exhaust.It's very practical within limits, but that's just your sensible enough.",Gixxer_250
22,My buying experience of this bike is like I was too excited for this bike because in Lucknow my 250sf was the first or second bs6 sf250.2. Bike is too smooth and has a feather fine and refined engine it cruises like a tourer and has a speed of 157 kmph and shoots like a sports bike.A pure all-rounder for everyone I guess.3. In love with its tail section single-piece fenders and those macho tyre of 150/60 R17 section. The front feels like sharp as a shark and a bit like a raven mighty and bulked up 4. Maintenance cost is on the higher side but once maintained then you don't have to worry about anything.5. Could get a bigger display  . A taller visor to cut off all the windblast.  . The handlebar was set at a higher level than any sports bike.Pro's  . Has a refined engine    Has the best mid torque   . And has an ample amount of power and torque in this segment.,Gixxer_250
23,"Its a perfect all rounder bike for younger generation, I own 2 gixxer sf250 in the family. The refinement is in par or better compared to yamaha or honda 250 cc bikes. I would suggest to be careful during the first 2.5-3k kilometers to limit the speed under 80 km/h. I know it is frustrating but the magic happens once the unofficial break-in period is over.This pickup is very mature and reached 100 in no time, I would recommend to use on straight highways, city riding may be painful for taller riders due to the aggressive position.The mileage is around -35 to 40 km/l 4 valve dohc engine, to summarize if you are short or medium height, under 35 years of age , and an all-rounder bike and do not plan to change for the next 15 years, this bike is for you.",Gixxer_250
24,"I was first going to buy fz25, but decided to go for this bike instead because whatever the fz25 lacks in, gixxer 250 makes up for it. I wanted to go for the naked version first but when i saw the faired sf 250, i was sold! the bike is beautiful to look at in person. The build quality of plastics is really good and so is the overall fit and finish of the bike. Even the engine is amazing and exhaust has a soft bossy grunt to it. The 250cc gixxer are a bit sporty to ride too, as in you'll have to lean a bit forward to hold the handle. So if you're not riding it correctly, you will start feeling pain in your wrists and shoulders. The naked version has a slightly more raised handlebars then the faired one. But the posture is comfortable and both these bikes will do well for long rides too. They are very easy to use in the city as well. The only major downside to this bike is that the paint quality is poor when you shine a light to look at the bike chassis, the models i saw in the showroom had paint chipping off from the welded portions of the frame and rust had to started to form on it too. Even the saree guard had rust forming on it. And this for the 3 bikes i saw in the showroom, they were just 4 months old bikes. Even some owners have reported rusting issues with these bikes. That is the only thing making me a bit hesitant to buy it, cause when we are paying above 2 lakh rupees for something, is it wrong to expect our bikes to look brand new atleast for the first year or two? and this is supposed to be Suzuki's premium offering developed exclusively keeping the indian market in mind. I feel like when it comes to the Japanese big fours, the premium offerings from honda and Kawasaki are of top quality available in the indian market, but it comes at a hefty price. Even though the gixxer 250s and the fz25s maybe a few steps down in quality, they are much more reliable and better bikes than any offerings from indian bike manufacturers, period. For all my gripes, i might still go for gixxer sf 250 as its the only faired sports tourer in my budget range, that is unless cbr 250 gets released next month...Fat chance! I'll be posting a follow up review after completing 10k kms on this bike.",Gixxer_250
25,"Bought this bike in November 2021 , and ride it for 6+ months as of now with odo less than 5000km with 2 services done to date. First of all the buying experience was good, got this bike on the same day I booked it. I did not like its look before the purchase, I just wanted a full fairing bike as I have a previously owned naked fz16 (2014). There are 4 fully-faired bikes in India - r15, gixxer, ktm and apache rr310. I rejected r15 as it is under power and I already have a 150cc bike so wanted to upgrade the cc. Rr310 and ktm were a bit costly for me. So I decided to go for it. But when I saw the bike in front of me in the showroom I just fell in love with it. It looks stunning, fully rocking. Everyone knows it is the most underrated bike due to Suzuki's poor marketing strategy and I loved it because I don't see many bikes the same as mine, feel unique. Now come to the performance. Its pickup is great, very fast, always wanted to rev, smooth buttery engine sound, very refined engine, handling is superb and look wise eye-catching and stunning. Service cost is also too low. It gives me around 35-40 kmpl. The bike price is very low, it costs me 216000. Seating posture is too good, there is no way you can feel any back pain, you have to lean but not that much like r15/ktm. The back seat is very high and that is perfect for a sports bike as I think. The rear tyre is fat 150/60. Overall it is the best 250cc machine in all aspects along with its price tag. I am very much happy with it, it gives me enough pleasure when I ride it. I have not found cons except the one during heavy traffic the wrist of hand feels some pain but that is ok. I must say it is the king of the road. And I want to say to the upcoming r15 buyer, don't go for r15 when you have a 250cc beast in the same price range. Though I believe r15 looks a little better but that doesn't mean sf250 looks ugly. In the end, overall cc, as well as performance, matters the most.",Gixxer_250
26,"Paying 2 lahks above and getting a bike like Suzuki's refinement level is good but Suzuki needs to work more in terms of looks, they should give a better windshield slipper clutch n more about like facemask it can be a better deal otherwise other segment bikes can be more valuable o wish in next update Suzuki is working on it instead of launching other bikes.",Gixxer_250
27,It's a good bike for mostly daily commuting and also for touring. The oil cool engine is far better than pulsar 220. And apache 200 4v. It's mainly a sport tourer not a sporty choose as gixxer 155(new version) . But all over good and engine sound and reliability is simply awesome.Thick 150 rear tyre provides good balance. Mainly the mass balancing is so good that you would not feel a heavy weight when it's not running.,Gixxer_250
28,It is good bike.. Very very smooth.. There is not heating problem... Average current mileage 32km... Sound awesome... Its is comfortable also.... Handling is also good in city.. But on highway there is windblast after 140+..Overall a good bike with awesome build quality. The bike is powered by a brand new air- and oil-cooled 249cc single-cylinder engine that has been developed specifically for the gixxer sf 250.,Gixxer_250
29,"Riding experience is really amazing / very sporty look, easy handling, seating comfort is good..dual channel ABS works so perfect / engine response is also excellent, overall perfect bike from Suzuki / concern is on colors if Suzuki come up with some more colors it will be good. Will recommend everyone to buy it.",Gixxer_250
30,"At the time of buying the bike looked and performed fine but after a few days let's say after 400kms it started showing all kinds of problems 1. The bike has very poor throttle response , after every gear change when you try to accelerate it makes knocking sound which will make you uncomfortable and will  make you wonder if anything is wrong with the bike . Which is not present in 150 cc gixxer. 2. Its a touring bike but vibrations creep in after 4000 rpm 3. Gear change makes a lot of noise , just like bajaj bikes 4. The rear brake flutters when you hard break above 50kmph (probably fixable) Note:  will post update after first service.",Gixxer_250
31,"I purchased this bike 2018 Gixxer sf top model and I huge satisfied with this bike I love everything like look, Speed, And Average.

Bike gets heat within 10 min and heat can be feel on the leg of the rider............,Gixxer_250
33,"Straight to the experience of riding this motorcycle, Suzuki has done justice to the 250cc segment and bringing up a new competitor and machine into it. The machine is completely refined and a well built faired motorcycle. Had so many wonderful riding experiences with this machine. It's a complete package. A slipper clutch would have been nice but more or the same, the bike is an eye-catcher.",Gixxer_250
34,"I was researching and done test ride in following segment bikes ,especially in 200cc ,250 and 400 CC  . in which TVS 200 RTR ,Bajaj Ns200,Honda cbr 250 Thunderbird ,Java ,KTM ,FZ S, MT 15. finally I have filtered TVS RTR, Bajaj NS 200, dominor.TVS having a starting problem in wet condition and NS 200 is having chain sprocket problem in very short time .dominar had been updated recently but it is a star and very comfortable bike with very good road presence but the mileage of the dominar is 18  in the City 22/24 max in highway ride. since I'm in 30 s .I need to ride with kids.so I always search for street bike I never tried on R15. because of the seat height but I love that sporty type.after searching so long time finally I have seen the ad of Suzuki from the house of Hayabusa. the Hayabusa was dream for me .finally I book a test drive .I've done 150 cc and 250 CC both . oh my God when I sit in the bike and when I accelerating be the sound was like a double barrel very convincing. I prefer 250 coz dual abs and more power with the matte black.. in 150 cc you have shine black and shine silver. bad braking in 150 ccriding experiencesrefined engine the . excellent breaking ,stylish look ,beast definitely, catch stranger eyes while you drive, mileages 24 in city e 28 to 30 in highway just now for service done they charge 900 rupees 1.2 litre oil change and chain lubricant done I suggest you people to buy your motul chain lubricant for every 500 kilometre u can lube yourself for change life otherwise you need to go to service centre and they will charge hundred and fifty rupees for that with GST of  course pros1. value for the money2. best in class very stylish appealing3. refined engine headlight and tail light LED was awesome4 excellent breaking dual abs5. sure man, you are roadside stranger will definitely ask. when you stop in signal or traffic someone will definitely ask you which company bike ?is this is it imported?6. my top speed is 140 and it's very quickly to reach hundred with 6 speed gearbox . I almost drag race between all segment which I said above still I didn't do with KTM but Suzuki is the winner with above all especially with 250 cc but I know KTM is also the beast in speed.cons1. back sitting quite high but lower than R15. so that if you go with your wife or girlfriend they will be ok for 20 minutes or half an hour without any problem after that surely they will I lye over  you and it will be a extra pressure for you to seat and to handle the situation and the backseat of will be holding your shoulders or hits there is no grip to hold anywhere else.2.bad horning definitely not for this bike convincing 3. shock absorber is not that much convincing4. very important when I gone long drive is about 250 kilometres . single cylinder oil cooled unit got activated I believe but normally will activate. but in extra distance the engine was over heated and cooling system does the job.but the point is ,the heat is passing your legs ..u can actually feel it from your left knee part to calves  does from the engine .even I was wearing a jeans still I feel the heat of the engine on my left leg. I just thought if I wore a shorts or track pant..it will definitely hurts. cannot bear the heat this is the only major problem which I face...but still I love it...you cannot expect 100% ..it's omitable in long rides.guys hope I had given a honest review...but everyone have their own view and taste. I had given mine.so enjoy riding SF 250.",Gixxer_250

38,"The suzuki gixxer 250 is an ideal motorcycle for anyone who is looking for a city-friendly vehicle beyond the 100cc-150cc space. It packs a good amount of mid and top-end performance while its handling prowess further aids its case. The original gixxer was a splendid motorcycle and one that we really enjoyed. This one offers an experience along the same lines, but with the welcome addition of that extra performance, we’ve been craving for all these years.",Gixxer_250
39,"Hello i have gixxer sf250 so what overall the bike is pretty good but its has some problem, it cost me almost 2 lakh rupees on road but still its have no slipper clutch and gear shifting is hard back side is quite high and the main problem is wind shield it is totally useless some time it gets overheated in traffic but still its good for everyday uses.",Gixxer_250
40,"This is my first bike and i occasionally rode friends' gixxer and ns200. I thought of getting dominar but due to their '""amazing customer care"", i couldn't even get a test ride. But i made a good choice considering performance-mileage aspect. I am not a slow rider and not a maniac either. So, riding conditions are mixed and would love to keep my speed at 70 to 90-100. This bike excels at those speeds with great mileage and unbelievable ease.  I don't believe in people who say 90kmph is normal on naked or 150cc bikes. Those speeds are little uncomfortable for both rider and engine.  This one handles that speed pretty well with some wind protection.Best things:1. Acceleration: nice linear-pull during 3-7k rpm. You will enjoy that smoothness it gives you along.2. Oil cooling: very effective.  Not a gimmick at all.3. Stability: good stability at high speeds and nimble at low.4. Mileage: received 39kmpl for 2 tanks and average till now is 37-40.  I think it is awesome considering the performance.Neutral: vibrations post 7k. Slightly annoying but not horrible. Bad things:1. Gear shifting:  same as gixxer and not a good experience.2. Windscreen: at 100-110 bike is rock stable but you aren't because of opposing wind you get.3. Dual muffler:  better on gixxer. This rectangle-ish design just sucks. Not a deal-breaker though.",Gixxer_250
41,"Pros:This is the best city bike in the 250cc segment. Extremely fun to ride if you like speed and acceleration. Good braking, abs. Try using nitrogen in both tires, castrol/motul/ecstar engine oil (every 6 months of service), and speed 97 fuel -  it is clearly the fastest vehicle on the road! (given there are no ktms around). Can easily reach 150 kmph on highways. Long rides >300 kms are enjoyable but can give you backache if your posture is incorrect. The design is very sporty and eye-catching, other commuters will admire your bike on the road and at traffic signals and ask about the model and price.Cons: Gear shifting is slightly hard. Quickshifting can be a great addition in the future.",Gixxer_250
42,"The motorcycle was good for around 3500km,no issues faced upto this range and completed the 1st service at 800km. After 3500km near to the 2nd service time got oil leaking from the engine head and 1st gear become noisy(neutral to 1st).About this time i went to the service centre for 2nd service of this motorcycle and addressed these issues with them,they take 2 days for the servicing.Changed engine head gasket under company warranty(only ridden 3500km).After the servicing the gearing noise  became less for just 1 day and the gearing issue came back ,this time with bigger problem.The gearing 1st,2nd and 3rd gear shifting become noisy,hard and clunky ,several times I had  got false gearing.Went to service centre,but they had no idea why this noise is coming and they take some phone calls and share some of gearing noise videos to someone from the suzuki, but nothing helps to solve this issue.And they send the motorcycle without clearing the issue and told me that they send some photos and video clips to Suzuki India for this issue and they will replay once they find the solution,They are told me that this the first bike to reported with these issue.......!!!",Gixxer_250
43,"I have purchased this bike in oct 2019. My buying experience with the dealers was fine. The bike has a stunning look and i was reviewing this bike on youtube and decided to invest money on this bike. The bike was fine up until the first service and then i started facing issues with the bike when crossed 3000 kms. Oil leakage on the head gear slips between 1, 2, 3 gears, false neutral and many more.... The head gasket was changed twice and still, the oil leakage issue was not fixed. I have launched a complaint on the same with the service point and no one seems to know how to service this bike as well. I have tried multiple service stations and end up with similar responses which turn out to be negative. At this moment the bike is new and the warranty is covered. Once the warranty is complete, all of these to be serviced would incur a charge and repetitive issues would also add to dissatisfaction. Personally, the looks of the bike alone do not provide satisfaction to anyone. The performance front needs to be taken into consideration if we need to evaluate the bike as a whole. I have stopped using the bike as i have started becoming depressed day by day. There are too many thoughts flowing around and less time to write, but for good, this is a buyer's cry.I have already started wondering if i have made the right choice buying suzuki gixxer 250.

I found lot of vibrations till the first servicing .3. Looks is great though I liked the old big head light model from last Sf model . Headlight is good . Suzuki should have provided more details on the meter . Like Mileage details , speed details . 4. Servicing is ok . Not great and not bad . They charge for everything in the free service , and your amount will come around 1k, for free servicing.5. Pros - stylish , superb performance .Cons - Vibrations other than that its superb bike to enjoy .",Gixxer_250
45,First of all i loved its design and style It has a good mileage within 250cc engine. It gives a good price rate among this ranges of bikes. Only i didn't like is the normal indicators i think it should be given led But it is not a point that one should be disappointed  but over it is a cool bike to buy.,Gixxer_250
46,"One of the best among its segment. I really liked the new design of the bike it's very eye catchy. Price is worthy . Comes in 3 colours. Another great thing is the mileage, 38.5 kmpl of mileage on a 250cc engine is rare to see. The built quality is good, parts are affordable. It's a suzuki so the maintenance and service will not pressurize your pocket. Great power power and torque. The only bad thing i according to me is the windshield, it's very small and can't protect you above 110 kmph but you can have an aftermarket windshield as well. Good for touring , you can easily tour at a speed of 120-130 kmph , no vibrations at all. Comfortable for city ride as well. Gets good handling, you can even do some track rides with some modifications on.Overall great value for money bike. Recommended as an upgrade from 100 or 150 cc or can be even used as a beginning motorcycle.",Gixxer_250
47,This bike is reasonable prize others bike. It is so comfortable riding. So sporty bike and mileageble.

The Centre stand was missing I get it fixed from the authorised service centre sagar suzuki. One more suggestion to all brothers keeps extra safety lock wherever you parked your gixxer SF250 as it's an eye catchy bike which attracts everyone including thieves. So extra safety locks are a must in both discs.",Gixxer_250
52,Smart looking/comfortable seating position/super braking with abs/average mileage/powerful machine. Display/ headlight focus/ good build quality/better performance in minimum service cost/steeper suspension more durability/wide angle oil cooling system. Value for money in this budget.,Gixxer_250
53,Its a budget bike as compare to other with the legendary gsx engine it is having a softer seat and a right posture and better handling. As it is mostly covered with fiber frames so in off road the performance goes down and looks are as similar the legendary gsx 750r although it would give you a better performance without servicing of 3 months but a fairing goes on lose and make a terrible noise after a long term use.,Gixxer_250

The owner himself was very helpful and entire registration and other process took 10 daysRiding experience - I have covered 350 kms in 10 days, mostly daily commute. So far so good. Handling is excellentPerformance and looks - Performance is awesome, this quarter litre motor pulls nicely to triple digit speeds and is butter smooth at 80-90 kmph range. No lags or struggle, the engine is smooth at 30 kmph even in 5th gear. Look wise I feel front visor is smaller and makes bike look childish.Pros - 1. Powerful engine2. Decent mileage3. No back/wrist/shoulder pain for a sports bike4. Pillion seat is comfortable compared to rivals5. LED headlamps are awesome6. Bluetooth connectivity is superb7. No vibrations and super stableCons - 1. Smaller front visor2. Some sound can be heard from exhaust tip due to vibrations during hard accleration as it is not fitted perfectlyUpgraded from pulsar 220f and is worth every time I ride",Gixxer_250
56,"I don't have this bike, but i know everything about this bike,That feeling was very awesome when i first rode this bike, the sound of its pickup is very awesome, this bike run like whole butter, awesome riding experience which i will never forgetIt's look so much awesome like the beast of the road,Cleaning the bike per month, changing oil every 2000 km , and safe drive 1)riding position - the gixxer hands down has one of the best riding positions out there in the market. It does not only give a sporty feeling but also is very comfortable as well. The sorted ergonomics mean that all types of riding can be done easily on the bike. Be it just normal cruising or even some aggressive runs as well.2)although the suzuki gixxer sf 250 may look sporty, it is quite a comfortable bike to ride. The clip-on handlebars are raised, so the rider doesn’t have to crouch low while riding. Also, the foot pegs are positioned in a neutral manner, which means the riding position is slightly sporty yet comfortable, ensuring that long hours on the gixxer sf 250 isn’t as tiring as one would expect. Swing a leg over the saddle and you won’t find the 800mm seat height too tall. While it is the tallest in its segment, even 5’6’’ rider can easily flat foot the bike.",Gixxer_250
57,Best fairing bike at this price range and you can use this as your daily commuter and especially I feel good with the pillion as my mom can sit comfortably.Low maintenance and you will get better mileage on highways like long rides you will get easily 35kms  and you can rev upto 140 km/h without any vibrations.Now I feel much better by not opting RC200 over this.,Gixxer_250
58,"Buying experience were good, exchanged fz16. Riding experience is very good, I need more experience in gear shifting, good fuel efficiency around 40kmpl in usual riding 40 to 80 km/h. Very good performance, but need to clean and lube drive chain  in every 1000 km's to maintain the  smooth riding, I don't do it within 1500 km's, feel some tightness.  Careful about mirrors in traffic. Rear brake punchy, may be it is designed  as to ensure safety in slippery roads. I can overtake any vehicles in 50 -60 speed as it provides good power but only I am worried about the non availability of central stand and good saree guard. Very good head light. After sales service is good.",Gixxer_250
59,"1. 6 Month i was only watching review of bike and in this segment no any bike in comparison of gixxer 250 sf , its my favourite bike to buy..ride quality is awesome of this bike no more vibrations will disturb you when you ride, looks stunning,1st service charge only Rs.750...if you want a good sport tourer then buy it....",Gixxer_250
60,"I was thinking of buying the naked version,but i bought the sf 250. Best bike in its segment, the cooling system is perfect and there is no lose of power. The rider peg's bit low,it can touch the ground in corners. It's scream in high rpm is awesome!!!also it's handling is perfect above all else. I have been using it for two long rides and going to college.",Gixxer_250
61,"Suzuki gixxer 250 is actually one of the fully packed bike in this price range. On comparing with it's opponents cbr250 and ktm rc 200, the bike overall in between them. It is better than rc 200. Almost similar to cbr. But lacks the top performance when compared to cbr, mainly because of lack of wind protection. Feature wise, gixxer is much better than the cbr. As a city motorcycle and for daily usage, gixxer is the best in this class. It is very punchy, refined, sporty as well as comfort, and fuel efficient also.",Gixxer_250
62,More than satisfied with the gixxer sf 250 as i was the first one to get this bike in indore and the performance of the bike is to good an its pleasure to ride this beast in city as it is having a eye catchy looks and super comfortable posture. Mileage is around 35-40kmpl in city and my mom also feels comfortable as a pillion.,Gixxer_250
63,Great looking design and so comfortable to ride and good riding options and its feel like riding a super bike feel. The head light get more attraction from other bikes and the design also unique the split seat is so comfort . The bike can use for regular and sports purpose also the silver colour is gorgeous. The black colour feels amazing.,Gixxer_250
64,"I had the experience of joining my friend while he was getting his first sportsbike. He trusted me to ride it to home as he has a phobia of riding new bikes.Truly speaking, the first look didn't impress me as i am an avid re lover. But the moment, they turned the ignition on, i was flattered.The looks and styling forced me to change my mind to invest my money into this next time i go for a two wheeler.I rode it back and man, how do i explain how smooth it was. I was riding at 30kmph with the 4th gear engaged and there wasn't any hassle. It was smooth as butter. The suspension is so good and that even the roughest of the patches on our road was easy to us. Ride quality is too good if you ask this former re lover. The braking was excellent while engaging abs. We got to test it in rains.Pros:1. Styling 2. Ride quality 3. Handling 4. Suspension (even the pillion rider was comfortable)Cons: 1. The horn (it sounds like a scooty)Overall, this is a great sports bike for beginners. Don't compare it with ktm in terms of speed. Ktm is faster. But again, you don't get enough place in India to race.I am betting my money for this surely next time.",Gixxer_250
65,"I bought the bike on June and I have ridden it for 1100 kms and the beast completed its first service and overall the engine is very smooth and the riding position is very comfortable and I went for a long ride for about 200 kms and its performance is amazing and in the midrange the power delivery is awesome, we can ride in the city very comfortably because the handling is good the only con about the bike is above 140 kms the wind blast is heavy.",Gixxer_250
66,"On-road price in bengaluru is around 2.19 lakhs . Till now i’ve clocked 600kms on odo ( and will try to update the review soon after first service ) . Firstly , the thing which you notice about this bike is the looks, it looks kinda cool and has a bigger bike feel when viewed from the sides but looks smaller from front. The riding posture , if you have ridden gixxer sf 155 , you’ll feel at home on this bike too, but you need to stretch your arms a little bit to reach the clip ons. Seats are soft and broad . Pillion seat is also soft , but you may feel difficult to hop on and off the bike . The instrument cluster , though smaller in size shows all the info except for average fuel consumption. Riding experience, in city the bike feels powerful , you will notice that the torque and power starts kicking at just about 3000 rpm. As the bike is still in break in period , i’ve taken the bike till 100kmph very gradually once or twice. The power keeps building till 9000 rpm, and getting a speeds of 100-110 is very easy . Brakes , front break is quite good i can’t tell they are the best , rear brake lacks bite . Vibrations are there in the higher rpms ( i’m expecting the vibrations to go after first service is done ) . The engine feels really smooth , this is the first feature you’ll notice once you rev the bike . The headlights being an all led setup , the throw of light is very good and you can ride all night with at most confidence. The cooling system , oil cooling is doing its job , even once i didn't feel the heat near my calfs in bumper to bumper traffic in bengaluru. The only thing which disappoints me is the length of the windscreen ( suzuki wanted to carry on the katana legacy ) , i will be upgrading the windscreen asap. Build quality and paint , both are brilliant and no complaints whatsoever.",Gixxer_250
67,I really thought suzuki will bring out another gimmicky bike. The bike looks very well put together and looks right from any angle.The bike feels very light and after testing out other 250s i can safely say that this bike is super refined.The price is justified i feel. The gearshift is not the smoothest but it's just right. All in all a very good prospect.,Gixxer_250
