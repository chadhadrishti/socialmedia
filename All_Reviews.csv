Avoid rash driving and keep it in intact condition with regular service maintenance; good moped for daily commute.You will never feel tired with semi long rides. The pillion rider also feel comfortable with large enhanced seating and the mileage in this high fuel cost condition is affordable. The storage unit below seat is spacious as well.,Suzuki
"There are not many but still very important factors1. Maintenance - Never have I received a bill less than 1800. If you get a Grazia servicing it'd cost you no more than 1500 unless there is some additional repairing to be done.2. Mileage is a burn in your pocket. (I get 30 km/l.) since beginning. (bought in 2017) Never gave more than 30 km/l. Even if you raise this to Suzuki service center, they told, you will not get no more service. If you complain they'll say that's not mentioned in the free service. Pay more.",Suzuki
"1. Pricey one.2. Riding is comfortable like a car. 3. Look and performance wise good but the only draw back is heating, battery complaint, Produce over heat while running it would affect the co passenger, second battery - I bought a bike one month ago with in a month the battery goes drain, self starter is important in scooter type bikes, need improvement on this area.4. Apart from battery and heating complaint it is a nice vehicle. Pros: Comfortable for ladies, old age people.Cons: Battery complaint heating issue.",Suzuki
"Best 125 cc no nonsense scooter. It got the practicality, performance, features, reliability, fuel efficiency. Rode it around 10000 km's, usually cruising around 60-70 km/h, the engine is very refined takes only few seconds to 60 km/h, easy to maneuver in start stop traffic, got everything for a daily commuter.",Suzuki
"I spend extra money and bought special edition and what they don’t even give parking lock when I ask the service center they said you don’t get in special edition and  have to spend 800 rupees extra for it. There is no engine kill switch which is also disappointing you will get mileage of 30 to 35 km per liter, no point of external fuel filler still you have to get up from bike and use your key to open the fuel tank to fill the fuel.",Suzuki
"Owner Drum Suzuki Access 125 brake special edition, but shows access125-bs-iv in Rc as the company did not update details properly with RTO . (done 6200 plus as of now.) had a high opinion of Suzuki, before I bought this bad bike. Advertisement Is misleading. It's a drunkard, giving only 30 km/l max. Both warranty (and extended warranty) is misleading/un-claimable, since their conditions are completely deceptive, like valid only when regular servicing done every 3000 km or 3 months whichever is earlier. At 30 km/l, you would definitely not ride that much or if somebody rides they are not valuing their money. And every time, you report your dissatisfaction, the service center will convince you that everything is alright.  Of course, the courts of law will definitely rescue you, if you have the will to sue and patience to wait. Add high insurance cost for 5 years, but value becomes nil by 5 years. Good pick up, bad braking, unless you are good driver like me. Bad lighting, neither low nor high beam on correct angle, and only one beam can be adjusted properly. Good long seating. Bad shock absorbers, especially on road bumping, worst with pillion rider. Bad riding when 40 km/h crossed with pillion, good speed  riding when single on highways (but not always as shocks and brakes are not that good)The real advice is, don't buy this bike if you value your money.",Suzuki
"We bought the Bluetooth edition one on 10th Feb 2021, within two days the Bluetooth console mirror had some scratches from the corners, when we raise this concern to the dealer, they said, it may be due to external factors But the cracks are from internal and within these two-three days, we have never kept the scooter outside our home, also even in home we covered it with the bike cover, if these guys didn't provide solution, we will take this to consumer court and get a justice for this.",Suzuki
"I got on December 31 2020 but I ride in speed range of 45-55, I check mileage from full to reserve (blinking in display) first got 56, second got 60, third time got 61. Service center cut my headlight wire during first service you came to know from other showroom people they also showed me what all they did and packing they have done to fix chrome design in headlight. I never faced an handle shaking issue when heavy truck pass me in very high speed (in activa 125 I have faced this issue)",Suzuki
"After lot of research and throat cut comparison i have purchased this bike, look wise it is killer, comfort good, however the biggest or i should say the worst part is  it's mileage, it is really funny to see companies tag line 'kam pita he"" however i am not even getting 35 km per liter mileage. I have checked with my other friends too and they also have the same issue with this bike.",Suzuki
"Suzuki access is one of the most appealing moped with every things are superior than activa and jupiter . 125 cc larger boot,  mileage is 55 in city, best in class. Telescopic suspension, low back pain, low maintenance there are lots of positive point to go for access 125 .. I am love in it .. I strongly recommend to buy it.",Suzuki
Access  is my first bike I am using it since 2011 for daily for the distance of 20km(i.e. 40 km) per day. I didn't get any back pain and any health issues riding 40km per day on this bike and also didn't get any bike issues.. But after 10th year got belt problem for bike. So I am planning to replace my bike with new Suzuki access model..,Suzuki
1.Buying experience:- no resale market of this scooty 2.Riding experience:- fuel empty on mid way without fuel reservation system 3. Look :- over all good 4. Service and maintenance is costly and frequently. 5.Pros :- pick of this bike good but cons :- service and maintenance is very bad and costly. Over all i’m not happy with access 125.,Suzuki
A better-looking scooter for daily commuters than the traditionally bought activa by millions of family already. Not worth comparing 110 with 125 but with not much of a price difference one can easily go with access 125 bs6. But i was disappointed with its mileage which was not as expected or claimed by the company. But the power and torque figures in real-world play their part.,Suzuki
"I bought access in the year 2013, the initial experience was good until it starts giving engine compression problem. The vehicle used to just turn off in the middle of the road without any warning. I pretty much pushed it more than driving. Replaced the engine cylinder and piston for around 10000 rs, but even after that it still gave me problems. So if you are thinking about buying, please ask existing owners. Do not just blindly believe the dealers. Hope this helps.",Suzuki
Very bad service experience. Sudden starting problem. It is common for 125 due to its technology.Need to have compressed air and for that you have to go to mechanic.Suddenly engine stop in running condition . Serious problem when you are at fast speed.Low mileage 30km. Never go for it. Very bad service experience. Sudden starting problem. I,Suzuki
"Good in buying well priced excellent in riding like offroad,onroad, tours etc...Great performance, stylish look, attractive colours Giving best mileage, using less petrol,go more problems in my scooty Haven't got a problem till no wood engine, good design, good material,pollution-free...Good maintenance and servicing ",Suzuki
"1. I think according to price the scooty is too good.2. My riding experience is nice, I have travelled 27 km within 10 mins.3. Comfort for 3 people for long ride.4. Nice service.5. Pick is very good, only there is a issue in self start.",Suzuki
"Suzuki access is a package in itself - great machinery, great post sales service, not too much wear and tear (depends on your handling too), etc. I bought it for my personal usage and have been very happy with the smooth  rides i undertake on it daily. The efficiency is great even if its overloaded at times. This is the 2nd time i have bought suzuki access and have been very happy with the performance.",Suzuki
"I bought suzuki access after reading the expert reviews. I also test drive this scooter 2 times. But after riding 30 kms in this scooter i am not satisfied. I drove old honda activa but that feel is missing in this scooter. Access is good but not the best.Pros: 1. Seat height (uncomfortable for short people)2. Mileage 3. Smooth ride, etc.Con's: 1. Front hand bar less weight leads to waving in wind 2. Little bouncy ride/little vibrations.",Suzuki
"This vehicle has more pros than cons.  Usage period: 10 months Pros: mileage i got around 50-55km if you maintain speed at 60kmph. Storage space is awesome can hold 2 helmets . One full face and one half. Always go for disc version , excellent breaking it is best  for traffic sudden breaking and highway cornering. It almost saved my life twice. Hats off to excellent breaking. Even at 50km if you apply a sudden break (front disc break ), the vehicle will be in control , will not skid. Front telescopic suspension is great. (disc + telescopic makes the vehicle not to skid)Pickup is great. travelled 422 km in a single day, pick up, braking , engine sound all perfect no issues.After sales the service is excellent.No need to worry all spares are readily available. Price is also same as honda , tvs. Cons: Rear tyre's when ages ( 8 months) skids a bit . In rainy reason you can feel it .Also some times , when you apply sudden disc break the front mud guard touches to the front nose of the fibre  body. Which tends to crack (very rarely- depends upon person driving / way of applying break).Overall its nice 2 wheeler. Blindly go for it. This vehicle is recommended only for gentle and smooth drivers and not for sporty driving.Hope this review will be useful.",Suzuki
"Comparing with honda acitva, jupiter this one suzuki access 125 has very bad experience. 1st - seat is width wise broad which becomes very uncomfortable to seat. 2nd suspension is very hard(not for people average 60-70 kg) 100kg above can get good suspension due to its hardness. Foot-board is on bit higher level which is not comfortable even for me a tall guy. Petrol cap is inside seat.  So overall 1.Bad seat, 2. Bad foot-board height 3.Bad suspension. 4. Bad petrol filling design. Regretting much to have this scooty.",Suzuki
Vehicle compressor not working proper 12000/_ paid for maintenance at shiv suzuki Chinchwad pune after same problem suffering. My 4 friends in my society having same problem Fitter suggest me 100ml oil drop in petrol tank every month. Front mudguard crack at mounting area i think design is weak. Overall this bike failed by suzuki.,Suzuki
"Excellent mileage. Maintenance cost is very low. You will have a comfortable seating for those who sit in the back. I'm 5'11 tall for me, i think leg space is bit low. You can carry groceries items very easily. You can carry a rice bag ahead and travel happily. Pickup is also nice. Bike can go upto 90kmph easily.",Suzuki
We brought the scooter from chennai abt suzuki at nandanam. The staff were very polite and patient in explaining all the features. Scooter rides smooth in city with good pick up speed. Looks neat and premium. Mileage is 40 kmpl. For heavy people the scooter might feel out of balance when riding due to seat shape. Breaking is a bit uncomfortable at high speeds. Good for single rider use and commuting to office and shopping.,Suzuki
Around 1 year ago i have bought suzuki access 125 from my local showroom on that time it was costing me 67000 on road price. I had a very good experience while riding my access 125 because it has a awesome pickup out of every scooty and comfortable  for driver to ride and had a very good average around 50. It doesn't require any maintenance apart from engine oil. I gave this scooty 4 stars out of 5 just because of his headlight because its kind of old-fashion which is usually not liked by young generation.,Suzuki
"Long term review, purchased all new access a year back 1. Lightest 125cc scooter in the country. Its weight is 103 kgs only, that is why its mileage is high.2. Long and wide seat , very comfortable for my small family. Very huge under seat storage. My full face stud ninja fits in it without touching the seat. Also my lenovo laptop also fits in it without any hassle. 3. Front suspension is very good and real suspension is very soft and comfortable when i drive with my family.4. I was worried about the air filter issues in old access, but it was fixed in this new model. I experienced it when i drove my new access on a rainy day in delhi, with all roads full of water. It came out of deep waters without any issues. 5. Pilot lights and frond head light always remains on in this model. But they are not connected to battery, hence no issues of battery discharge. 6. Speedometer is analog, but digital display to show number of kilometers. Also has two digital trip meters which helps to know the distance between two places. 7. Handle is tall, making very upright riding position, no tiredness even after running on long journeys.8. I drove it continuously for 6 hours at the speed of 80kmph with no sign of engine effort. Top speed reached is 95kmph but since its very light weight, it is very risky. Activa and jupiter cannot go beyond 80kmph9. Mileage i am getting is 60kmpl on highways, and 50kmpl during my city travel. I travel around 40km daily on this scooter. 10. Four free service offered by company with 5 years extended warranty on engine at 700rs---Cons-1. Not fit for ladies as its taller than activa 125 and jupiter. Also the pickup is very high which ladies might not be able to handle while it starts moving from stand still. 2. After every 200 kms the accelerator setting is disturbed and had to be returned. Else it will stop when throttle is down and you may stuck in the traffic. 3. Self start is not as good as activa. 4. Sometimes it loses power while running on road. Which comes back after some time while we accelerate continuously. Reported similar issues from activa and jupiter after running 12000 kms. 5. Suzuki showrooms are limited in numbers. And they charge high for insurance. Conclusion- I use it for my long leisure journey (500kms) and daily commute to office, and also family ride to supermarkets. It has great power, comfortable sitting posture, best shock absorbers, lightest to be handled, has largest under seat storage, and giving best mileage. I'm satisfied with my purchase as it fits all my purpose which currently no other scooter can do.",Suzuki
"I bought this scooter on feb 2020, after so much of research i felt this is the best scooter and i went for suzuki access 125 bs6, actually power of the scooter and mileage is  very good, but i faced some issues, first  one day horn  was not working and next day it got ready, and after few days there was problem in battery, i had issue of self start even if i do kick start at the morning and i ride for around 15 km for my office again it wont take self start, i complained about it in show room some 2 -3 times when i went they convenience me by giving full accelerator and after that it took self start, but again in 2 days same issue, they told its because of cold climate, after my 3rd visit they gave me some old stand by battery and told we will replace the battery and it took around 20 days to receive the battery, now any ways its working properly, but now the right side bulb below the indicator is not working. I called service center they told i have to pay to  bulb , so i cant understand why this company is using such local battery and accessories.",Suzuki
"I had purchased access 125 model 2008 only 5000 kms run i purchased recently on this year . That was waste and worst vehicle i purchased from know person that fellow sell me i had run on 100 or 200 first starting problem when purchased problem is there he tell me this is not used vehicle you have luck 2 purchase i have taken 20000 Indian rupees  and send vehicle with my brother he gone to mechanic  actually he is my brother friend  .When vehicle ready bill 2500 ok and only 4 days running after same problem and i my self  gone to mechanic check engine oil   and oil not there he fill oil ok after four days same starting problem and heavy smoke from back side and i gone to mechanic he checked oil .He tell me bro oil is over in engine i ask him tell me one  thing how is vehicle no problem, he tell me good news that this vehicle is failed and this bore and piston is gone  waste vehicle your purchased please don't purchase this vehicle ok, worst and waste vehicle access 125.",Suzuki
"I bought this scooter 76,000 rupees in 2017, this is very good scooter for men and women, it gives best riding experience in city and highway, it looks good and it gives a best performance. Pros: Mileage, Performance,  Looks good, Seating, Charging port, Leg space. Cons: Need to improve lighting, Improve shock absorbers.",Suzuki
I bought suzuki access 125 special edition bs6. Mileage is low not more than 37km. Spare parts availability is rare. If you order spare parts you will get after one month. Poor vehicle service. And udan suzuki not tie-up with insurance company for cashless flow. Suzuki compare to honda. Honda is good for servicing.,Suzuki
I bought this bike june2019 and feedback oct2020.Over feeling is good but few things can be improved.1. The head light capacity has to increase. I felt with out street light driving very difficult and dangerous.2. Bike suspension to be improved. I felt even small pit make you feel like inconvenience to drive.3. Regarding mileage:  after completion of 4th servicing  giving 55 to 58 km per litter in chennai roads when you drive 40 to 55 km per hour speed limit. And service centers have to quality servicing and standards. Thank you.,Suzuki
"I bought this bike in october 2017 in festive season which was suggested by the representative when he heard about full payment option, due to him i got 4k cash back and in only 4 hours got it's delivery. Staff personnel were polite and responsive. It's tall, long and comfortable. Best part is it's tyres which was 12 inches to gives a stable and confident ride. Looks descent and appealing not for a person looking for sporty or stylish scooter, pickup and acceleration is superb considering men and women driving, mileage is key factor as it's say 'cum peeta hai' which is true. Service is good but i got battery problem in its first year don't know the reason but i think it's due to the day light running/regular option. Got replacement of battery through third party but he says no further guarantee and warranty on this, which runs till this august and i purchased a new one now. You don't have much maintenance as a city ride bike but needs regular checkup after 3k km after completing free services. No such cons if you want a descent commuter and not such extraordinary one. It is a best scooter as compare to its rivals. If you think about company, service and bike don't worry about it, product is superb.",Suzuki
"I have been using this scooter for the past 2 years. It has very good pickup and mileage among peers. It is easy to maintain and comfortable to ride as it weighs only 100kg. All is fine, except 3 major problems. First problem is that the drum brakes are bad  and need to be tightened every 100km or so.Second, the quality of steel used is bad as i see rusting already.Though the above 2 problems can be overlooked there is one more major issue with the scooter.The problem is with their service network. I have been to many authorized service centers but their mechanics did a poor job. I had problem with pick up and then mileage drop, which none of them were able to fix. Luckily I found a local mechanic who fixed it.",Suzuki
Worst experience. Just 3 months old and gives problem in riding and is very unhappy Not satisfied at all. While riding it got stopped and did not start again. So pathetic to see this kind of structure for suzuki access. ,Suzuki
The battery is the worst. Bs6 special editions bought 1 year ago. The self starter don't work the battery is always in low condition. Please fix the issue .93000 and the self start don't work for low cost of battery. You cannot start it through. When first start always I go for kick start but it did not work.,Suzuki
"1.I have concern on mileage of the scooter.2. Ride quality not that good.3.In this segment others offer so many features at low or same price. like auto stop engine, side stand sensor, distances to empty etc.4. Feel jerks when we race it  hard.5.It has a good comfortable and long seat.",Suzuki
"1) buying experience is like love at first sight because it's eye catching than other brand scooter.2) riding is very smoother as said as smooth as butter.3) in single word looks hot.4) easy maintenance and service5) pros    better look & riding experience when compared to other similar brands, lesser vibration than other scooters    cons     bit costly, lesser under seat space, throttle is tighter.",Suzuki
"Total money wasted on my bike Daily starting problem not working in any garage. High charges of maintenance, rainy season is a problem. No long rides above 50 km. I advice activa is a best Honda brand.",Suzuki
Suzuki access-125 looks very nice and that's why i like this scooter so much. This scooter comes at an affordable price and it offers very good features. This scooter is very comfortable to ride and it can perform well for the city commute. This scooter gives good mileage also. I am using this scooter and very happy with its performance.,Suzuki
"I brought access 125 in march 2015, it has a great pickup as compared to other brands. But the problem comes in mileage , if you ride it on highway it will give a good mileage of 40 to 45 but in city not more than 35. The main. Problem with access 125 is suspension, very pathetic experience. Even you can feel the back pains and lower back neck pains too much.The main cons are :-Discomfort: during long rides, it tends to become uncomfortable due to the seat being wider and considerably hard.Tyres: as mentioned in another answer, the tyres wear of pretty soon leading to slippery grip.Mechanic availability: if the bike breaks down, there is shortage in mechanics well versed with access125. Many stay away from touching your bike.Start mechanism: it does not start immediately when you try to start using the electric start after some years. Battery replacement did not help me here either.Headlight: compared to others, the headlight beam is not stronger and is focused on a smaller area.Repairs: from the past year I am experiencing starting problem and bike abruptly stops in middle of traffic. The engine gets heated and takes time to pickup.The suzuki that i own has good power and can out accelerate many scooters of that engine capacity and maybe some higher end commuter bikes.But these are designed to go for the city or at most intercity travels.The upright seating position of it makes it not very comfy to travel for more than 70 kms at a stretch.She's not designed to go fast but she's designed to be quick. She will top out at around 80 km/h and that is slow according to my highway standard.Since there is no oil cooling it will heat up faster than average sporty bikes and the tires are not designed for quick manoeuvres on the highway.Then comes the mileage of a mere 45 km/l at around 60–70 km/h(my personal observations). So the tiny 6lt petrol tank is not going to help.So look for sporty touring bikes or maybe.See every scooter has one single problem in it and that is the drive belt problem. Take jupiter, activa or any other scooter. At some point of time you will encounter this problem.Now other problem might include the spark plug problem, cooling fan problem/air intake problem as well. ( main issues in every scooters)Now talking about the access I have driven it many times. And its indeed the good scooter no doubt. It's engine is subtle, punchy at lower rpm, decent performance and the most important being an indian is mileage and it does good in that area as well.Talking about the engine problem in the access, obviously you can expect the drive belt, air intake problem. That's it. And the friend of mine who owns the access, he's not a good maintaining person of the two wheelers and he's been using the scooter for like 6 years and the scooter has the issue in the drive belt problem. That's it other than that he's having no such engine problem in it. ( bs4 version)",Suzuki
"I bought suzuki access 125 scooter 4 months ago. I have been facing many issues with the bike and need to take it to service centre every time. The scooter abruptly stops when we drive it. This issue was raised last week also and taken to service centre and they said fixed but within 3 days the same issue arised. I don't know what kind of service you provide to customers which is not satisfactory at all. I would like to get a new scooter for replacement. Please consider it and solve it asap. The list of issues we faced till now are - battery problem, abrupt scooter stops, oil pump, poor mileage etc. It seems like the service centre guys hides the original issue and does not solve it. Kindly provide good service to vehicles.",Suzuki
"Poor mileage. Service bad. I don't suggest suzuki access to anyone. I complained about notice at disc in the second service (before 6 months of purchase). Now it completed 3 free and 3 paid services but still the complaint was not rectified till now. I remind them every time but no use. Pathetic response from the service center Padmaja suzuki, Visakhapatnam.",Suzuki
"1. Buying experience was not so good like2. Riding experience is very pathetic. Very very cheap quality bike and it got many issues with engine and other moving parts.3. Looks is ok but if engine and other parts are of cheap quality and performance is very very bad than what is the use of looks. 4. Servicing and maintenance - since i bought bike, i am facing lot of issues with engine and moving parts. Now 1 year crossed and till date service people could not identify the issue and still they are struggling to repair the bike. Till date it's under maintenance. They are also not replying to mails and not responding in anyway. This is just a stupidity. Never ever buy suzuki bikes . Advice to all people not to waste time and money on such cheap quality bikes. There are much better bikes at less price compared to suzuki bikes with good quality and performance. 5. Pros - actually the fact is there are no pros for this bike. Cons - 1) major engine issue which the main thing in bike2) other moving parts are also having issues3) build quality of bike is very very pathetic4) alloy wheels are of low quality. My bikes alloy wheels got black spots all over and it's a defect of casting. How suzuki passed this casting, they themselves know. 5) heavy strokes of engine and complete bike get vibrations. 6) my bikes front wheel alignment is completely spoiled In short complete bike is just a scrap bike and it has no value .  Never buy suzuki bikes",Suzuki
Actively owing access 125 used for daily commute from last 6 month.  Service of Meghdooth suzuki of bangalore is not at all good it's average. Pros - good to handle. Ample amount of storage space. Cons - front suspension is very poor compared to tvs Ntorq. The head light is not clearly visible. Felt too much vibration. Braking is below average .Compare with Ntorq - Ntorq wins the race except mileage part.,Suzuki
"The only problem in this vehicle is the kick start, we cannot directly kick start the vehicle, making to middle stand and then kick starting is headache.Other puppet vehicles are better as we can kick start directly, no need of middle stand.Please give a solution to this. Rest all is good, giving the option of outer fuel filling made easier.",Suzuki
Very very bad service and maintenance.Low quality accessories Within 6 months of self starting troubles started.They would not clear it in service I feel its a very bad experience in access 125Battery complete They all service for adjustment only. 1 week vehicle i got good service after 1 week it started it's troubles,Suzuki
"Scooter is outstanding, Smooth riding and economic performance, What other people say this scooter poor or something else, Because of there Karma, some people always not happy in own life,",Suzuki
"I have been using suzuki access 125 since 2020.Within the first one and half year it's self starting has damaged . It's too difficult to do the cold starting, the starting motor or self starter unit is not worthy for the amount we paid for the vehicle. I'm disappointed in the poor performance of self starter unit.",Suzuki
Buy experience was not that great and I thought I would have gone with activa 125.But then due to pricing and soft corner towards mat colour ended up it. But I am happy with its riding comfort and especially luggage space you can fit a full face helmet under the seat u are even provided a power socket in the front which is better then to have it under the seat. Performance is great it's one of the best and adequate  in the segment. Looks great in mat colours and standing out with different colours seats and those rear view mirrors. Servicing experience is kind of ok. Cons:'kam to nahi peeti hai ye' Over all its a very good package.,Suzuki
"Defective vehicle delivered to me, please don't take the delivery in the evening time. It's not even run 1000km rear wheel tyre bolt came out on its own, luckily it happened on service road where vehicle traffic was very less. If the same had happened on main road I would have been crushed to death if a speeding vehicle was behind me. Today again the same thing happened to me and I was lucky again. The mechanic to whom I showed this told me that he is been seeing this problem is in all new access 125. I took it to showroom to show they told it's happened by chance and didn't take seriously they blame it on me itself telling somebody tried to steal my rear tyre. Last week I took it to service and they changed the bolt and again this same thing happens today 23/07/21. I parked my vehicle under CCTV surveillance nothing like what showroom people mentioned happened If anything happens to my life Meghdooth Ulsoor is responsible for the accident Suzuki Motors are also equally responsible. Please don't buy any vehicle from here, please don't buy Suzuki Access 125cc 2021 Model. You will end up spending your hard earned  money on a defective vehicle pain and agony will be yours afterwards. Nobody tried to steal my rear wheel it's a defective vehicle supplied to me.",Suzuki
The scooter gives good riding comfort. The engine is very smooth. I have been using it for more than 2 years now. there is  only problem is electrical issues. Have changed head light and lights near indicator twice. Battery changed one before completing first year. I live in one of the busiest city in Chennai and the mileage I get is more than 43. Mileage is around 50 in less traffic.,Suzuki
"I use this since February2020.  After 1 year it becomes very difficult.  Battery problems start. I changed new battery but no use.I bought it in Abhi Suzuki, Nellore. AP. Very bad service experience in this showroom. Technicians were not able to resolve till now. They are not identifying the problem. Bad.",Suzuki
Mileage is so poor. It gives only 35 kmpl. Just a fake advertising for the sake of selling the product. Less value for money. Only looking good doesn't matters it should also give good mileage as shown in every advertisement. Poor mileage dissatisfied more. Feels like company cheated the buyer by fake advertising.,Suzuki
Battery of this scooter is very poor. Not able to start with self or kick. Service was terrible. No dealer are providing good service. Tried to make complaint on head office no use. They will not take any complaints from customers. Very much horrible experience with scooter and the service provided by suzuki. I recommend not to buy bikes from suzuki.,Suzuki
"I bought Metallic Dark Greenish Blue colored Access, 125 from Padmaja Suzuki, Vijayawada Andhra Pradesh. Riding experience was very good. I drove 110 km/h speed on High way roots with comfort. Advanced Suspension is  need this bike. Suspension is not in satisfied mode. Looks Dashing and Dynamic. Services are  very bad at Padmaja Suzuki, Vijayawada Andhra Pradesh.",Suzuki
Its looks are different from other scooters and I like color of this scooter suzuki 125.  It's ride is very smooth and looks very neat. It is fit for all gender. I saw suzuki 125 and it's riding style then only decided to buy this scooter.,Suzuki
Worst experience I ever had. I will never recommend this vehicle to anyone ever.I just got my waste of money. This is just comfortable bike nothing else. Expenses of servicing and maintenance is unreasonably high. I bought this on my birthday and in a month. Fuel pump got down and all service centers said we don't have this part.My vehicle was at service center more than 30 days. Poor services. Don't go for suzuki.,Suzuki
"The buying experience is very good as I bought the scooter in the nighttime around 7 pm with my mother and that day i am feeling like proud that i have owned my dream scooty. As i have gone through lots of scooty showrooms and taken the test drives.Some of the scooters names will be mentioned here and what is the disadvantages of that scooty what i have seen in that:1) hero maestro fi ( basic problem is that the scooty is so much at small and while sitting in that i feel so much of uncomfortable.2) Honda activa all versions: -in this scooty what i have seen that the handle braking and handle  style are not so much different.And at last, i have gone to the Suzuki showroom which is near to my house in that i have selected two scooty that is Suzuki access 125 and Suzuki burgman, i have taken the test drive and decided what will be the price for both scooty. After deciding i have asked the price at that time the Burgman cost high so i cannot afford to buy, but the access price is near to my marking so i have booked that scooty.The riding experience with suzuki access 125 is super.About the looks of the scooty are super and the handling is awesome, the performance is also excellent.Frankly speaking, the servicing and maintenance are good from what i have seen now.Cons are: - ) in bs4 we cannot replace the headlight from halogen to led.- ) we cannot change the speedometer to get the bluetooth speedometer.",Suzuki
Worst experiences. Just 4 months complete but the scooty is not useful at all. It's not starting. Self not working kick not working. The engine is very bad. Dealer is not attending to the complaints. The company is not taking any action. But my EMI gets cut every month. Do not buy.,Suzuki
"I bought it about one month back. I am facing so much problem in its self start. 80% of the times i use kick to start it.  Even when it starts, sometimes it stops in midway. It was a mistake to buy it. I bought it for 97000 rupees and its not worthwhile. I am regretting now. Not recommendable. Go for some other scooter.",Suzuki
Total I have done 240 km in a span of 50 days. I didn't have major problems in this. I have only one problem which is while we switch on the ignition the 3 lights glow during day and night. It decreases my battery life. May be if Suzuki installs light switch which will be very useful. And they using less quality lights for indicator lights.,Suzuki
"A very bad decision buying it. 10 days after I bought, It doesn't start only. Totally depends on scooty  sometimes, I try for half and hour, it doesn't start and then I book a cab. One day I stopped in around 2 kms from my home to buy grocery, later it did not start only. After trying for 15 minutes, I dragged it 2 kms home. You cant stop it any petrol pump, it will never start again. It just a scarp now. Just a scrap. Dealer never answers call. No number plate, no servicing, no rc.Nothing. Just a scrap of 94000.",Suzuki
Self start is not working properly since one month. Don't buy Suzuki access 125. It is not worthy for its cost. I bought this scooter for 97000 and now I am unable to use this scooter because of starting trouble. Waste of money. I used this scooter for only one month. After one month I am unable to use it.,Suzuki
"Purchased the vehicle from nearby showroom there is a vibration sound comes from the machine. I have mentioned the issue to service but they couldn't solve the issue. Simply waste of money in investing Suzuki access. I would rate it as 1 star for the performance it gives. I would suggest somebody to go for other brands simply by look, it's good but performance wise it's worst. Don't waste your time and money by buying this.",Suzuki
Bike is good but not technological proof because starter and compression problem running with this new models..And i get nonsense reason from showroom that we changed oil outside the showroom because of that those problem is come...It means shell company manufacturing duplicate oil....I suggest to new bike user kindly choose another once instead of access 125.,Suzuki
"I am using this vehicle for more than 3.5 years and driven 32000 km  i have never compromised with pickup and the average. If your riding in the economy means 40 to 50 then it will give you good mileage. I am getting 52kmpl  sometime you are riding above that but it's fine i am getting the same average that i have said. Service cost is economical as per other brands. The riding posture is good and has enough leg space, 3 people can easily set on the bike comfortably. Now talking about cons i have only one issue is that if you ride more than 20 km in city you will feel in the lower back pain that i am getting it depends on the user.",Suzuki
"The price was good. I bought it for rs58000/- in the year 2014 in haldwani. Riding is good, it picks up speed very quick, the pick up of this scooter is also good. I live in nainital hill station and it easily picks 2 pillions with me, the inclination of road which i drive on is 20 degree.Look wise not good, the quality of body material is pathetic , it's all plastic in suzuki access, it's not safe regarding built quality, feels like a cycle.The servicing cost is around 2000 a year, replacements are extra.The after sales services is not good of suzuki compared to what tvs and hero offers.The pros are- pick up, mileage(50 kmpl that's too in hills), better acceleration.Cons- lightweight, poor built quality and after sales service, boot space.",Suzuki
"Buying experience was good with advaith suzuki in bangalore. The riding quality is good with sufficient power for inter city commutes.It had run about 200-300kms and once it had suddenly turned off in the middle of the road while it was running.I thought it would be some small issue.But it happened 2-3 times again in the same manner and once the accelerator stopped working while the vehicle was running.Main thing,if you are looking for this vehicle in terms for mileage please don't buy.It is giving about 31-32kms per liter, which is very less.",Suzuki
Bike is superb. Only major flaw is the electronic meter. Suzuki has left a tiny hole on top lid of the odometer box which directly communicates with the electronic meter. Accidentally water can seep through the hole into the meter & can damage it completely. You have no other option than to replace the meter; the meter assembly costs 2800 inr & plus there's no warranty on it. Suzuki service people are clueless about the issue.,Suzuki
"Terrible experience, i am using this bike for more than three years now. The braking system is horrible. I have fell down more than five times because of this horrible braking system. Even resale value is way low compared to activa. Apart from speed this scooter is of no use. I have spent more time in service center.",Suzuki
"It's a superb scooter, i had using it about 3 years, no more complaints, good performance, good service by access, smooth riding in all kinds offroad roads.It looks so beauty.I have a black coloured suzuki access 125.I feel comfortable on long rides. I am totally satisfied through this bike.Its a super experience.",Suzuki
"Bought access 125 cbs special edition (silver) in july , 2018 after much deliberation and comparing it with other scooters . This i can say definitely that it is a paisa wasool product . If you want a scooter for daily city commute few will come close to it. Pros : - 1> powerful performance and peppy acceleration - you won't realise when you reach 40 kmph.2> frugal  - when driven sensibly within the speed limits in eco mode , gives 50+ mileage after 2 servicing.3> retro look and feel -  chrome treatment on front along with silver colour and contrasting black wheels give it a classic look.4> smooth suspension and comfort - with telescopic front suspension ( missing on activa 110 ) , the bike feels as if you are riding a plush sofa on smooth tarmac.5> lots of space in the boot to keep documents , hooks to hang daily use items. Cons : - 1> lack of led lighting 2> no external fuel filling option.If you are looking for a classic scooter which is very practical and also has excellent performance , look no further . Suzuki has this remarkable product and i truly believe it should do the sales figure activa is doing right now.",Suzuki
It is a amazing vehicle for daily use and easily to manage it.Very quickly ride in traffic block and chasing very comfortable.Its seating arrangement are safe and centre of gravity. I am very successful user of this vehicle and i am recommending this to you this vehicle for your comfort ride.,Suzuki
"Looks are great but you know looks doesn’t matter. You need a beast under that pillion that is your engine. Riding experience is good but not reliable at all after your warranty finishes. The bike worked perfectly for 2 years. But the real story starts after it ; the thing about bikes is if their engines has less engine oil it starts to produce smoke from silencer. But this bike never did a thing and while riding it stopped working on its own. Its kick was jammed and nothing was working. Then a visit to service centre told us that the engine has stalled and everything inside needs to be changed like block cranks and piston ,that means new engine parts. And the cost told was 15000 for them. And the best part about it was they take 5000? as security deposit before opening the engine, i never understood this part. I serviced that bike but in 6 months again the bike started to produce unbearable amount of smoke from silencer and the pillion side becomes too hot. Then i serviced that engine outside the service centre and it costed me again 8000?. It was all perfect but in one year the same thing happened and i took to another servicing shop and he took again 8000? for parts inside. Now few days back i got to know that the timing chain of the engine has came of the disk and need to be fixed that costs me more of 1000.  That means whatever the mechanic is doing the job the bike would be good for couple of months and later all back to square one. And if you don't believe me just get outside your house and ask any mechanic if they would like to fix an access. They most of the time says no. In case he says yes then ask is there any problem with access engines he would tell you his past experience regarding the bike and you will know ultimately. There is such bad history about the bike.  You would thank me later. Also it is not covered under insurance that means your new insurance for 5000? for 5 years is all gone in water. Other companies engines are not that complicated as of access so all if others need less time and manpower and will cost you just dimes if there is problem and would be fine for life. But this bike costed me double of what i paid for in starting. Just do research on outside the service centre about this bike to your nearest mechanic ; they will say the mechanic would have not done his job properly but you know they all say same things. So save money and go for alternative options.",Suzuki
"When i bought my scooty  at first time to my house ,it si giving best performance,mileage and speed,handling all are super. In my own opinion the suzuki access 125 is the best scooty forever i ever seen before..When i bought and purchased this scooty what other are saying that it is not good scooty but in my opinion that first i will take a ride of that scooty then i will say that what  is wrong point and what is right point.",Suzuki
I have been riding access 125 since 2012 . I had good experience with it . If we compare it race with other it is better . No extra service required. Good mileage as per as my experience it is 1litre =50/70 km .Due to that i always like to drive my scooty as compared to others. Thanks to bikewale for this kind of  reviews.,Suzuki
"Very nice suzuki access 125 new model, purchased 2 month ago black metal ,riding is very nice and mileage is so good than any other scooty.  Brake,safety ,charger point,seat and digy space is very big any other scooty,mileage is so good ,thank suzuki my best vehicle ,i hope all suzuki purchaser supports access.",Suzuki
"It is quite common for a bike to have one or two problems in it's first year. But when these problems are faced by a lot even people start making videos, then there is a defect with the bike. It started with bike stopping in between rides then a fuse problem and even kick start doesn't work, the list goes on. I give credit to Suzuki for making a bike which is very smooth but there are some serious problems they need to address with the bike.",Suzuki
koi hai kyaa iss se behetar....still am riding ...my meter shows more than 30k KM...but its running as smooth like a new machine..service centers are worst expect kamarhati service centre here in kolkata....suspension is hard..torque  is like AF...enjoying till day...am doing saving because of its mileage....getting more than 52 kmpl...thanks.. recommended to all who are riding daily more than 50km per day...,Suzuki
"the scooty with handsome look and a powerful engine ,riding experience is very comfortable and smooth the scooty is for long drive,look is very attractive and having good body,value of money,need to work with mileage,over all my experience is very good and i would like tell you all if you want to buy a scooter then go for this one.",Suzuki
"I have purchased it in 2012 and used it well it was great experience for first three yrs. Later the service is not available, there is no better mechanical for suzuki access. We mostly used only for daily school drop for children. Not much used, but after 4th year it started problems with startup problem, kick starter is very bad, pickup, mileage, performance. Now all mechanics say bore problem and cannot repair, even repair cost is very high price with no guarantee, we contacted showroom (saboo motors) where we bought the vehicle, they also lifted their hands in repair. So, loss of money, vehicle looking like new condition body but engine failed. No resale value.",Suzuki
Company claimed 64kmpl mileage but it remains only upto 35-40kmpl that means company makes us fool.They tell something and give something. Acc. To mileage i will suggest not to buy the access 125. But in the power it is good decision to buy this. And also pick up of the access 125 is too good.......,Suzuki
"Riding experience is great, pick is also good in city and also highway. But maintenance is very high cost. Self start is not working properly. Average is good. Kick is almost after 15000 km is going sleepy. Seating is very comfortable. Access is no more 2 year is in working condition Also compare to other price is high.",Suzuki
"It's really too good i like this very much, i really enjoy while riding bike wherever i go i will go along with this bike, i hope it's truly made for us at the same time i will inform or suggest to my friends to buy the same bike for our generation as well as next generation at last i suggest with each and every 1 its an too good bike for good person.",Suzuki
One of the best scooty in 125 cc segment. The mileage of the vehicle is about to be 52kmpl. Riding experience is fabulous. Maintenance is very less.Change filter and spark plugs after every 7000 km. To get better mileage. And maintain tyre pressure 30 psi front and 40 psi rear. It is first scooty i purchased and satisfied with performance.,Suzuki
"I am writing review for suzuki access after using the 4 months in hyderabad.1) bought bike through bikewale 2) i used to go warangal frequently with suzuki access. Which is more comfortable. 3) look wise it is okay. Don't expect like active 5g.4) service is horrible in hyderabad(due to this i gave less rating! 1 start)5) overall quality is good until if you are not getting any issues, cons: cost of spare parts and service is too costly and pathetic work.",Suzuki
"Comparing with others brand, suzuki buying experience is good... It is one of the best scooter for city commuters... Who will be using daily.... It has classic and decent look.. But, service and maintenance cost  was less initially... After paid service, the cost was little bit high... When compared with other brands... It is best scooter only for city commuters... Who is using it daily purposes... But, for the long rides, it is not suitable one....",Suzuki
"Riding experience is ok, like any other scooter. Riding dynamics are very good. There is some vibration on heavy braking from the front, something the service center hasn't been able to figure out but that's manageable. Looks better in real world than the pics.Performance is good, adequate for city usage.Fuel efficiency is around 35-40 kmpl.Servicing and maintenance is the pinch point.Quality seems to have suffered in the new s.E.P. Engine. Mine has started burning oil with the tell-tale black suit and white smoke from the exhaust, at about 6k kms ! Makes me wonder what was done to shave off the 6kgs from the engine. Another interesting thing is that the oil filter has been removed ! feels like the pursuit of weight saving and fuel efficiency has affected the reliability.Suzuki should take note of all the issues being reported in their workshops and forums like bikewale and take corrective action. Coming from a generation which respected suzuki for their brilliant engines and gearboxes this comes as a shocker.Pros : fresh looks, comfortable ride, good storage space.Cons : engine reliability, maintenance.",Suzuki
If your looking out for mileage then this isn't a bike for you.it's been since 3 months crossed 3k kilometers before the first service my mileage was around 50-53 Km/ltr after my 1st service drastically put down to 35 km/ltr which was tested couple off times even using Shell petrol. Oops jus believed with the reviews and mileage and went on to buy this now feeling for it. Comfort 4/5. Look 4/5. maintenance 4/5 but mileage 1/5. Showroom service 0/5 if there any option of minus i would give them. Worst ever service and during my first service they have scared my bike and stated that it wasn't done by them. If u people reading my review please note I'm from Bangalore and given service at Aaryan Suzuki which is in Old airport road and people here are go neglected and done even care or follow up. Please avoid giving for service here and more over they make a Good mileage bike to Worst mileage bike with there service and with that u bike may get scratches as an complement.Over all 2/5 and Don't believe any advertisement regarding mileage. This is my honest review after couple off Months using Suzuki access with mileage being the pathetic part.,Suzuki
1. Buying experience not good. struggle a lot to get registration done. dealer submit documents only after 40 days to rto lot of following up. vehicle register on wrong name. lot of effort to get corrected. 2.performance is very good. powerful scooter. riding 30 km daily on highway. Headlight brightness is not enough to night riding. poor visibility. ,Suzuki
Worth buying this scooty . It gives you good pickup and mileage. Very smooth to drive. The special edition comes with mobile charging facility. The colours of this scooty are very pretty. It gives you the feel of smooth driving. You can suggest this bike. It comes with combi braking system. Simply it's awesome.,Suzuki
Bike performance is very good. Bike pickup is good. Bike is comfortable.Bike average is good. Bike overall performance is best. No issues with bike. And bike is value for money . You will satisfied this bike. Seating position of the bike is also good. Bike seat is very big and reliable.Bike is very smoothly drive.,Suzuki
1:Buying experience is awesome I'm from Hyderabad and the showroom guys are very helpful..2: Riding experience is awesome..3:looks are better than the any other 125 CC SEGMENT Vehicle's special'y the special edition vehicles..4:Servicing and maintenance is so good .....5: Pros: the vehicle is so light and eye catcher especially the special edition scooter's.....CONS: lack of LED light......,Suzuki
"Bought my first ever two wheeler on nov-2016 after a lot of research on which will be best. And i have no complaints with the choice i made access 125. But the services from the dealership were the worst  hence i have grown to hate the brand now. My vehicle is in a very bad state because of the services done by a bunch of immature people at the showroom.  On complaining i never got a positive comeback either from the company or the dealers. My scooter was in the showroom for a month and a half within the guarantee period for an oil burnout situation at the time they did nothing to fix it because nobody over there knew how to, now when it's too late the service staff  has a solution for me with a big budget that i can't really afford. Well this is just a post to inform the new buyers that the credibility of the vehicle alone doesn't count you need to checkout the dealers as well.  And for me rajavalasam suzuki ( charumood), kerala is a big no no. Never get fooled by these guys.",Suzuki
"I loved it . Leg space is good . Mileage is good . Its very comfortable. All features are amazing. Look Wise it's pretty awesome. I loved the design of its headlight . Its including the tubeless tire , with a disk brakes on its front wheel . It has a very good pick up . I had a very good time and a awesome rides . I Am totally satisfied.",Suzuki
"Cheap quality starter, i used this bike 1 year 7 month,Pickup and braking are awesome but i change their starter 4 times, brake shoes 5 times, clutch shoes 2 times and belt 1 time. Maintenance so high...So hard to stand this bike on middle standI can't recommend to buy this vehicle if your leg has injured.",Suzuki
Nothing problem in bike but service centre are worst. They are not servicing bike problem. Last time i have change oil in service centre after 1 week i got oil change indication on display. Then i go to local garage then i found that oil was not change at servicing time. They took oil change charger but not changed.,Suzuki
Overall performance is good but the worst thing is about battery.. It's not last long.. Many more time it is not starting in auto.. Many times  I face the problem. Ladies are having much more problems when it is not starting in auto. Kick is not that much smooth that every ladies can use to start.. Try to make batter in battery backup ladies need to start each and every time in auto start mode.,Suzuki
I am looking for a new scooty I researched all the company but I found Suzuki gives the best features in affordable price it's so good... In murshidabad there are huge traffic but i think this Suzuki access 125 cc give the best service.. And look is very good and color combination is just awesome.. And the meter color I just loved it .. And chrome finished in mirror and font is lovely.,Suzuki
"Mileage is very Good60kmpl No vibrationKam Peeta HaiService Cost is affordable.10w30 Engine oil At leastRs 240Look is very sexy Color mat red is also very sexy.....Mileage is very better than Activa And jupitar, hero pleasure and Also pickup is good 10 Nm Torque.I Am very happy To buy this product thank you Suzuki.",Suzuki
Truly said ..Old is gold !!  this retro style scooty with chrome finish with led headlamp  looks cool ....M writing this review after using 2 months ... Scooty vibration is very less which enhances riding experience and giving almost 55 kmpl mileage . Instrument console is modified with eco assist . Maintaining cost is very much less ...And not satisfied with horn and fuel inlet ...But that's ok....Best scooty in this price range.,Suzuki
"Worst scooter compared to activa , owner of access from more than 3 years , worst mileage hardly 25kmpl sometimes no proper parts available on the showroom always a problem with self start battery keeps draining in-spite of having a self start have to use the kick start very often . The only thing good about this vehicle is only the amount of space it provides . Don't fall for this stupid bike.",Suzuki
Pros is like i had use this bike for an 3 to 6 month i love to get ride with that and look vise comfort vise it is awesome and good for me is that now i am taking a new access 125 for myself now after getting the fabulous experience with that so i love that ....No words and just in case of performance of the bike is very good and excellent :),Suzuki
"Bought access 125 from rayapudi suziki showroom khammam 2 year ago February 2018, upto now for repair  i have paid up to 30 thousand rupees but still scooty is in bad condition just go for activa.. Manufacturing is problem in access 125. I have changed carburetor, self motor ,some coils, batteries plugs.. Upto now i have spent 30 thousand rupees and alot of time.. Service  is also not good.  Riding performance is good for 9 months only.  Nice pick up and  mileage but only for limited time. Scooty looks good but don't go for access . I have suffered alot.. Thank you.",Suzuki
"It creates trouble later after driving 20000 kms there is carburetor, clutch, transmission gear and belt all these vital parts requires replacement.Initial riding is good but later on maintenance cost is very high.Shock absorber is also not good enough. Comparatively other two wheeler in the class is good.",Suzuki
"Definitely a great bike for daily commute in this segment because it had a great pickup, great mileage, great reliability good control and good balance...What else i can say? great styling too.. I would recommend this to everyone especially in the cities with heavy traffic and for some great fun too.",Suzuki
"7 months ago i bought the suzuki access 125 , disc brake version with tubeless tire.I usually drive it on the hilly ways of dehradun and mussoorie. It has a balanced torque to ride on the hilly slopes too .It satisfies all the demand to ride safely in the hills.The brakes are good and the riding also gives a good experience in the sharp turnings too.",Suzuki
"Waste of money Suzuki access 125 is problematic model, Poor performance with weak battery , always facing problem while starting for just 11 month old scooty. Authorized service centers also unable to solve this problem, then i shown scooty to  private garage, he(garage mechanic)  told me that this problem occurs in 90% of suzuki access 125 scooties. Don't buy this scooty if you don't want headache.",Suzuki
"I have purchased special edition access 125 in feb 2020,april onward  getting starting problems. If we want to start with kick, we need to put middle stand, for woman middle stand is horrible thing. We have contacted saboo showroom also no one responding properly. Just completed 1st service and now it is near 2000 km only. One of the worst experience with this bike. Go for activa guys.",Suzuki
"1. I own a bs6 access 125 special edition i bought it on 15th march,2020,since then the riding experience, comfort, mileage, ride quality is exceptional even the maintenance of the scooter is also not expensive i use for daily commute as well as leisure rides its a fun riding machine no cons whatsoever for me in the scooter.",Suzuki
"The riding experience is a lot better than other scooty in the market. I have riding it since past three years and had an accident a couple of times because the tyre skidded on applying the brakes. I would say the tyre grip and the overall balancing isn't matchable to tvs ntorq scooty i have. That's quite a significant change i would like to see in future updates. Also, i must say the mileage i receive is upto 35 km/litre.",Suzuki
Very nice pickup and mileage smooth ride low cost maintenance and user friendly bike my friend advised me to take this first i ignore but when i take test drive i shocked with performance of this bike really what an amazing product which you can believe blindly i recommend this bike for every bike lovers its my first bike which satisfied me 100% earlier before this i was too much worried and confused.,Suzuki
"I have traveled every two wheeler showroom searching a right and durable scooter,finally i admired watching new suzuki access125 ,it has a very smooth and noise less ride. It looks very classic and retro style. It looks very different from other scooters that makes it real unique.Engine performance is superb, mileage is average. Suzuki gives a very good service and they also looks upon limited time...All over best buying scooter in india.",Suzuki
"I've owned the dio, the vespa and this demon from hell called the access 125. I love the vespa, like the dio and despite, loath and detest the access 125. Looks are bearable but the riding experience is the worst I've ever had. I've gone home crying the first few months because my shoulder hurt when i rode this thing. It's easier to grate a coconut with my left hand than to accelerate this vehicle. As if the riding experience wasn't bad enough, this so-called scooter stops dead when it rains. I've pushed it home at least 4-5 times in pouring rain. I've told the service guys about how tight the accelerator is and how it stops in the rain and all they say is 'what do you expect for 50000 bucks?'. I paid a little more than that for my dio and i swear to god i never had even 1/4th the trouble with that scooter. This is the worst 2 wheeler out there.. If you're trying to save money, please buy the scooty.. Or even the luna but not this thing!!! One pro that i can think of is that it moves.. Somewhat.. If you empty half your salary to fuel up.. Please do not make the mistake of buying this thing.",Suzuki
"Very satisfactory product in all angles plus suzuki trust. Initially thought of going for honda activa 125 Due to its many users on road but finally went for suzuki access 125 due to its extra engine refinement ,driving comfort as her ride won't make you tired for extra smoothness , mileage around 52 km/lt  from first day and quality product covering almost all requirements of a common users. Comparatively better product in 125 cc segment in terms of pricing ,features,mileage compared to honda activa 125 .",Suzuki
"Worst scooty in India. Very poor performance.Very problematic vehicle Engine failure.Slow off while riding.Starting problem.Engine off while riding.First 2-3 months,vehicle running smoothly.After that,slow off problem while riding.This slow off problem will be rectified by servicing operators.But this problem will be remain same after 10-15 days of servicing.This problem can never be rectified by suzuki technical teams.In future also,this slow off problem cannot be rectified by suzuki technical team, because this is manufacturer defect.Overall very very bad rating.",Suzuki
"I purchased this scooter for daily use to office which is approx 28 km one side . Pickup of the bike is not so great, acceleration is very tight. Back pain observed in long distance and traffic jams. Average is 45 to 50 kmpl. Engine makes a sound when accelerated. Brakes are good. When riding with pillion the engine performance reduces and need higher acceleration the pressure on engine can be felt.",Suzuki
"Excellent scooter to ride in highways and village roads. I am getting about 62 to 66 mileage due to fuel injection technology, the power of this bike is very good and good pick up.. They are provide usb charger & outside fuel tank.",Suzuki
"Being a owner of this scooter, i never got any issue and always comfortable with riding. Thanks suzuki access 125. It has long and wide space to seat and ride. All good in looking but the con is the headlights. It doesn't have led light. Hence lighting conditions in night ride is not comfortable if any light comes from front.",Suzuki
We can rate as 10 stars out of 5 stars.Mileage..Is 54 to 59 km/l. Awesome scooter i had never seen.Proud to being owner for suzuki access 125.Feeling great to have suzuki access 125. That's all..Thank you a lot and love you  suzuki. Final word is one of the best scooters is suzuki access 125 Thank you,Suzuki
Scooty condition is good and and model is also good...Many of the person like public and relative and friends ask me the condition and mileage and pickup ...I have given all of them good rating of the scooty...Some of the person ride my scooty also..Then they also told that it is good..And my family uncle buy the scooty of blue clr...,Suzuki
"bad mileage 45 to 50 in highway and 40 to 45 in city, engine vibration is to noisy. back light glass cover quality is very very poor. back suspension was bad,seat cushions is very bad in quality after 5 or 6 months you feel it. but overall built quality is good.i think company should work on his suspension and seat quality.",Suzuki
i have very bad experience  of service and riding the scooter  and access 125 gives 32 average in local and on road 38 to 40 maximum and scooter have lots of maintenance.,Suzuki
My dad bought her after selling his beloved bike which was my favourite too. I was so angry at first as i don't much like scooters and i look at them as an boring object but i some how fell in love with her when i took her out for a spin...Man  i liked it and i just couldn't get out...But had to....,Suzuki
1.Its a damn awesome 2.Unbelievable pick up and it can beat and the honda scooty as i tested but i have grazia also but between this two access damn awesome power!!!3.Look like the mr. Beauty with style attitude and performance is equal to duke 125 4.Super 5. Everything is that power but unbelievable power...,Suzuki
I bought suzuki access 125 new in 2017 august.  Till now it did not shown 40+ mileage.  Service centre tried 3 test drives with 100 ml and said it is giving 50.  But they are showing 100 meters = 1 km.  Service centre in kakinada is worst.  They are saying mileage promise is only for engine and not with body.,Suzuki
"Very bad experience from suzuki bikes... Access good engine and powerful engine... In tvpm kerala i bought access. Poor experience in services and maintenance... Not good mechanic... Mechanic doesn't know anything.... After first service,and after one day engine oil leaked at my home... Like many experience i have ...Now my access cylinder kit gone. If we give bike to there service center then they will repair with inexperienced mechanic... So please don't buy this suzuki bike.",Suzuki
I had purchase my access bike in December 31-2019. Bike having back wheel problem. I kept my my bike in service for 15 days even then also problem was not solved. Even i complaint to suzuki customer care their service too bad. This access bikes are having lot of problems and their service is too bad.,Suzuki
"This scooter is epic, mileage and comfort are awesome, and it's a value-for-money vehicle.And the sky blue color was very nice, I love it.Access is the best scooter in 125 segment because its a perfect mixture of power - milage - and looks,And it's perfect for girls and boys,I love the refinement of its engine.",Suzuki
"Access is a good scooty and its cheap. Riding experience with this two wheeler is great - its pick up, its speed, breaking system. It looks good and stand different from other two wheeler. But the customer service is really bad and they don't have experienced mechanics for service although its service cost is in you budget and cheap but the quality of servicing is bad. This scooty has one main cons i.E. Its low average and battery provided..... Most of the times access ignition automatically offs even while u r riding and sometimes the electric start doesn't works. At every service i told the service center guys about the problem and they didn't even bother and rectify that.So guys please think before you buy any two wheeler and i suggest you before buying any two wheeler please visit there service center for full information because owner's will tell u the truth about any vehicle what they are facing problem or happy with it.",Suzuki
"I had bought access 125 in 2018 since then never faced any problems regarding the engine even in the worst rainy season. the best part of access 125 is engine performance. The main feature is it has the longest seat in this segment of 125cc scooters. The suspension could have been better but due to smaller tyres (compared to bikes) impact of potholes or bad roads will be more compared to bikes. It is advisable that servicing should be done through Suzuki service centres only. Overall a good scooty with the scope for improvement in the area of comfort (suspension, bigger tyres).",Suzuki
While buying there was no issuesRiding with access is like a family or a friendly ride Performance is awesome as alwaysService is maintainable and cost effectiveNo issues so far only problem is mileage is 35-40 kmplAccess is a best moped bike i have always can relay on it no matter what always be ready to ride,Suzuki
"The scooter was good only at starting six months. Every time this goes automatically off in traffic when I'm with my partner. There is no solution at all. Worst service and fail scooter(access 125). In future, I won't recommend it to any one of my friends.Suzuki needs to give the solution to my problem. I suggest please don't buy this access 125 please.",Suzuki
"The vehicle's performance and engine are very good. The engine should last long for ppl who drive a lot of kms. But the biggest drawback is the mileage, I'm getting only 41 in the city. This mileage is for slow sedate driving, don't know for rash driving how low the mileage will go. I checked various times using tank to tank. Apart from mileage, the scooter is a gem. The seat length is 178mm which is lower only than the new Jupiter 125 which is 179mm.",Suzuki
Overall good experience and I am using it for more than 8 years it 2014 mode being the human edition till now I am using the same vehicle I also recommend others to buy this model which is very comfortable easy maintained It matches both genders and also elderly people can easy use mileage is minimum,Suzuki
Amazing experience to riding this scooter looks awesome.When i was buying this i am in trouble between activa and access but when i take a test drive my hole doubt are clear.It also have a comfortable leg space.And this bike have a awesome mate finishing.And its also have a big boot space under the seat.,Suzuki
"Suzuki access 125, basically the day I brought this bike the next day morning it was not getting started when I called the dealer he said the battery needs to be changed, again after ridding bike 2 months again it is not getting started when I called dealer he saying the battery needs to be changed, 1st of all I want to ask if is it a brand new bike or 2nd hand.Within 6 months so much time I am getting so much struggler what will happen after 1 year.",Suzuki
Buying experience was good.Riding experience ok. I already have an access 2010 model. Its suspension is very nice. But the new access is bad in suspension. It works only if you are riding with a person on the back sit. If you are riding single the suspension is very bad. Looks nice. Height is more hence not useful for low heighted people.,Suzuki
It amazing bike good for long drives mileage is also good upto 55 km per liter low maintenance pickup is awesome and beautiful for a peaceful journey. Superb scooter in the market it has great experience in the city and gives great mileage. No Suzuki access 125 is too good at the price of the vehicle.,Suzuki
"The ride is stiff, can't go on longer rides. For city use it's perfect, the ride position is great, hooks are provided for hanging groceries, and inner seat storage is ok for a cheap full-size helmet. So you can go more than 150km on access with a single break of 10 minutes per 70 to 80 km. Of course yes, it depends on your speed I drove my access125 2018 model nonstop for 75km with a speed between 85 to 105 on nh-8 I didn't have any problem because suzuki engines are much more capable than honda.",Suzuki

"Buying experience: brought this scooter for daily purposes. Sales-people were insisting on the drum brake version as it is best for rough muddy terrain and as we live in a rural area, some roads here are unpaved and disc brake which is not suitable for this kind of roads are more prone to getting skid while hard braking.But after riding both the disc and drum versions, we decided to buy the ride edition as it had a digital cluster and looked premium and my parents don't drive that fast either.Riding experience: very nice scooter, no issues till now, the ride is stiff, can't go on longer rides. For city use it's perfect, the ride position is great, hooks are provided for hanging groceries, and inner seat storage is ok for a cheap full-size helmet. Mirrors provided in the special edition and ride edition are chrome-plated circular mirrors, doesn't provide many views but its manageable. My parents didn't have any issues while riding.Details about looks, and performance: based on my family's opinion this scooter looks old-fashioned but still attractive. In terms of performance, the throttle response is good and very agile. Doesn't struggle on slopes even if fully occupied with co-passenger and luggage it climbs smoothly. Vibration can be felt at high rpm and the engine can be vocal after 80 kph. Digital cluster is way better than those analogues provided in lower variant. The Headlight position is good, the view is clear at night, and got no issues while riding on a low beam.Servicing and maintenance: initial service cost was 1500 which was an oil change and labor, although it is termed as free service they still charge you for the consumables and work, which is common even if you buy other brand motorcycles. I think suzuki's service costs are higher than the other competitors. Pros : 1. Great mileage in the city - 45kph tested2. Feels sturdy.3. Very practical scooter, more leg room, can carry medium-sized trolley bags/cylinders 4. Nice instrument cluster display ( for ride connect edition ) Cons.1. Mapmy India integration in Suzuki ride connect app is not very functional, should have integrated with google maps ( for the ride connect edition )  2. Stiff suspension, not comfortable for long rides3. External fuel filler cap is not accessible from the handlebar, need to get off the scooter in order to open the cap.4. Not much functionality is provided for the suzuki ride connect app, quite useless in practicalityOverall opinion: if you're on a budget and want a Suzuki access then you can go for the drum edition or special edition. I brought the ride to connect edition only because of the sleek digital display. The Bluetooth connect functionality in the display cluster is not what I use every time, so kind of useless and doesn't have much functionality apart from turn-by-turn navigation which is absurd because of the mapmy India navigation app.",Suzuki
Servicing and maintenance its need to be maintain every month and need to change it oil  the suzuki access 125 need to change it fuse when my father took this bike at once it stopped on the road and their was no garage near by and when he took the bike to the garage he came to known the fuse of the bike has stop working and he has to change the fuse,Suzuki
This bike is awesome i drive this bike from 2 months and i have good experience with ..It had more pick up an lots of power it had 65 kmpl mileage and superb performance its good bike i advice you to purchase this bike for regular city use also this bike is suitable for highway riding and long riding..,Suzuki
"Its been only 6 to 8 months since I bought it but at starting it was best but now it gets automatically off, never starting at first self vibrates all the time battery was destroyed at only 3 months brake pads destroyed worst vehicle ever never buy it in future waste of money at starting I love Suzuki but now its the most terrible and waste of money.",Suzuki
"Compared to the available scooters in market, i will rate it above them , it has great power, pickup, excellent ride quality. Looks of the old suzuki access was good enough but the new one looks more better. I have been driving it for more than 3 years now and i can say that the maintenance cost had been low which is good. Mileage too is good.Would definitely want to upgrade it with its newest model.",Suzuki
"1. Smooth & vibe-free riding. 2. Post 60 kmph it goes pull ahead. 3. Handle clearance is better and good for taller persons. 4. USB charger, boot light, led headlight, fully digital meter & Bluetooth connectivity is a love. 5. Though it has a grunty engine, it is very smooth.6. Pushesh up to 110 smoothly without compromising mileage.7. Matte finish is awesome.",Suzuki
It's absolutely a failure vehicle's major issues are mainly fuel injection 2nd issue battery month vehicle not working self-start battery discharged fuel injection problem is very normal in every vehicle in this model I strongly rejected the vehicle buying so don't buy those vehicles and don't suffer this problem.,Suzuki
While buying i was very excited has i had ridden this bike before and i wanted to own one for myself.It has amazing road grip and pickup When coming to looks it's good and stylish with amazing colours. Performance is good with oil change indicator and fuel indicator with a digital and analogue system Service is quite good,Suzuki
"I will never recommend this vehicle because fuel injection easily gets complaints and cost is more than 4000, sensors also have complaints and cost is more than 7000. Replacement cost is high customer service is bad parts also getting easily complaints no resale value to avoid money losses avoid buying this vehicle.",Suzuki
I have bought this scooter from jammu and have great experience with it. I used it to go to school. It feels very comfortable while riding. Its looks very good and its main features are disc brakes and alloy wheels. Service and maintenance costs are very low. Its price is also good. It has various showrooms across india ,Suzuki
I have started riding bikes with access only till now I have ridden an all-access model first I had access 125 basics then we took the special edition and now we are taking the bt version of it. I love this model. Access 125 bt is our new member but old too...... This model is the best than honda activa....,Suzuki
"Performance is good. Except for the battery which is very poor quality may be due to cost-cutting. Within 7 months battery failed. The service team advised us to drive 20 to 30km every day or remove the battery & recharge it once in 3 months. Even for to be replaced battery also, they are giving a warranty from the scooter purchase. Exide battery bought in retail giving 48 months warranty. Why not by Suzuki?If the battery is dead, you can not do kick-starting also in bs vi.No call from Suzuki even after online / mail complaint.",Suzuki
Must beautiful scooter on the Indian market after the other scooters service cost overall experience is good only one thing shot be noticed this was silencer chrome rubber parts must be improved otherwise look wise beautiful and like the purchase other Suzuki product like giver and other look wise performance.,Suzuki
"In 1st week of the start, the issue occurred as the vehicle continues on while switching off the key. Some engine noise continues coming. Then shown to a mechanic nearby who told them that the issue is there he opened the front part of the vehicle and vibrant and lightly tap the relay(some black part) then the engine switched off.The vehicle was used for a while again the same issue occurred then I replaced the relay (that black part)The vehicle used for 6/7 months with no issues. All routine services are done with respective km directed.After that main suffering started. Vehicle use continues to start then good but if you switch off the engine then it will not go start soon. I showed local mechanic nearby cause you can not find authorised service centre every where. He somehow checked out and start the vehicle in an hour or 2. Again vehicle runs 2/3 days casually cause I don't travel daily or long distance. But when I travel the same issue occurred likewise. In the 9th month, I finally showed to 4th service time to the service centre and explain to them everything I'm suffering with they gave me an estimate of around 16'000+ gst inr saying that the vehicle ECM is short costing 5900, total body need to change costing 4500, oil leakage from engine head, engine mountain bush need to change, front brake pad thread gone etc.Within 9 periods of time, this is my suffering.No warranty received cause shown to a local mechanic so I did not repair it in the service centre. But still, they charge me for servicing 1095 inr.Choose wisely.",Suzuki

Nice pickup and good performance  nice mileage comfortable handling & design is look like a queen  i suggest mate black color & disc brake special addition once again to tell pickup is very much good and height speed is 100 to 95 full speed so this bike is very good and pocked friendly money saving,Suzuki
"1.  Buying experience :-The buying experience was not as much as i expected , the showroom was late to order the disc versions of the scooty ,as the scooty was new in the showroom they gave me the foot guard of access 125(old) which don't have a good fitting and that was very annoying .2. Riding experience :-This scooty is not for people having short heighted people, this is pretty large and light weight only 102kgs (about 8 kgs less than activa and 1 kg less than activa i(lol)) , have metal  in its front mud guard , its seats are quite comfortable , headlamps are not so bright , suspensions are pretty good , got a nice ground clearance, awesome pickup speed(0-60kmph in 7 secs) and great mileage 50-60 kmpl (on average speeds like 40-70kmph) and have good top speed.3. Details :- displacement- 124cc cylinders-1 max power-8.40 bhp @ 7,000 rpm maximum torque-10.20 nm @ 5,000 rpm fuel delivery system-carburetor mileage- 50-60 kmpl on average use.** facts based upon experience -   ->top speed 102 kmph in about 20 seconds. ->can carry 3 people of weights 112kg(me)+102kgs+70kgs with no discomfort with  top speed about 80-85 kmph.->on rough acceleration or harsh use(no stunts, only riding it in its top speed) it decreases its mileage to 35-45 kmpl (what i do). looks- its have a nice retro muscular light weighted body( with disc) with square chrome headlights, analogue white speedometer, glossy royal blue colour(which i have) and matte black also looks awesome(new in market), which make it out of the crowd of scooties in Indian market in its price range.Price- i brought in 70k (bhubaneswar)4. Servicing : in total 5 free services and 3 more paid ,if all 8 services are done on time he/she will get 9th free service. **maintenance : not much of maintenance is needed other than engine oil change5. Conclusion+++pros++++ + valued of money 65-70k(depending upon regions)+ good top speed 102 kmph+ great mileage about 50-55 kmpl+ can carry 3 person of weights 102+112+70 kgs + long seat+ good brakes (disc)+ great looks + good retro looks + light weight 102kgs+ nice handling+ sep (suzuki eco performance)+large under seat storage+ mobile charger (in front)+ design is out of the Indian crowd of scooties-----cons------ low power headlight - sometimes problems in sel fstart- not led light in under seat storage- problems for short people (under 160 cms)- silencer's sound is not so good (if you want superb inbuilt sound go for hero maestro edge)This is the full review of my scooty about 10 months old I hope you like it.",Suzuki
"I was in market for an automatic scooter, with stop and go city traffic, a scooter was more suited for me for the daily office commutes. I wanted a scooter with better front suspension, and after couple of test drives, decided on all new suzuki access 125. The whole test drive and buying experience was great, the people at midas suzuki, malakpet, hyderabad treated me well, they were informative and helpful. On 28th august, 2016 took the delivery and have been using suzuki access for my daily commutes ever since. From day one, i was impressed with the ride quality of the scooter, coming from a 150cc bike, i thought there would be lots of adjustments to be made to ride it comfortably, but to my surprise, a little change in seating position and posture was all it took. I never felt need for power on the scooter, as it zipped through traffic with ease. It is quite manoeuvrable, and tractable on the city roads as well. The most impressive thing of all about the scooter for me is it's balance, i have ridden few other scooters in the past, but access 125 is the most balanced scooter that i, personally have ever rode. Initially, looks were the first thing that attracted me towards the access 125, for me suzuki have taken few cues from vespa in design aspects, in a good way that is, the modern retro looks were quite attractive for me, the scooter is neutral in design, suiting both the genders. As far as performance is concerned, like i said, i never felt need for more power, it's really zippy and the rubber band effect which is evident in any cvt scooter, is minimal in this one, so i am happy with it. As far as fuel economy is concerned, with my aggressive riding and in city start stop traffic i am getting around 40 kmpl, which i must say isn't satisfactory, particularly keeping in mind the 64 kmpl claim that suzuki made. With light hand on accelerator you may fetch around 45-50.I have had mixed bag of experiences when it comes to servicing of the vehicle, as we all know, expecting a lot from any authorised service centre will leave you disappointed. But there are occasions where the works in job card were not taken care of, and i had to remind them about it when i go to get the vehicle. The speedometer on the scooter wasn't working properly, as it will not show the actual speed in the console, when raised a complaint, i was told the speedometer sensor was at fault and the whole console has to be changed. But the standard procedure required a company technician to come and check it to give it a green signal for replacement, which took quite some time, and required few calls from my side to the service centre and few mails and tweets to suzuki customer care which went to deaf ears. Barring these, the experiences with service were quite like other service companies' service centre. Pros:Very comfortable to ride, zippy; in fact in the official bikewale head to head comparisons this scoot gave aprilia sr150 run for its money, balance, looks, long seat and lots of storage space. Almost forgot to mention it's brakes, mine is a disc brake variant, and it stops like a dream for a scooter!Cons:Mileage not up to company claims, paint quality is not up to suzuki's standards. Overall i am very satisfied with the scooter, it's a wholesome package for city commuting from suzuki. ",Suzuki
Having a great experience driving access 125 on a daily basis .Super pick-upGreat mileageFamily drivingGood lookingGreat performanceOver all its great bike ...Thanks suzuki for launching a such a good bike .... Appreciate your efforts towards making a great vehicle at present situation of traffic.,Suzuki
"After lots of comparisons and research, I have finalized Suzuki access125. Handing is very good, and easy to maneuver in traffic good. But on Highway or in open roads it wobbles at low speed too.The suspension is very stiffer. Around 4 km I have daily travel on broken rodes. It needs to be a little soft or just above mid settings Talking about seating position and seat, the seat is spacious but not comfortable and needs more cushion The position is okay some people like it, but someone don't like cause of the high handlebar.Looks very nice and classic, plastic panels could be better, near the rear foot pegs,  without any crash they broke. The paint quality on my scooter is not good which is matt silver. The area beside the seat is fainted, and washed.And the best part is the engine. The initial is superb in the middle is also good. But in the top end, it's lacking. It gets quickly to 50 to 60 mph, Some times till 70 km and then it takes lots of time To go on 90 and above. Looks classic but also has some hooligan in itself. Servicing and maintenance It's slightly costly considering other brands. Except for Yamaha.In rural areas or in small towns it's not easy availability of parts And service stations.Considering Suzuki instrument consoles I have got 45 to 55 kmpl mileage but I have doubts. There is almost a 20 percent of error in the trip meter. 8 km running shows 10 kmProns1. Good engine 2. Looks 3. handling 4. Overall performance Cons1. Suspension 2. seat cushioning 3. Faulty instrument console 4. Highway stability",Suzuki
"I buy this scooter in September 2020. I was very smooth for 1 year, but then it starts getting problematic. Breaking should have been better, I have to change the rare break shoe 2 times in just 20000km of riding. It's almost 3 years now and it sounds noisy, engine gets rough, mileage drops drastically.",Suzuki
The main factor is average is very less and what do u expect from a scooter while driving in the city where due to on road traffic the fuel usage is more and it is very less compared to the old access though the looks are very dope but for a average city rider what matters is average so i think it does have a problem only with the average,Suzuki
"It's been 4 months of owning Access 125 se and I am already started seeing problems.1) after the first free service when I notices my scooter after a week I saw scratches on the scooter, now the service center denying them to fix them as I didn't notice them while taking delivery after the service.2) self and kick start suddenly stops working sometimes when I turn the engine off at the petrol pump or signals. I found that the battery is faulty. The service center just recharged the battery.3) uncomfortable ride: the rear suspension of the scooter is so stiff that it gives back pain even in short rides. Once I went on a 90km trip on this scooter and had back pain which took 2 days to go.Even though my friends suggested going with honda, I choose this scooter considering it is Suzuki and the quality and product would be better. Made a mistake.",Suzuki
It's been a week now. Powerful engine in the segment. But the parts are of low quality compared to it's previous versions. I own drum version.Break system is not that great over all it's good vehicle because of engine and not that great with respect to other accessories. Can expect mileage more than 35 to 40 kms with usual riding style ,Suzuki
"Servicing and maintenance are too bad, I recently visited your showroom for my scooty back tyre checked due bulging due to air pressure they said that milage should be below 10000 km. I went three times for this problem to your showroom,but your showroom persons tell me to keep low air in my back tyre and use single member ride.",Suzuki
"2. We can't go long rides ( more than 100kms) it will immediate repair, servicing charges are more, i had a worst experiences with this bike and i am riding this bike since 2 and half years, in 2.5 years i spent around 25 thousands for repairs only, all the items are more expenses compare to other bikes, please guys don't buy this bike and don't face problems, if the bike is broken down in front of service centre, i ll not go that service centre and i ll give in mechanic shop only that much worst service centres we have",Suzuki
"Access 125 is a good economic two wheeler it's provide good mileage around 40km and above Only problem is services as to done regularly which is a little costly but overall it's a good vehicle to buy and ride, initial pickup is more compared to other two wheeler at this range.. So no waiting just book suzuki access 125",Suzuki
I purchased this scooty... And the engine was good and even you can use as a commercial purpose for your shops the pickup was good but the only fault its average was poor....Overall it is a good as per seen as the quality of engine... And at last it contain more feature as compare to older version their seat space is more...Thank you....,Suzuki
"Buying experience: simple and hassle-free (aryan suzuki, old airport road bangalore). Riding experience: pure joy, I've ridden most scooters being sold in india, none of them match the comfort, stability and performance of the access. The suspension set-up is so perfect that the jolts of bangalore traffic are evened out, yet, if you want to corner like a lunatic (on a scooter), this thing gives the perfect balance such that lean angles are quite acute for a scooter. It is so much better than the honda activa and the only scooter that matches its suspension set-up is the aprilia which way more expensive. Even for the pillion rider this thing is very comfortable. My mom enjoys sitting on the access more than any other vehicle that my brother or me have owned.Brakes are drum in my version. They have good bite and feedback, and give enough lock that if you want to slide a bit the vehicle allows you to. The chassis provides so much control that it quite easy to manoeuvre no matter what the speed. Coming from riding bigger motorcycles, i never felt lacking with the access. It truly is a do it all machine. Other than the power department, i never felt like wanting a bigger motorcycle, even in terms of power, if you understand how to work the throttle, you can give many guys on motorcycles jitters with how fast this thing takes off. The throttle response is instant but it takes understanding the gearbox to work the throttle to get the best performance out of this vehicle.Details about looks, performance etc: I've highlighted performance in the previous section and don't wish to do so again. Regarding looks, well, it's good looking but i found the vintage version (which i don't have) to be beautiful, other than that the bike stands out from other vehicles in a parking lot and also in traffic, although the latter is due to this being the fastest scooter you see (insert smiley). Practicality is one place where i find the access a little lacking, the boot is not big enough to hold any helmet of more reputed and affluent brands. Does pack a lot of stuff though.Servicing and maintenance: servicing has been hassle free with my dealer, although their constant calls when service is due is a bit nagging. Maintenance costs have been minimal as of now. With only one part not functioning properly which was the accessory charger, which was an easy, cost-free fix.  In a nutshell, a wonderful ownership experience. And now I've got to go and answer the service call....Pros : Big and fitting scooter for a bigger rider like me Great performance for its classGood balance of performance and fuel efficiencyGreat chassisGreat bikeIt's a suzuki, maintenance is japan-class, never broken till date, likely to never breakGround clearance is enough to ride the vehicle in india, without scrapping, unlike some scooters and motorcycles..Cons :Too big for smaller riders like my sister-in-lawPower can be overwhelming initially for those not used to it (my father)Horrible stock tyres (mrf)Headlamp, might as well be blind in the night..They are bad..Drum brakes do tend to lock, especially the rear, if controlled is fun, otherwise leads to a horrid accident.",Suzuki
"Suzuki Access 125 is no doubt a good scooter. Great power, good mileage and low maintenance. Everything feels great but talking about comfort then I will say the suspension is a bit stiffer, and you can feel the road most of the time. And good build quality at an affordable price. The best seat cushion, makes you tired free on your long ride too.",Suzuki
"I had an amazing experience with access 125. Really want to buy this once again as I already sold my older one. Performance is really good. Pickup is at next level. Mileage could be better, somehow 40 was brilliant. Visual appearance at its best. Seating space is good. Comfortable for long rides too.",Suzuki
I am very huge fan of this scooter. Because it's pick up is like 150cc bikesAnd it is very comfortable  to ride.I have old model scooter suzuki access125 can overtakes any scooter which have 125cc engine 1. Amazing  pickup2. Very comfortable 3. Good looks4. Large place in boot5. Stylish lamps6. Comfort for all generations ,Suzuki
The mileage told by the company is 65 but i am getting less than 40...But except this other things are okay and the riding experience is so good and is easy to use in traffic......And less maintenance is required......and different stunning colors are available.....Good performance except this mileage issue......,Suzuki
"I bought my bike around mid-2019 and at first, I used it very carefully I like the color and design of my bike as was a blue color.Firstly I used my bike occasionally only on weekends after a few weeks I used it on my daily up and down traveling from home to the office around 20 to 25 kilometers daily it gives me more comfort to come home safely.Look wise it is very decent and sober, it gives you the best performances for eg mileage I get on my bike was around 55kmpl which is quite good for me and the seat is also quite good and the space in front for luggage is much better than activa and other scootersPros: good mileage,nice luggage space Cons: sometimes couldn't start if you ride non-stop for more than 80km.",Suzuki
"The buying experience was good. Pros - looks stylish and the white colour of the special edition is unique and stands different out of all the colours. Storage space is good. Usb point is very slow for phone charging but it's good for emergencies. The seat is huge too and a good fit for healthy people 2 healthy people can still sit comfortably.Cons: riding experience was ok at the beginning, the bike is lightweight and is not stable while riding at a speed especially when a huge vehicle is passing from the opposite direction in speed(narrow roads of the village), the scooty literally shakes which is very risky. Mileage issue. Was told it will give more than 50 but not even getting 40 after riding it for 500+kmThe space for petrol is very confusing. U have to still get down and open the petrol lock and while putting it back it's difficult and confusing too and not sure why they gave so much useless space in the tank.Overall it's an ok thing. My suggestion is to check more reviews and compare this one with Jupiter before buying it.",Suzuki
"Pros:1. Good Front space for carrying things. You can fit maximum 1 domestic lpg cylinder side ways.2. Comfortable Seating3. Good mileage. I travel avg 120 kms per week. So I always keep rs 300 or sometimes rs 200 for fuel per week.Cons:1. Braking takes too long. You can't ride very fast2. I don't know why but the tyres always slips especially on water. You can't just bend around, you have to ride like a grandpa.3. Fuel injection problem after 6000 kms. My local mechanic helped solve this by taking out the FI choke light connected to the start spring. I don't know how to explain this better but you will get my point if you own one.4. For the average Indian, the parts are expensive plus the original parts don't last long. So I just buy the duplicate versions which are cheap but very good for me. For example, price of Disc pads is approx. Rs. 1200 inclusive GST while in local shop it is Rs. 220 (with bargaining) but very good quality. If you know where to get your parts, it is well and good.5. Service centres will try to milk you for every little bit of money they can get while doing free servicing. They will try to change air filters, disc pads, start plug etc., when not needed. Be vigilant and don't allow such things.",Suzuki
"The staring problem is gone when the battery was replaced, but it's reoccurring now and then. Servicing is a nightmare. There is vibration while moving the scooter from idle, but the issue is never attended to by the service. If the scooter is driven at a higher speed continuously, the piston gets jammed. We can't use self/kick to fix this. Once the engine cools down in 30mins to 1 hour, the issue is resolved automatically.",Suzuki
"I bought access 125 Bluetooth alloy disc variant in white color and I fell in love with the color, performance and mileage but I’m not satisfied with the service men’s at the service store at nellore abhi suzuki showroom. And the main con and some hesitation are when we are starting the bike the spark starting system makes the keeech keeech keeech sound expect this the bike was good at all things and I’m using my access 125 for two years.",Suzuki
"Brilliant scooter and very peppy scooter, strake difference from competition in terms of performance and comfort , a no-brainer in the segment. Well laid out economy if ridden well, good quirky engine, very nice feedback.Con: the Suzuki service network and service experience, Bluetooth not really useful.",Suzuki
Buying this scooter had a good experience very comfortable to ride and has many features it looks very awesome and has different color styles and awesome brakes and led lights. very nice and has good maintenance on a budget very smart bike and very comfortable very good experience riding this scooter and sounds like a sports bike when we speed it has more power and more speed to ride and good mileage very wonderful scooter.,Suzuki
I bought a Suzuki access 125 on march 10th 2023. I bought it through full cash payment and the staff in the showroom were friendly. The whole process was very smooth. I got the delivery in a few days. The riding experience is very smooth. Like riding on top of the butter. I was eager to buy this vehicle because of its killer looks. Very good pickup and good control. It's giving around 45kmpl. When it comes to pros and cons I want to appreciate its design.,Suzuki
"Do not but 2 wheeler of this company the engine is terrible and will engine will require piston cylinder replacement in 2 years, the company and its dealers are fraud and will loot you like anything. Saving your money and buy scooter or bike of any other company. Never but bikes or scooters of suzuki company.",Suzuki
"Excellent vehicle, amazing pulling power, i have been driving with 4 family member for years excellent performance without any issues. Minimal maintainable cost. Perfect for family, student or any gender.True value for money and very safe vehicle. Wonderful colour and sound. Uphill pulling capacity with 4 members is ideal. Even great commuter in both city and highway.",Suzuki
"Suzuki access 125 body is very strong, since I have buy before a year ago, no noise after sales service is very good performance very good, look I like very much, I like and proud to ride and owner of the scooter like this Suzuki access 125. Advice to all my friends, Want to tell about pros and cons of the same, as per my opinion 83% pros and 17% cons.",Suzuki
"Servicing cost is very high.Every time 3000+ it's a better option to use cars.Bike start issues occur every 30 to 45 days.Initially, the bike was good for one year. Later starting trouble comes both in button and kick start, the scooter will stop itself.Ever recommend this vehicle to anybody not for daily use anyway.Suzuki needs to improve on that.",Suzuki
"Its amazing ride experience with suzuki access 125. Really i have satisfied with mileage 51+, smooth riding . I had already experience with activa. But i am feeling suzuki so much comfortable for family and single.  Its so smooth on riding even tough crossing 60kmph without noisy. I feeling comfortable and happy.",Suzuki
"1.The stores are clean, bright, and organized,2.Super power in hand3.Dashing awesome 4.Average cost5.Value for money / colour options not goodI fell head over heels in love because it was the most wonderful experience in the world. It transformed me from a mere human into a two wheeled god. 50 years later, i’m still in passionately in love  scooter suzuki access 125",Suzuki
"1. Buying experience is great, suzuki salesman treat their costumers nicely.2. Access 125 is just amazing. The headline ""kam peeta hai"" is just true. I love access 125, it is so smooth.3. It has enough space for passengers, enough leg space, a large boot space, a full size helmet can easily be stored and a litre of bottle too.Loved the design, the look4. It has less maintenance cost even. Its been 1 year since i have given it to service and still its driving experience is great5. I like each and every thing about it.From my side there are no cons.",Suzuki
"So rough bike with so many issues.The issue is of battery problemSecond service and in service centreI gave you my example when first time on bike it got a fuel pump issue that time i gave my bike to service. At service, the worker checked the problem of my bike and they went on the road and had an accident. The worker didn't get injured but my bike is fully damaged.",Suzuki
"The marketing to buying experience was all good but soon after my scooter hit 50 KMs I got a break failure while I was driving, thanks to slow speed I didn't get into any accident. Upon completing to the service center, they didn't even have a proper party to change the broken wire, had to wait for 6 days to get it placed.The next accident I got saved because of slow speed was when 3 fuses out of 5 got short-circuited because of normal cold weather in Rajasthan (clearly a joke). Scooter had to be dragged back home, and had to wait for about 10 days for parts.Even had to get the battery replaced before I could even drive 2500 KMs, it got big(overcharged), had to pay for the battery as it doesn't fall under the warranty of parts.The fuel indicator shows the tank even if there is nothing in it, an oil change is always on, the headlight is always on full beam regardless of the toggle button, randomly starts beeping, and all metal side rims are always making rattling noise even on plain roads.",Suzuki
Latest suzuki is really good but earlier version was very poor in quality But latest model superb with good quality of suspension and mileage of the vehicle is good Servicing or maintains cost also compare to other brands low maintains cost.But colours are limited only that's a drawback engine power is nice for 125 cc never expected this power in 125 cc bikes.,Suzuki
Since 2006 my family is using this bike. It has run more than 42000 km . In the last 16 years have twice got crashed in a road accident. Only had to change damaged body parts. All parts were available. The service center repaired it nicely. Still working well. Seems like even 5 more years won't be trouble.,Suzuki
"Best scooter in its class, with not a single problem, and maintenance this is a very true review. Best pickup ride quality and all is very good...... For the last 2 years, there is not a single problem and not a single part has gone so take this scooter. honda scooter has starting problems I also have activa i and activa 125 but they have little problems.",Suzuki
Very bad experience. Had to visit the service center every 500 km. So many defects. Every time had to change spare parts and servicing cost is also very high. Service center people are looting the people in the name of service. There is a  technological defect in fi system. The engine gets off so frequently. Need to relook into the engine.,Suzuki
This is very good for my grandfather and I owned this bike from last 3 years and its ridding experience is very good and it's look is also fabulous its servicing cost is not much and its maintenance cost is very low it's fuel efficiency is also low I like this bike because its look better than my old activa so this is fantastic.,Suzuki
"Riding experience is quite average, Performance and self-start have a very bad issue, it’s not worth when you will spend around 1 lakh rs for bike and against you are getting service and performance of the bike, we could expect better performance. The battery has many issues even with 15 days self-start has not started and by a kick, also current has not reached upto engine. Many times I have to leave my bike on road and find a mechanic to charge the battery. When I complained to the showroom they did not respond. After selling bikes their r roles ended. This is up to you .. My suggestion goes for Jupiter instead of purchase access .. I am not satisfied with this bike ..",Suzuki
"I've driven pulsar 150,tvs jupiter, splendor but suzuki access is the best vehicle. Very smooth, elegant and stylish. Comfortable seat, 4 persons can ride comfortably. Colours of the vehicle is so impressive. Low maintenance, engine sound is not too noisy. Easy to park, over all wonderful bike I've ever used...",Suzuki
Please don't buy suzuki access 125 I have a last 9-month red colour top model .. Last month's engine valve plate and other assembly parts were damaged. And then trouble and big trouble continued till present time. Please don't buy suzuki access..And very bad quality better than other two-wheelers.,Suzuki
"This scooty is no1 and heavy pickup scooter but sound is very high and comfortable to drive and seats are very long, 3 people can sit.",Suzuki
"I had worst experience b6 Suzuki access, model. Every month I am getting sensor problems. And different problems. I never advise everyone. I have lost so much money due to bike repair. Sensor vehicles are the worst vehicles. The cost is over. Worst product.",Suzuki
I have purchased this model nov 2021 bs6 last  10 days we have facing problem with petrol motor not recommended every time service centre employees said you are not facing this problem in future so many times i pull this vehicle 3 to 4 kms company will not help me very had don't purchase access bs6 model,Suzuki
"Before buying access many told don't buy this vehicle but I have more faith in this and buy but now I feel much more about why I bought this bike. Really very worst parts.. Initially, I got a battery problem then they old this slot all vehicle this problem arises so we change it and give. Now once the vehicle is off then won't start again km speedometer rise to the top and again it won't come back. The engine got off.. Really the worst vehicle.",Suzuki
"1. So simple and clear,2. Truly enjoyed,3. Looks retro n classic, Really amazed me while riding like it's flying without any vibration engine refinement is damn butter smooth with good mileage such a beauty in this segment. Suzuki rocks4. Really good,5. Fabulous 125cc,   cons: there is no switch to open the petrol lid.",Suzuki
"The buying experience was good, with same-day delivery. Superb stability on bad roads as well as on highways. Generally, I maintain 40 to 50 kmph getting 55+in city riding and 60+ kmph on high ways, occasionally 70kmph getting 60+ kmpl. Many times revv at 70kmph on long rides still get 58+ kmpl. I changed the company fitted rear, seat extra grip. Maintain tyre pressure 28 front /38 rear. Mileage dropped by almost 4 to 5 kmpl. The previous tyre gave 64 kmpl. Its a bs3 model 2017 march.Recently i had a trip from my home town to digha 270 kms approx, single side with my friend, total weight total about 150kgs gave break of 20mins after every 50+kms. The bike was running butter smooth with super stability in spite of 37k kms and 5yrs old. I use to change the engine oil regularly after approx 3.5 k kms.It's the best scooter in its segment. The long seat, boot storage, and space in the front are the other pros of the scooter. The only con I found is the light, not good for night riding.",Suzuki
"Good family scooter.. Gives better mileage.. Best suspension.. Very good for long rides.. Lacks bit braking.. Otherwise best scooter in India in terms of reliability and build quality.. Feature-wise top notch.. The navigation feature is very useful for long rides and USB port is also very useful. Overall, the all-rounder scooter for the family is suzuki access 125..",Suzuki
"Ok so this scooter was delivered to us during christmas and has never caused any problems whatsoever. The best things about this scooter are the power and efficiency. Granted, this doesn't have the most power(on paper) and neither in actual real-world use cases but it's more than adequate for daily use. Another thing is the efficiency which is just absolutely bonkers! it provides efficiency of 50+ most of the time and when we had initially bought it, it was even upwards of 70! the ride is comfortable and you can easily seat two adults on it with no problems. The ride is pliant and smooth throughout with no jitters and absolutely no engine vibrations and you won't even feel the engine running unless you rev it hard in which case you will feel the surge of power this scooter provides! all in all 10/10. Well done suzuki, a well-made product for all ages.",Suzuki
I’m not satisfied with suzuki access 125 this bike is having a fuel-air lock problem so I will not suggest you buy suzuki access worst bike has ever seen manufacturer defaults don’t buy it.Some people suggest this bike but I’m not going to suggest anyone so please not buy I hope you understand.,Suzuki
"Access 125 bs6 good. But service centers worst... My bike before  servicing well ofter 1st  servicing bike facing problem Now 5th serving is completed not solving my problem.Riding experience goodBefore servicing.Ofter 1st  servicing too bad.Servicing and maintenance worstDetails about looks, performance etc.  Good.",Suzuki
"Buying experience -  staff is good and specification  and on-road price brochure Riding experience -  pickup and mileage goodDetails - long seat, USB charger, water bottle holder, cluster changes good, oil indicator shown in the cluster Servicing and maintenance experience bad service centerLooks very good.",Suzuki
"This is my second time using access 125.. But this time it really disappointed me.After buying I found the 1)steering is not in the alignment. Which cannot be repaired but must replace it seems. Now I have used it like this.Since I have paid what the company demanded they should also provide a genuine product to their customer.I feel like I am using a second-hand scooty although I paid the full amount.2)the servicing center took 100 rs as working charge for putting number plate, which I think is their job to freely serve.Because of the earlier access, I used at a different shop they put it for free.Truly disappointed with Suzuki.",Suzuki
One of the best scooty in 125 cc segment. The mileage of the vehicle is about to be 52kmpl. Riding experience is fabulous. Maintenance is very less.Change filter and spark plugs after every 7000 km. To get better mileage. And maintain tyre pressure 30 psi front and 40 psi rear. It is first scooty i purchased and satisfied with performance,Suzuki
"I preferred buying honda dio but my brother made me to take suzuki access.Within 5 months of buying i faced starting problem.Main problem i face is starting the engine after i have left it untouched for 2-3 days and some times engine stops automatically when slowed down.I have pushed my bike so many times for avg 3km to fix this.Also this problem emerges after giving to service.The  suzuki service people couldn't fix it.I changed to another suzuki service centre , the problem was solved temporarily , then oil started  to leak into front tyre at 20000km i had to change spring of front then the starting problem re-merged they told me to replace some parts  to fix it and would cost around 10000.I have replaced quite no of parts earlier also.Its been only 3 years ,20000km of ride they are asking 10000 i am not confident this will solve after paying the money.Riding is good in average speed , above 60 and sudden brake then their is jerk on back tyre.It skids on riding in wet mud road and once i fell riding in it.Mileage 30-35km.ProsNice to ride in tar roads, good to handle, easy manoeuvre.ConsEngine starting problem, skids on wet mud roads, rear tyre jerks on sudden braking, tyre pressure to be always maintained as per manual for smooth riding.Certain parts to be replaced within 1.5- 2 years.I don't recommend this bike look for others.",Suzuki
I have taken a ride of Uttar Pradesh return from Kalyan fantastic comfort I wish it will be with me long forever and this is love riding pleasure is fantastic with long seats The lights are amazing.Suspensions are flexible with comfort.Balance and breaking I have never disappointed from it just fun with riding it.,Suzuki
Bike is a very good but only one service center in bhubaneswar. The behavior of the service center professionals is horrible. Also the mechanics are not knowledgeable and they do not provide good service. Also to replace a parts it is taking months together. I don't recommend this bike for bhubaneswar.,Suzuki
What a good scooter.I liked it very much.It's so stylish.Very comfortable. Getting good mileage.Good engine power with 125cc and my top speed is 95.You can trust because suzuki is a japan company that's why i bought it.My scooter colour is red its looking so stylish.Its so good for a heavy ride.I liked it very much,Suzuki
"With the bs6 compliance, the access 125 bs6 gets a fuel-injection system, all thanks to which it feels smoother, more refined than before and is brisk in the low and mid-range. The scooter proceeds eagerly till 65 kmph and the 70-75 kmph is the spot in which the engine feels the sweetest. Overall it's best on my opinion.",Suzuki
"Almost the best scooter available today. The engine is absolutely quick and swift and the height is masculine. The looks are great. The average mileage is about 50 kmpl. The only headlight is weak and needs a brighter light and shock absorbers are a little rigid but if you don't have potholes around your area, need not worry at all. Go for it !!!",Suzuki
Suzuki access 125 bs6 model is very worst and has a lot of defects. There is a lot of failure in this bike.1. Petrol fuel failure.2. Full body is plastic so it's not secure.3. Battery problem within one year has to change.4. Don't give mileage properly 5. These are not informed by the showroom.Don't buy this bike.,Suzuki
"Good scooter in 125 cc segment. Could have given a better design, accelerate it to 100kph and it is still stable. Needs frequent services. The durability of the parts is very poor, already replaced the light switch. Brake bite is not up to the mark. Need to go for the disc brake variant, mileage in city is around 40-50, highways can get easy 55.",Suzuki
"Very the worst bike, a self-start problem, even corrected by a mechanic after 2 to 3 days the problem will come again, there is no option kick start in side stand, it's very heavier if we need kick start we should only use center stand. It's a very pathetic experience don't ever go with this one. Most of the time it stopped in the middle of the road and was unable to self-start.",Suzuki
"Worst bike in 2 wheelers i bought access 125 bs6 in Feb. 2021 after 6 months I started facing self start problem  it would takes long time to start After one month i have to start it by kick Asked service centre they only serviced the bike and charged the battery and billed 400 again in 2 days same problems .I showed it to mechanic ,he told that battery has gone I shocked ,only in 10 months battery has gone. They can't give warranty to battery  I don't refer it to buy others",Suzuki
"Suzuki access 125 parts are not available and very horrible service center in kanla, west bengal...... The bike is good mileage but very difficult to get every part in this showroom.... We kept the bike for 1 week to get repaired the starter motor..... Owe to this showroom manager..... Good for nothing.... Useless management.....",Suzuki
"Poor mileage below 35 km/l,     starting trouble, maintenance costly, totally unsatisfied, Using past 2 years. will not recommend to anyone.                                                                      .",Suzuki
"I already owned 2 access 125 scooties and it is my third one when I ride my scotty I fell energetic it's pickup is amazing better than other scooties & it's my true friend I take into many long tours also & I was the first owner of suzuki access 125 in 2012 than again i buy it's next model the all new access 125 bs3 .Now in 2021 I bought it's bs6 New  model the suzuki is the beast, leader, honor it's a ""suzuki"" Thank you.",Suzuki
Worst experience. Very bad engineering in engine making. My access 125 cc is only 1.5 yrs old.& I run only 4000 km. Only but every time I start to running regular this vehicle. The engine of this vehicle is missing. It didn't take acceleration....4 to 5 times I take this vehicle to the agency prime Suzuki ludhiana but they haven't found the exact fault but repaired little much took the money and send me back. The problem is there as it is... The company hasn't used standard quality engines. Worst vehicle I ever use...,Suzuki
"I love its tourq and speed. The control over is sooo much easy and the space in the vehcial is sooo much i love it and i am gonna buy the new one soon try it, it's very awesome .............................................................................................................................",Suzuki
"I bought Suzuki access-125 Bluetooth edition in aug-2021, on the first month itself I faced self start issue due to batter failure, it was very disgusting in front of all my family members when it was getting started with self, I had to keep the middle stand and kick. Later they replaced the battery. Later after 2 months again it got stuck in traffic due to fuel tank failure. It was a very bad experience I had to walk out to the showroom around 1 km. They have replaced the same in the showroom. But still, now it's been 9 months since I'm using it I didn't face any issues. Performance is good and smooth riding experience.",Suzuki
"Running suddenly off before 1 year my bike so many time problem I am facing. It's the worst bike.6 times one off the same part change but the problem was not solved I am fully mood off access 125 b6 bike purchase, please don't buy it.Suzuki access 125 model bike please stop the manufacturer.",Suzuki
"Sir, ask the person who has been using access 125 for the last 8 years with lost of upcountry trips and daily down. Excellent performance, rigidity and tough with best easy riding experience. Even after 8 years, the engine is damn good and I still speed up to 105 kmph on highways some time alone. And it has given me immense riding. Thank you with my riding experience I am 71 years old still with it and say just go for this scooter. Behram",Suzuki
"The new access is overall a good option .I have been using it for a year now and completed 6k kms . The performance is pretty good . I purchased it  recently after it was launched .The suspension are little stiffer ,which means mostly at low speed and when riding alone the ride seems to be too bouncy,if you mostly travel alone ,then the new access isn't made for you .Overall pros 1. Best acceleration [believe me the acceleration is the best part of new access]2.Mileage [isn't the best but good ]3.Seat comfort [the new access got really big and wide seat,best option during long tours ] 4.It got the biggest trunk under the seat i had ever seen 5. Fuel tank capacity more then 6 liters.Overall cons 1.If you have ever ride the new access then you may know it got a problem with the battery or the switch,it takes few seconds to respond every time you press the start button,this is the biggest problem of the new access,secondly if you give it a harsh acceleration initially then it will switch off ,mostly irritating  in traffic,when i accelerate it with a little more torque with my hand it gets off and then it takes time to start again.2. I  personally don't feel too confident while cornering and during a regular drive. In short the access doesn't seems to be under your control ,i don't know why ,it seems to be over powered ,the acceleration is too sensitive .Riding a activa is better ,it is really hard to predict the limits of the new access .Conclusion the new access would be a good option only  if you ride with someone {not alone}  and if acceleration is too important for you ,i personally love my access,it got everything i need .",Suzuki
"1)the scooty buying experience is super ,the showroom has delivered the scooty at night time at around 7 pm .2) the riding experience is super ,i have traveled  to a long distance in it and also at a very high speed but i always follow traffic rule of bhubaneswar and always wear helmet for my safety.3) looks is super and performance is also super.4) servicing and maintenance is very good by the servicing center.5) company have to attach the led headlamps,and also give the charging wire ,and the digital metre.",Suzuki
"Good for daily use.. Big leg space for carrying things . Brake are good.. Better for city use. Storage capacity is good.   Basic cluster,i am not satisfied with cluster ,even though good functioning . My friend too brought the same vehicle.  He is also having  nice opinion about access 125.. Completely happy.",Suzuki
"Had purchased special edition grey colour in 2018, had good experience with showroom staffs (adhvait suzuki, south end road). Ridden over 15000 km and felt so comfortable while riding.  Looks awesome in all available colors. Average is good. Power and pickup extraordinary in this segment. Servicing needs to be improved a bit. Pros : 1. Value for money            2. Stylish            3. Longer seat            4. Enough foot space            5. Good average,  above 40km           6. Usb charging port Cons : 1. Maintenance and service cost is high compared to other scooters in this range.            2. Brake issues (for every 5 to 10 days the brake need to be tighten)            3. Spare parts are little costlier.",Suzuki
In 2020 it's easy to buy a bike & you have a various and plenty options with easy 0 down payment options Access 125 is one of the best scooter in 2019 well driven One of the best part is look i can assure you people buying access 125 because of look maintenance is not high economic. Digital meter needed.,Suzuki
"It is not very expensive bike. It is nice n smooth to ride. It is nicely designed. Service is excellent, and i have maintained very well.I am very happy with the performance. Good mileage. Very comfortable. Looks and performance everything fantastic. Very efficient. Wide range of colors. The engine is really powerful.",Suzuki
Ride quality is good and comfortable and it's very powerful. However mileage is worth since maximum i have noted 40-42 kmpl. You will also feel less confidence while overtaking if you have used old suzuki access. It's too light that you can't drive above 50 on bridge. Long seat and ample leg space and powerful engine was only reason i bought this.,Suzuki
Buying this bike was the best choice. Riding experience is superb as i use it for daily commute from home to office. Saying about looks make me speechless as it is as it's world best. Servicing of the bike is done upto the mark as i am a new owner of this bike. No pros or cons found currently. V.Happy.,Suzuki
"It is coming under maintenance again and again.Poor quality.I repaired 13 times valves are getting bent, and filter is also do not have life.I have changed its battery 3 months ago now it is dead.I don't understand what is going on.Now after 1 and half year its engine is doing too much sound and its lights were dead.",Suzuki
My first choice was  honda activa but when i got a ride access 125 my opinion was changed.It was amazing experience. It start with great pick up and sound. I can feel the power of engine of 125cc. Smooth riding experience .Longer seating position give me freedom.Experienced technical staff. Enough spare parts in store.,Suzuki
"Worst mileage, vibration in the vehicle, bad service, don't even imagine to buy this scooter. The servicing is bad, i bought it from the mathikere sapthagiri showroom, even after complaining many times the mileage problem is not sorted out, vibration of the engine at idle got replaced the tail light after 1st service.",Suzuki
"1. First i'm watched this access 125 reviews & asked the access 125 owners for the experience and pros and cons then i will go to the showroom  and seen the access 125 ( my queen) , suddenly i fall in love and booked my fav blue colour  after couple of weeks i will got access 125(my queen) disc version for my birthday gift from dad2. When i'm happy my access  speed up to 94km per hour I rided more than 16000 km in 10 months  still now i'm feeling the first day pickup in access 1253. Actually i planned to take a another company vehicle ,  just i  visited the showroom  seen the access 125 if all in love with the access look  and style, and now i'm riding with access 125. Smooth engine performance  with sudden pickup 4 . I using the access last 1 year  i regularly changing engine oil  every 2000km , doing air check up , brake check up That's all, and i fixed mobile charger 5, pros :It's a good scooter in india compared to others. Good pickup, good mileage 40-50 kmpl( i'm riding rashly)Stylish look Cons ,No led lamp in my access 125 2018 model.",Suzuki
"The dealer gave me a discount of rs. 4000 because i wanted the matte black colour in disc brake version's price.After the first engine oil change the vehicle was a complete joy to ride, the 125cc engine is powerful, smooth and efficient. In exactly 1l petrol it ran for 46kms (tested in extreme city traffic and at high speeds as well, it was at the time of mileage testing carrying about 175kgs). In-short the scooter is a complete beast for daily commutes and even slightly hefty tasks!",Suzuki
"Technically scooter is hopeless.Problem lies in its tyres. Back tyre is 10 inch and front is 12 , so its very awkward riding position.Very regularly back tyre gets flat as full load is on back, only benefit is its pick up is good due to short tyre. Always scooter picks up from front due to bad tyre positioning . In short its very bad and hopeless scooter to own ..",Suzuki
It's classic technology of suzuki access no sounds come when we ride the access 125 it's very comfortable in drive also brake's are really very easy to use and after all the most of the i had suffer in scooty is they always get sleep when we use the breaks but in this case my experience is very good about suzuki access 125.,Suzuki
"I bought this access 125 disc bike in Roonwal Suzuki tondiarpet on august 2018. First a week it was nice as it was a new bike, then it showed its original performance. Its performance is bad and consistently engine gets off in thick traffic. Moreover its mileage is very worst and gives 31 km/liter. It never improve its performance or mileage.I give least rating of 1 star and who gives 5 or 4 star should be Suzuki persons.I strongly recommend not waste your money by booking this bike and got cheated...Its advertisement is false and never gives even 35 km /liter. I am using this bike from my home to madras high court around 10 kilometers...Please chose other bike...",Suzuki
"Purchased from cg suzuki. I think activa 125 is better than access. Good looking, however tyres should be changed after 12k kms. Pros: mileage, less maintenance. Cons: it is not meant for long travelling like max you can ride till 1 hour not more than that. It is value for money, as its cost is less compared to other vehicles.",Suzuki
"Showroom experience was good, representative was helpful and humble. About the vehicle, access is a really good scooter for city ride with good pickup, mileage and riding experience in the traffic. Looks are decent with excellent performance and riding experience. Good servicing with low maintenance. Con about this scooter is fuel led should be out instead of under seat which will make scooter even more practical and time saving.",Suzuki
It is such a nice bike. This scooty is having nice look and also gives us nice look on ride. It gives such a nice mileage to go anywhere wherever we have to go.This bike has many colours. I love met black colour. This scooty has disc brake also it is so nice and also has alloy. Riding of this scooty is very joyful.,Suzuki
Worst scooter one can imagine. Very hard suspension which will break your spine. Engine made with cheap materials-it will start giving problems after 15k kms. Very difficult to balance in traffic.Service center will not honor the warranty and suzuki will support them. Buy this scooter only of you want to spend 20k every year for the service alone. Spare parts are very expensive compared to honda and tvs.,Suzuki
Hassle free buying experience. Available in wide range of colours. Comfortable seating. Decent looks and good mileage indeed!! only backdrop is to fill the fuel i had to open the seat unlike the other new models that has their fuel filling point outside. And also the rubber mat should be able to be fixed. Everything else is good. Very spacious seating and smooth driving.,Suzuki
"Overall both buying and riding experience is good and I really like riding this scooter which is worth buying. Comfortable riding position and easy handling, good ground clearance and mileage is also good, it gives good mileage while riding on highway, long distance ride can be covered easily.",Suzuki
"It was deliver at my home the service was good of suzuki as it was surprised gift from my dad. buying experience was little good because it cost me around 62000 on road Ahmadabad when it was launched and the riding experience is very good the pickup is excellent and comfort is also excellent but the part is that it stop when its not accelerated for 1 or 2 minutes,  looks are charming,  maintenance cost is low  ",Suzuki
"Within 2 hours bike was ready with all documentation. It was good experience with gem suzuki hyderabad. After running 1300 km, i will rate 4 points.Looks is decent and it gives me 40 km/ lt. After 1 service .Pro: mileage good , looking decent Maintenance 0 till now. Overly good Cons:sound is not good like honda , suzuki should work on it to give an smooth sound.",Suzuki
This is amazing suzuki access 125. Mileage is better than other bikes. Seating is very comfort. Smooth in driving. Low maintenance. In night driving head lights is very powerful .  Scooter look is very best the performance of this scooter is best .Servicing is after 3000km change the oil and use tube less tyres.,Suzuki
"Good vehicle other than this vehicle.  Good riding. Fantastic look. Service any time available . Easy pros and cons. Handle system nice,  good lighting, smooth moving, ceat performance nice, storing material capacity very good. Leg space very comfortable. Kick start and self start very nice. various colors .",Suzuki
Super scooter. New looks of matt black is super. Average per liter is 60 km/l. Service is very good. Price is comfortable. The riding is smooth. The engine is very powerful. Seat is very comfortable. Head light is super. It has powerful pick up. Petrol lid outside is a boon. It has the best tyres and the disc brake lock and display is super.,Suzuki
Don't buy this bike. Service time is very long. This scooter is not maintenance free.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   not happy.,Suzuki
Okay so we start from the buying option the showroom was a good treat i mean i was welcomed and treated well after the test drive i had finalised the access 125 for i was briefed and also given the quote. I came next day to collect my bike they had it all cleaned and ready for the delivery the also offered me a pack of sweets which was a nice gesture.Coming to the riding part the bike rides wonderful specially in the city where you have to cope up with the traffic the engine is smooth does not make that much noise meaning its well refined and tuned the front looks sharp the seats are very comfortable for both rider and pillion the braking is also very smooth and easy. The bike comes with a very good mileage and which is anywhere above 45kms per litre. I had few issues with the service but apart from that the bikes wonderful and a very good competition for the fellow rivals the pricing is very much similar and the bike delivers fantastic performance.,Suzuki
"I liked the retro style the most in the scooter. Second, it is also very lightweight, Third its best mileage, fourth Its Instant Pick up, Fifth cheapest spare parts and good service. Only I have seen the bad thing in this Scooter That rear suspension. Its suspension will have to be replaced by nitrox suspension. Then you will enjoy driving.",Suzuki
"Every 1000 kilometers oil changed indication is came, handle bar and engine sounds are too high while driving , service center persons are not rectifying the vehicle problem properly, they are oil changing and washing the vehicle that's all, and spare parts costs are too highly, very bad service....",Suzuki
Performance is very bad...Riding is not comfortable.......Mileage is also bad.... I'm getting only 30-45km/l but company is saying That it gives 64km/l ...... What a difference so ....... Don't buy it...... Check all the reviews and do you want.....  So I buy this access........ I'm now feeling bad for buying this.,Suzuki
"Amazing vehicle, good mileage, it's been 3 years using it no problems at all, service cost affordable , stunning looks this is the best two wheeler in this range . Amazing pickup .Very good mileage, very good , comfortable , smooth ride , and amazing vehicle no other vehicles can be found in this range.",Suzuki
"Access is a good scooty and its cheap. Riding experience with this two wheeler is great - its pick up, its speed, breaking system. It looks good and stand different from other two wheeler. But the customer service is really bad and they don't have experienced mechanics for service although its service cost is in you budget and cheap but the quality of servicing is bad. This scooty has one main cons i.E. Its low average and battery provided..... Most of the times access ignition automatically offs even while u r riding and sometimes the electric start doesn't works. At every service i told the service centre guys about the problem and they didn't even bother and rectify that.So guys please think before you buy any two wheeler and i suggest you before buying any two wheeler please visit their service centre for full information because owner's will tell you the truth about any vehicle what they are facing problem or happy with it.",Suzuki
"Excellent performance , looks are to good , buying on 76000 not more cost I have riding continue 200km it's to good service charges not highly and maintenance Overall performance and reliability. All are to good load carrying pickup and braking system in good no abnormalities  sounds come after 200km riding.",Suzuki
"Using suzuki access 125 for last 8 years. Very smooth ride, easy to operate, fuel efficient, maintenance available everywhere. Breaks become loose very often but even than it is not a big issue. Once i had an issue with ignition/ start system which was changed. I prefer to do servicing once in 6 months and remain tension free.",Suzuki
"The access 125 is better for the household purpose, as it's back sitting cover space and diky is more comfortable but it is not suitable for long ride and it's mileage not better as show by suzuki  the biggest problem is availability of its spare parts, i have faced lots of difficulty for finding it's spare parts it is only better for short distance travellers.",Suzuki
The buying experience was good and the dealer was also good telling me all the information of the scooter. The  riding experience was also good it is a full size scooter and the ground clearance is also very much high than activa and because of its less weight it is easy to drive in traffic condition and the performance of this scooter is also good it starts in just one self in the morning and the speed and pick-up is also good .Service of this scooter is also cheap than comparing to other scooter . Overall the scooter is decent it has some of the pros that we have discussed and the only con i felt in this scooter is that its body it should be of the metal rather than the fibre..,Suzuki
Worthwhile and it should be good at condition good looking apt for both men and women performance is good we can go for long rides too we can ride this bike regular for college and job going persons and any bike you can take them to service center randomly for good condition and then will be helpful for,Suzuki
"I could never not stop talking about my access. I used for office commutes, city rides, family shopping trip, and tours. When i say tours i mean serious business. Apart from plains i have conquered lots of hills in himanchal's chamba, manali, kullu, kinnaur, lahul & spiti and also mighty 'ladhakh' these are dream places of almost every serious biker. I have made trips with pillion & solo as well. This scooter just never disappoints! it has conquered, tarmac, sand, pebbles, rocks, water crossings, snow, sleet & altitudes up to 5359 meters (khardung la). I never expect more than it could offer(i know a scooter running on cvt behaves), so my expectations are always over exceeded. I have covered more than 500 kms in a day on multiple occasions. Max i drove 823 kms in a day which included 457 kms on himanchal's hills. 'fuel efficiency' i see a lot of negative comments. In my experience, it reciprocates the way i wring the throttle. If i continuously demand max performance it returns 30-35 kmpl. Averaging less than 60 kmph with no suddne n throttle pull, i was able to extract more than 55 kmpl. In total i have ridden a little 26,000 kms, and i fall in lover with this scooter on every trip. Maximum load laden on this poor baby was two adults, two children, and a full lpg cylinder, it still performed like a stallion. So 6 stars for the machine. Only reason i gave four stars is that dealerships/servicing could be better dealt with. But i guess that is more to do with people, rather than suzuki. I am just waiting for a higher capacity machine from them now.....",Suzuki
"Buying. I had no issue the suzuki staff has given me detailed demo of vehicle before handover key.Explained the service intervals, importance of company regular service, warranty updates.Riding. The vehicle has 125cc with good amount of power and very comfortable with single push start button. This vehicle also has 5 yrs warranty optional which is a good sign for customers. All the engine parts are covered for 5 yrs or 60000km. The look and performance is better than any other 125cc vehicle. Overall the vehicle is good and excellent in performance i recommend everyone to purchase.",Suzuki
"Suzuki access 125 is nice, better scooty for daily uses. It is best for youth because of nice mileage. It's look are awesome but if they give tail headlight, it would be more better in looks. Servicing is best, they give additional benefits with services. Buying experience was good there was a contest in which i got a stylish hand watch of united colours of benetton.",Suzuki
Access 125 is a good scooter and its performance is better than other scooters at this price range.Moreover the one thing i found good is that it goes speed upto 90 and it was really nice for me to reach place very quick as possible.And the one thing that i noticed with these scooter is that after 1 year it takes a lot of petrol.,Suzuki
"It is good experience to buy and i driven so many kilometres on suzuki access while riding i enjoy the torque and stability it has good experience for me and i suggested to my friends and i planning another bike for my father, it's maintenance is capable for every one updated generation is awesome mileage is also pretty good.",Suzuki
Very good scooty for daily commute and good mileage everything promising in this scooty good braking acceleration is top class and offer good quality and very efficiency. Low service charges and low price servicing easy to handle and performance is mind blowing go for it  .Try its bs6 update that's too good.,Suzuki
The access is good for daily riding . Its power is a wonderful feature.But i have maintenance problems in all the months again and again.Servicing and maintenance are poor.The spare parts are not available always and anywhere.Access has a good look. No back pain in long rides. Mileage is only 42 km per litre.,Suzuki
"Hi guys, it's an satisfied scooter with high average and more comfort, from the date of purchase till now am purely fan of suzuki access 125 sp edition with zero concerns suzuki access 125 bs6 still is a well-rounded product, even though it doesn't get an all-round update to its design and feature list.",Suzuki
"It has been more than 4 years I bought this scooter. Now it's been part of my life that I travel to my office every day. I ride almost 50 kms every day. Except mileage all other thing about this bike can give 5 star ratings. Even mileage is pretty good, it gives around 35 km/l. What I like most is pickup and the sound of this machine.",Suzuki
I am using this scooter from last 5 years.This is a very good bike except you never know when and why some time its ignition stops on road and you become helpless.I told this problem many times to service center and they promise this will not happen again but the problem remains.Also other mechanics hesitate to service this bike because they are very aware about this problem.,Suzuki
The riding experience  was too good so far..It is a best non  gear vehicle in India..It suits to all kind of men and women....It give a good mileage when used smoothly till the 4th service best bike to be bought for women..Short men...Teenagers..Students....Old people.....Because it is easy to handle......People from ages 16-60 can use it happily.,Suzuki
Best price in this segment.Amazing scooter in this segment group.Amazing pickup power. Fully comfortable seating .Cheapest service & maintenance cost.Only this bike is catch top speed in few seconds. Better height for this scooter. Every person can put their legs on floor then setup on scooter.Wonderful looking.,Suzuki
Break down four times within one year. Eve the service person can't tell the reason.I think my old activa is better. Engine sound was changed after one month. Power is ok. Battery got complaint after 6 month. And i give it for replacement and got it after one month. Dealer don't have any spare parts in stock.We have to wait for one month if anything got complaint.,Suzuki
The bike is completely worth of money!!Have good performance compared with other gear less bikes. The height of the vehicle and length of the seats gives comfortable to the passengers.The acceleration of the bike is much better than other gearless bikes! I have tried all other gearless bikes before buying suzuki access 125 but at last i found suzuki access 125 is the best in the gearless bikes category in India. The mileage of the scooter is 63 kmpl as per the company but i get only 30kmpl!!!! this is the only drawback i found on suzuki access 125 but i am happy with it.,Suzuki
"Hello, the bike is superb and doing extremely well. Mileage over all 45 to 50 but do not expect the mileage when you drive more than 70 km speed. I could have given 5 * but it seems there is the issue in self start because the battery is 12 volt 3 ah and hope that it will resolve through 12 5ah ( my suggestion only ). The head light is so powerful bright when you drive in dark place ( i did not expect this much brightness from 125 scooter ). Go without hesitate and enjoy your ride.",Suzuki
"1. I bought my suzuki access 125 on 21st June 2014,its been 4 years... 2. I think that suzuki access is one of the most amazing 2 wheeler on Indian road....I have ride it more than 30000 kms and no problem has came till now 3. It has a smart look and it gives a good fuel performance of 45kmpl 4. I service my scooter at the suzuki workshop once in every 3 months. 5. It is most amazing scooter the only thing is that it makes a noisy sound.",Suzuki
"It is amazing scooter.Smooth riding nice pick up. Good mileage also beautiful scooter. Nice experience .Mainly kam peeta hain yeh baat toh sahi hain.Its sound is also beautiful. Nice looks. Especially black mat is a sexy colour.Black,white,red & matt colour is very beautiful.I feel like sitting in the beast.",Suzuki
....Integrator left/right show on meter only one side. Sometime we have confused what is integrator sparkling..... It's a major fault... It's a very bad experience of my life....My suggestion is integrator sparkling on meter 2 side left/ right.... Second thing is sit lock is very bad.... Silencer is very down .... Up/down road is touching his silencer.,Suzuki
"We all know that bike is awesome brand India and the company has launched access 125 with awesome space for lots of lagged. Mileage of this bike is better that the other and this like is very comfortable. If we compare with any other moped bike. Yes it is very perfect don’t worry, road grip is awesome. We you are going with 80 speed but when you dispose brake in above 80 speed. You will that bike is not in our control. But this bike is awesome.",Suzuki
I was buying my access 125 in second hand this is my 2nd bike and really great experience.I really loved my scooter. I love ever forever because i used it 2 years and great pickup and best mileage i like this design and comfort great experience for me and technically i impress for making all parts and used every parts for me.,Suzuki
"Best for city and occasional long drive.I have purchased my access in 2017 august, it was a easy scooter best torque in any rev. Power band seems to be in linear acceleration. Braking is good by the way full stop from 60km in just 2 sec or so,refined engine. Mileage in city about 45 range and in highway about 55.Only con is that tyre loses pressure every month And to be refilled every now and then,but except that suzuki 125c engine is all good. Top speed by 96 km and hour.",Suzuki
"Buying experience was good i bought it in festival season sankranti time, i got good discount. Riding experience is too good. I ride this bike on rural areas& city handling of speed is good , looks & performance are good , servicing is little bit disappointing . It can easily take 2 above medium sized bodies.",Suzuki
It's a very good one in range of scooters.It have an extraordinary look.And i'm getting more than 50kmpl mileage in my experience.And it's breaking system is very good.I think it's the most valuable scooter in India. I'm feel satisfied with my access 125. And in other scooters like activa and all first time only the high mileage is getting according to daily use it reduces .I shared this thought from my friends experiences.Its having high power.Now i think the best choice for an Indian is access 125 Thank you.,Suzuki
"Buying experience was nice as usual after buying they weren't bothering to receive call even. Service us terrible. My scooter was running up to the mark before service. Gradually after 3rd service performance is on down side. I don't know what they did with the ignition parts battery drains to zero only after 5 months. It sounds terrible when we self start the scooter and always need to try more than two or three two start it. Fuel economy was any 40 before 2nd service. Now it hardly runs 20km per litre. My wife is using this scooter she never gone beyond 40 kmph but the service center people are helpless in the starting, battery drain and mileage issues. At the braking part brakes are worst i have ever seen in the scooters. I have the drum variant.  Engine sound is also loud. Engine performance is good but parts used in the scooters are very chip. I definitely suggest activa or tvs jupiter far far better than this access 125. I am regretting after buying this.",Suzuki
Reasonable cost for anyone coming to riding makes me joyful and it looks very smart and also have better servicing center for good maintenance...... Good looking compare to other products. It is suitable for family members for their looking.... Coming to mileage also good when maintenance is correct.. Finally thank you.,Suzuki
Good engine and best performance of this bike. Good mileage also. At the time of buying we had very short down payment but the team of suzuki will be support us for buying this bike. And they give good offer for buy this bike. In a last month my bike was completed 4 years. So i am very happy customer of suzuki access 125.,Suzuki
Style is ok. Performance is also ok. Height is also ok. Seat length is fine. When rising the speed found slight vibration. Besides this everything is fine on. There must be a side stand indicators. Front shocker are very smooth. Rear shocker should be upgrade. Front light are round shape look nice. ,Suzuki
Superb to drive and comfort level best mileage after sales service is also good look to bike in moped is too good i like to prefer this scooter too friend also and many colours available all the colours are too goods for reach and classic looks you can buying this scooter for all comfort level enjoy your daily ride.,Suzuki
"I am using suzuki access 125 steel grey colour for the last 7 years look is very eye-catching.It's very handy, smooth, and requires less maintenance service. I love riding my access and refer everybody to purchase this.Its petrol tank is also very good.It gives good mileage.As compared to other bikes i found access better.",Suzuki
"For old suzuki access 125 model bought in dec 2015 buying experience - very good Riding experience - very bad (Dec 2015 model)Looks ,performance - looks average, performance good ,very good pickup , smooth engine, mileage  average ,around 44 to 46 km/liter in city,service and maintenance good and cooperative technicians at service center , Pros - pickup ,power, engine performance ,mileage ,servicing, Cons - comfort very bad ,stiff rear suspension ,hurts back,old and non appealing design .Small seats neither fit for family ride nor ergonomic. Small oil tank and wheels .Tubeless tyres not of any use .If punctured once you get continuously air leaks.",Suzuki
"I never owned it, but used to ride it quite often. It's a lovely, fantastic and cost effective two wheeler. You can go on a long ride or can use it in daily house hold works quite easily.  What i loves most about it is it's look and smoothness. A timely maintenance will help in maintaining the smoothness of performance.",Suzuki
"Hello guys,I am buying this bike last few days back  special edition black colour. Bike was awesome never compare other models  looking good and best mileage company says 64kmpl but few days test the mileage 50 to  53kpl i am expect first service reach the mileage remaining overall good  refer to my friends also.",Suzuki
"Best scooter. I am the person who thinks a lot of bikes.. Search many sites and read expert reviews. Long term review. And then compared to my needs. And then finally i write all my needs and see is there anyone bike(scooter) match to daily needs. Access 125 is a match for my daily requirements. Like my requirements are luggage carrying capacity, painless riding, breaking is nice another if i and my wife is sitting on the bike if i want to overtake bus or truck or any other vehicle the access give me the confidence to overtake that vehicle, that sudden push is required. That""s why i chose access 125.And main wise it""s only cost me around 220 to 280 for 4th servicing.",Suzuki
I take a trial drive from one of my friend and i feel good. And then finally i decided to take my own. I am going to buy access 125 in September 2019. I feel wonderful it's very comfortable for city drive and long drive both no gear tension and one more benefit is mobile charger that's very good feature Thank you.,Suzuki
today i finally owned this beast.. i was very much confused about the colour.. finally fell in love with matte black .. it looks really gorgeous.. but have to take care of matte colour .. performance wise its butter smooth riding experience.. have only done 16 km .. pros: front telescopic suspension .. wide n comfortable seat.. smooth and powerful engine n pick up is also great. cons : headlight visibility is not so good .. and fuel lid is inside the seat cover. overall its a value for money package.. maintain speed within 60 kmph to extract good mileage ..,Suzuki
"I received the delivery of the scooter before 3 months the bike is pretty in terms of performance but it disappointed me in terms of mileage and also the fuel indicator is not accurate.Features i liked in the scooter are charging point,instrument cluster,under seat storage etc.Also the long seat of the scooter offers a comfortable seating space for 2 people.",Suzuki
1. It was good and explanatory to understand about features.2. Its too good and comfort.3. Look beautiful and performance very nice and smooth. 4. Maintenance not much cast.5. Everything good and we can simply go for it,Suzuki
"Never ever purchase this scooter because it's services was horrible .I put a complain. Since more than one month but surprisingly nobody was concern for this complain rather than without taking any initiation, they have delivered a msg that your complain was resolved...",Suzuki
Buying experience was good and servicing is good on the other way and coming to riding experience trust me this gives awesome feel in moped bikes like the pick up is good in access as it is 125cc and you know the looks are compromising and servicing and maintenance are comfortable and this is the best vehicle to choose for beginners on moped.....!,Suzuki
"I have suzuki access 125 2014 model the the power and performance is best but there are some major problems that are in clutch box. There is a sound coming from it. But, all other things are awesome the servicing is also fast and on time. Like to drive the access. But solve that problem it will be great then. Thank you.",Suzuki
"Buying experience was good but the service at showroom was not good employs does not had that manners Bike is good for long ride of approx 90km to 160km i have ride for 70km nonstop and comfort  was average but bike is good And also have bike good looking And the performance is very good like this thing Some of the cons are halogen light ,seat comfort etc but bike is good.",Suzuki
"Firstly the price scooter is reasonable for a middle class peoples and when  i bought this torque is like fabulous later on it has reduced, taking about mileage is pretty good, looks are decent, less maintenance, Boosting power is good and service cost is less compared with other previous scooter which is used to have. This scooter is good in riding in city.",Suzuki
Access 125 i bought it for my father as a gift it's a white limited edition with all you need best part is access suits young+ old amazing riding experience love it Mostly i used this scooter for city ride and it's perfect and i have used on high way as well it's perfect. One thing i have to say no need for review for access 125 as you can see in mumbai this bike is rocking so you can understand how well is this bike.,Suzuki
"Definitely everyone loves the engine sound while driving, seems to be really better smooth i will refer all my friends and family to buy this bike thanks to suzuki company.There are lots of advantages mileage is good boot space is good large seat telescopic suspension and digital meter it is the best value for money product.",Suzuki
Its price is set for middle class family. Riding experience is such amazing cool than others. Look like all different from others and mileage also good its appropriate 50.  and more on highway. Suzuki gives good maintenance services Its cool to have this access 125 its different from others.........,Suzuki
"This is one of the best scooter ever it has the best 125 engine which gives a very good pickup and from the day i have purchased it i have never felt disappointed ,it has very less maintenance and it mileage is about 50+Love this great scooter from suzuki, people who need any scooter please don't for any different scooter the best is to purchase this scooter.......5*",Suzuki
"Very nice scooty. I have suzuki access 125 which is of pearl mirage white colour. It is rider friendly, comfortable and less maintenance. Look wise it is attractive it looks good. Its mileage is in between 50 to 55km. It has good ride quality and it is easy to ride in city. I also like its matte black and metallic matte bordeaux color.",Suzuki
"Excellent is how i would describe the ride quality. The suspension setup of this scooter swallows all kinds of potholes, bumps and undulations effortlessly.The setup is on the softer side, and is not frazzled by any kind of weight. The 12-inch wheel in the front, is pretty useful in this scenario. What further works in its favour is the comfortable single seat and highway manners which charm you right off.",Suzuki
"Most comfort scooter right now in market, i compared this ride with other company scooter. This scooter is best in as follows 1)best in road presence. 2)most comfort scooter.3) average is normal.4)low maintenance. 5)boot space is larger than other competitors. Believe me i m reviewing this after 1 year use so no complaint about this scooter.",Suzuki
New access is very good performance and its maintenance is so good Its mileage is great and best ride. New access 125 makes me looking good. My family gives good opinion  for this access  125 Use properly by not doing any damages and ride bike with normal speed. Only go normal speed for good mileage for ever.,Suzuki
"I'm satisfied with ride,comfort and spacing. But, after a year, i'm facing issues with vehicle's self start.For every shorter distance ride, i need to put my scooter on center stand and start it using kick start, which is a very horrible task. This is the main drawback i found with this scooter. Apart from this, everything is good.",Suzuki
it gives Italian lookvery smoothlow noisyBut But Butmileage is very poor it give almost 25kmpl for meam disappointed for this.i love this bike for its look appealit gives quick pickupservice center doesn't work properly for mileage at the time of serviceso i request to maintain your service for better result.,Suzuki
The first that comes to our mind when we think about buying a new two wheeler is either honda or a hero or even a yamaha. But i went for the suzuki's access 125 and never regretted that decision. Even the recent ride was joyous as the first one. It never happened to disappoint me in any way other than it's top speed of 88kmph. But hey.. I'd stay on that 50s and 60s for a good mileage per litre. Access 125 has what it takes in this segment and i would like to see more from the team of creators.,Suzuki
I bought this scooter in November 2021 and I am writing this review in July 2023 this scooter is best if you want to use for max 1 or 2 years. After two years the engine has a lot of problems which even the service center people can't solve. Service centers are limited in a city like Noida. Only one service center and its experience is terrible. I was going to buy Activa 125 but the test ride of Access 125 impressed me a lot. Since I was unaware of its service network. The rear wheel is only 10 inches.,Suzuki
"I had purchased this for my wife but once i started to drive myself , i use to go my office with this one only. I feel much comfort than bike and with control i can drive much with much balance. So all of the experience was good for me and  i  advice my friends and family members to purchase the same for their use.",Suzuki
Very very good scooter to compare activa. Mileage is between  50 to 55 km.Just simple word i m saying just go for buying this scooter.I am daily use this scooter for riding.Access is very comfortable for me also my family members.I m truly suggest this scooter for all those who are looking for buying.,Suzuki
Very nice scooty..I have suzuki access 125 scooty which is in matte grey like colour...This scooter talk in the air..When we ride it it's start easily....My past 5 months experience it is very well running.. No issue....The scooter get cool easily. Less voice when start as compared to activa 5g.. Very nice.,Suzuki
"Rider friendly, Less maintenance but parts cost high. Look vise it just attract every person look. Less cost for service don't let road side service. Not for  rough use. Use in carefully once replacement of clutch and belt assembly may cost u around 3000 so use it very carefully best for 2  rider, a very comfortable for couples for jolly ride.",Suzuki
1 there is suzuki has nice showroom in my city. Sales executive and owner behaved very polite.2 it's ride is very smart and so smooth...3 it's look sexy smart and very beautiful and also very comfortable or controlling vehicle. I think i am flying on two wheels 4 or 5. The service station in is providing nice and gentle general services  and in any special case they handle it very easily.,Suzuki
"We buy this bike on full payment of cash and very easy process for buying this bike, I am riding this bike currently its very good to ride, the races are very smooth, and it looks like royal bike times this is very heavy for me. Because my weight is very much low. But I like that and I send this bike for servicing every two months or times every month overall I like this bike or love this bike.",Suzuki
"I have experienced rides on many scooties(including activa, jupiter,fascino and maestro edge 125) but none of them gave as much power as access 125 gave me. Just open the throttle and feel the torque! looks are just classic which does not includes many edges or creases but still its a heart touching model. Paint used is of superb quality which gives you a perfect shine. It is lightweight plus its powerful which makes it one of the fastest scooters in the 125 cc segment (besides ntorq). Mileage is awesome. One thing that is needed to be improved is its instrument cluster as it looks quite old as compared to its rivals, however, strong recommendation to buy this scooter if you want power+mileage.",Suzuki
I used this vehicle for a while borrowed from my friend.Its really cool to drive and comfort for sitting.I never had a bike or scooty till now due to my financial needs.But for the first time i wish to have one like this which made me to have emotional and physical bond with it...Really good.Thanks for the company for providing such a wonderful vehicle for the society.Hope you all a very good luck in future...,Suzuki
"After a lot of research i decided to go with access 125 and that is one of the decision i never regretted.Traveling in bangalore is a painful job but access gave me comfort and smooth driving experience.I have been using the vehicle for 4 years now and my bike still gives a mileage of 40.The maintenance of the bike is minimal, and i have had a very pleasant as of now.Few things that a buyer must keep in mind is that the body is made of fiber hence you need to keep extra care of the vehicle.The fuel capacity decreases with the use of time, but that depends on the servicing.Servicing : it was smooth process. The service center guys were helpful and the servicing provided was up to the mark.Overall i would give it 9/10.",Suzuki
"Buying experience was good because i get great emi offer and well preform and good mileages and very spacious on foot and seat too.Looking wise good light weight.And the best part is servicing is too cheaper compare to other bike.Petrol tank is big than other scooter.Coming to pros Good looking,mileages,easy to ride.Cons:- shock absorber is bad.",Suzuki
"This new suzuki access 125 very nice model with worth of money, good mileage... Smooth ride.. Overall good experience with suzuki access 125cc scoty...I love this company and scooty . Very best experience with access 125. Any one who purchased this scooty please go and purchase suzuki access 125 very powerful scooty with nice colour.",Suzuki
"Suzuki access 125 is having a strong engine of 125cc,about the price its negotiable.Also the look is very dynamic,especially design of head lamp,also fuel efficiency vehicle, another features like alloy wheels, front disc break, led headlights,specious place to keep things in between legs etc, totally access 125 is a complete family scooter.",Suzuki
"Value for money, bike for long drive, ultimately choice for pair ..... When u need extreme power and more pick-up u have no opinion except suzuki access. Market for resell is excellent ......And the most important feature is wide side guard which help you to protect from accident and fractional damage.",Suzuki
First thing i love the all new access 125  because of its mileage and seating. It has a powerful engine i came to know that because i am using it on a hilly area it has a grand and great look and the service by the company is awesome giving a lot of value to me they are treating me as their friend and there is only 1 drawback about the bike  and that's to its negotiating  and it related to center stand.,Suzuki
"Before buying a suzuki access i had a honda dream yuga for 6 years, not once i had an issue as this one. The scooter engine is very smooth and the seat is longer but the pros stays there. The service is horrible. All they care is complete the services and occasional threatening messages like if you don't give for service your engine will not cover under warranty. Less than a year the battery has stopped working. I went to the showroom with loss of pay and all they could want me is give it for service, they call me in the evening to inform that the battery is not working you need to contact battery dealer.  There is no delivery facility and even for a paid delivery it will be after two days,  not so happy with the investment.",Suzuki
"I just regret my decision of buying the ""all new suzuki access 125"". I bought it in feb 2019 since then i had to replace (apply warranty) the tail light unit and the battery. The speedometer stopped working right after i crossed 7000 km. The side light buzzer stays in all the time ( this happens during rainy season) so i had to disconnect it. The pickup is bad, ( extremely bad).",Suzuki
"Amazing Ride experience. It has a different Retro-kinda look, but still Eye-catching. Everybody praise the design in first look. Talking about power, the power is sufficient but the acceleration is amazing. Suzuki claims 64kmpl, but it actually gives around 40-45 kmpl in city, and 50 kmpl on highway.",Suzuki
"Don't even feel like looking at its competitor scooters, in love with this, silencer design feels outdated, but that doesn't matter much, air-filter needs to be changed after one year, no other complain till now, using on mumbai road, it is  becoming part of life for commuting to each and every place i go.",Suzuki
"This bike is really have good look and more space than other bikes. In this bike they have provided travel charging option buyer can easily charge there mobile phones,  power banks in the case of emergency. It feels very good while riding on the highway. Look is really very good, they've provided multiple choices in the colors. I'm really excited to buy this as early as possible.",Suzuki
"Got this scooter home 2.5 years back. Have driven around 60k kms. The buying experience was not that great, might be because everything was done in a jiffy. It was a random decision out of the blue to get the scooter.The scooter feels great to ride. The 125cc will provides excellent pickup whenever needed. The transmission is butter smooth. Handles great by scooter standards. The maintenance cost is low as long as no parts need to be replaced. I get my services done from my local services garage as the suzuki provides one of the worst experience as far as service is concerned. Pros-Beautiful and butter smooth engine. Great suspension compared to activa and others.Good breaking capabilities.Niggle free ownership.Low cost of maintenance.Great mileage. Till date the bike has given me no issues.Cons-Pathetic service center.( atleast in my locality)Spares parts are costly compared to competition.Service centre tries to rip you off.",Suzuki
"I bought suzuki access 125,which has strong performance in terms of pickup, mileage, weight carrying capacity, stability and all. Its less maintenance cost added advantage. On highway it has good stability and speed. City mileage is 50 and highway mileage is 55+.New model is truly amazing. It is best in moped in India.",Suzuki
Riding on access 125 is very much exciting and always a great adventures tour on it.It is the best ever moped (scooty) till now in the market. It has the highest mileage approximately 52km/l and the engine is more efficient which could carry more load at high speed.Finally i want to say that access 125 has best pickup(acceleration) on the road.,Suzuki
"I have been using this bike for around 1 & half years.Pros- Awesome riding experience, nice braking, lovely suspension, i have personally using 75-90kmph speed at long without any trouble, good mileage, family bike, good service experienceCons: Battery not so good, bit high maintenanceGo for it. Enjoy.",Suzuki
"Very very good experience buying,riding,looks,performance,servicing l am very happy customer of suzuki access 125 se. l am very happy to recommend to new buyer, please maintain more mileage this vehicle, please maintain service quality in service center, genuine parts and quality products available in service centers.",Suzuki
My friend has a access 125 and fortunately i used it about 45 days continuously and during these day i was happy with handling it because it has long seat than activa and other competitors fuel tank is big and mileage too so i decide i'd like to buy for myself .But one thing i want in it and that is led headlamp should be fix .,Suzuki
"We bought our access on November 2019 ,11,000 km , still no issues , mileage around 50 kmpl , must buy for both men, women even elder people , classy looking scooter, pickup is very nice , brake bite is perfect, we reached the top speed 104 kmph, smooth ride , floorboard is enough to place an cylinder, analogue speedometer , halogen headlamps, storage box 20 litres chrome finished exhaust is nice eye-catching suspension need to be improved ,service is good .....Pros. 1. Good mileage 45kmpl on city 52kmpl on highway at around 50kmph..2.Disc brake gives you control even at high speeds and offers you stability in city 3. 125 cc powerful engine ,even when three members riding you cannot feel any power-lag , engine refinement is smooth...4 .Wider seat with large storage space 5. Premium looking scooter with long term reliability perfect for a family. Cons.1. Instrument cluster looks very old 2.Built quality is not up to the level 3.Front design looks dated. To buy For the mileage n power full engine Not buy Lack of features. Perfect for a family scooter. Thanks suzuki for the segment leader ..Access 125.",Suzuki
Overall its good experience to buy suzuki access.. Very smooth and high pickup and best one for long ride's.. Good in mileage too.. Extra features like charging port and extra desk for keeping mobiles and other things are feels better... If you will go ride on this definitely you love this.. Its seating capacity is also every good.,Suzuki
"Excellent  scooter in performance  and mileage  wise.  Comfortable riding position , Good suspension and classy look too. servicing  experience  is good but not excellent / professional. It is not comfortable  to get down from vehicle  and open fuel tank.And  braking  give an extra sound  always. If there is mobile carrier, could have a closing  lid.",Suzuki
My buying experience is excellent.The best scooter ever average is awesome and very comfortable.And access 125 scooter looks very good. Service is too good and maintenance is too low. I traveled the long distance via road its very comfortable. I am going to tour regularly and access 125 performance is excellent.,Suzuki
"Suzuki access 125 bs-vi , excellent scooter for all .From 33 years of biking experience i can say it is excellent.1. Buying experience is good. Within two hours of down payment i got the keys invoice and other papers and documents along with the scooter. 2. Riding experience is great not only for me but also to other three of my family. A huge seat and capable suspension system carry the driver solo or with  along with the pillion rider in aplomb and luxury . In city commuting a speed of 30 to 50 km/h is enough and at that speed bracket the scooter feels extremely balanced and planted. I never exceed 60 km/h mark despite any situation or urgency. Some of my colleagues and juniors say it is enjoyable up to 80 km/h speed also in solo. Moreover any person with height of 5'-00"" or more can use and enjoy  it with no hesitation. 3 looks of the scooter is retro type to some extent  and performance is  nice. From very beginning it is giving more than 50 km/l of  fuel efficiency and claimed to be increase gradually with servicing schedule . 4. This showroom and servicing center is reputed for reliable servicing and reasonable costs of spares while needed beyond coverage of warranty . All my friends and associates who have switched to suzuki from other brands in this locality express satisfaction too. 5. Pros are many .A) long seating arrangement b) smooth driving experience c) relaxing seating position with stretched legs on the foot board for the driver. D) smooth and reliable and sufficient  braking  e) perfect suspensions f) led headlight for night riding g) good fuel efficiency h) adequate body weight of the vehicle i) good size of wheels and   tyres  with good road grips j) effective combined braking system ,  cons- nothing found till date. 6. Recommendations - if you be interested in scooters or bored with back pain from long time biking like me, please take a test drive , then you will feel what i want to say , and surely do so wearing a good helmet and shoes at least.",Suzuki
"My buying experience is good because the owner of showroom in sawai madhopur is our relative. Riding experience of this scooter is absolutely amazing. By my side this has the finest engine in his rivals. So smooth and powerful. On highway it easily touch 95km/h. Details are good some old fashioned and retro but in term of performance it is best.Pros are best engine, light weight body, long comfortable seat, and many more. Cons are some old look, mileage problem in starting only.",Suzuki
"Access 125 is very good machine i found. Convenient price. Very reliable to ride.      Headlight can uplifted more for looks. Very low maintenance till an year, after that it needs regular basis servicing. Use this machine for local use not for long rides.",Suzuki
"I bought this roughly one and half years ago. I enjoy each ride on this. It's applicable for all age groups. Will be comfortable for ladies to sit behind. The main advantage of this is its mileage. I got around 60-65 in the early days. Now i am roughly getting 55 and above. I have used all the free and paid servicing. I didn't get any major problems. I changed both the front and rear tyres. Out of my experience, i prefer mrf tyre for both.",Suzuki
"Dear, i am using this vehicle from last 3 years, before that i used aviator, jupiter and activa.. I found access 125 the best.. Because:-1) best mileage 2) comfortable for long drive, as i daily ride for approx 80 km, and only of rs100 petrol get consumed.. 3) turning radius is very less..4) good space to keep the things 5) one most thing i like the weight is very less, easy to drive, not any sound..6) it would be surprising that i ride at a speed of 90km/h  .. It is amazing.. Other scooty i used before get bumbled above speed of 40km/hThat's all..",Suzuki
"I riding the suzuki access 125cc scooter,very impressive. This scooter compare the another scooter is so friendly and i also buying this scooter. Mileage is very comfortable and middle class people scooter. Price is lightly harsh. One more thing about this scooter looking is very  big. So totally scooter is good....Thank you.",Suzuki
"This is excellent bike to ride in highways and village roads.. Service cost and maintenance is reasonable only.. For hill driving, the power of this bike is very good and good pick up.. They are provide usb charger to charge your mobile while driving simultaneously... It is good looking to drive male and female both..",Suzuki
"Riding suzuki access 125 is great experience in the world. The seat of this scooty  is very smooth and excellent. The convenient handle of the bike makes the more attractive. What i have like the most in the scooty is the power of engine and head light . The shining wheels of this scooty also make me more attractive. If you want buy a scooty , suzuki access 125 is much better.",Suzuki
"The buying experience is good because i buy the scooty in the month of october ,2019 and in the night time around 7 pm .The riding experience is good in the night time with an speed at crowded  area  around 30-40,and in the highway by taking care all the safety rules and regulation and wearing of the suit it goes around at 45-60 in the morning time but in the night it approx 30-35 kmph. Details about looks, performance is good and company have to add more features in it.Servicing and maintenance is nice.Cons  are :-no bluetooth support In bs 4 model in headlight no led light are there More color has to add .",Suzuki
"1.Buying experience was too cool showroom gave best service. 2.Too smooth and easy to handle.3.Modern look glossy colour shiny skin and good manufacture.4.Free servicing,low maintenance,low fuel and less pollution not cured voice..5. Stream line structure ,good pickup and best average I love it..",Suzuki
My father has gifted this scooter to me when I was in 10th standard and now I'm in the last year of college.Since 2014 I'm using this and still it is heal and hearty. The best thing about this scooter is the low maintenance and me and my father have used this more than 18000 km within 6 years without any problem. we have  changed the tyres for once only in this scooter and with this great experience we are going to buy the another one soon.,Suzuki
"I have been used this scooter since last 1 years it has good handling and braking, i like the most and the performance is overall good comparing to its rival scooters i hope external fuel lid had are emote operated , even it look cool because of chrome finish which gives scooter a practical design .",Suzuki
"Within a weeks time of buying the bike, the battery stopped working. It's been hardly 4 months and my keys got jammed into the petrol lock and just won't come out. Imagine getting stuck with such a bike and having no access to your wallet or phone as that's in your bike that you can now not open! Terrible experience.",Suzuki
"I own 2017 special edition matte black colour non Cbs variant. Till now I have done 51,205 kms, honestly speaking its a all-rounder scooter, I have used it for everything like touring, off road, city rides literally everything, it never disappointed me just love it and ya it's doing hundred km/h top speed still today(fantastic engine)",Suzuki
Mileage and overall service is very poor. I will say that they will not rectify any of your problem. they will just give excuses. Maintenance cost is also a bit on the higher side but pickup is too good while riding. Feeling is amazing but handling can be better.,Suzuki
"I wanted to buy a good looking bike with multiple features and handsome price for my daughter. This bike is smooth, fuel efficient and light weight as compare to the other bikes in the same segment and very charming and appealing look. My daughter uses this for her college. This is what I feel about suzuki access-125.",Suzuki
"It's a really nice moped stylish and attractive, I just bought suzuki access connect edition in bronze metallic colour. I am very happy with it. It has very good space of seat & very comfortable. Its pick up is very nice. Its connectivity is good and always reminds me for call when I am driving so its very helpful for me.",Suzuki
I don't have this bike but my friend is using this bike. It was an amazing scooty and very comfortable. Good mileage and maintenance is very minimum. Its good looking and stylish bike. Almost good colors for all bikes. There are minimum showroom in Tamilnadu. But it was demand of access bike only. ,Suzuki
"Pick up is very good and stylish vehicle, it is very handy and good looking. Charming colour, it is very attractive. Very smooth finish. Design is mind blowing. Price is reasonable and compared to other company vehicles. Branches are more in all the cities. Suzuki vehicle is luxury drive, etc.",Suzuki
"First of all, riding comfort is awesome but it is pricey. Service center maintenance and servicing is worst in my state. I need to do it by myself. The service center keeps on telling lies when i asked for RC. Its already a year and they can't provide me a RC till now. I got my number plate after 6 months.Performance in riding is great. The looks are satisfactory. The most cons and disadvantage of this scooty is the self-starter. It misses a lot and sometimes it takes 2-3 seconds to start and it makes a loud noise compared to other company and who knows one day it might not start up. The muffler also makes ironic sound which seems like it will looks very odd when it is old.",Suzuki
The battery of this scooter is very poor. Not able to start with self or kick. The service was terrible. No dealer is providing good service. Tried to make the complaint on head office no use. They will not take any complaints from customers. Very horrible experience with the scooter and the service provided by Suzuki. I recommend not buying bikes from suzuki.,Suzuki
"1) The dealer provided us a detail of its specifications. 2) smooth and comfortable but a the noise as compared to other scooters in India.3) excellent performance and condition. It stood up to its mark of mileage. A good scooter for daily or occasionally based commute.4) at the present time my service and maintenance was not so expensive. But oil change must be done time to time 5) pros:- comfortable riding experience, specs are good. cons:- Not for short rider's, noise engine.",Suzuki
"Bought my first ever two wheeler on nov-2016 after a lot of research on which will be best. And i have no complaints with the choice i made access 125. But the services from the dealership were the worst hence i have grown to hate the brand now. My vehicle is in a very bad state because of the services done by a bunch of immature people at the showroom. On complaining i never got a positive comeback either from the company or the dealers. My scooter was in the showroom for a month and a half within the guarantee period for an oil burnout situation at the time they did nothing to fix it because nobody over there knew how to, now when it's too late the service staff has a solution for me with a big budget that i can't really afford. Well this is just a post to inform the new buyers that the credibility of the vehicle alone doesn't count you need to checkout the dealers as well.",Suzuki
One of the best scooter for daily use. I have been using it for more than 3 years and there isn't any issues with the scooter. I just services it at regular intervals. It is the best option for everyone. The seat is very long when compared with other scooters. It also provides a very good mileage between 48-53km/L.,Suzuki
The worst scooter petrol pump problem battery issue fuel injection problem suddenly off the engine while driving starting issues maintenance high every 2000 km service and no response from is service center asking for silly answers over the worst experience buy this scooter don't plan to buy marketing people you will waste your time and money.,Suzuki
"Good experience it's costly but the features are good so that's okayRide smoothly and goodThe look is really nice, especially it's a combination of red seat and black body that's really niceServicing and maintenance are okay but not so good.",Suzuki
"I have the bs4 special edition matte black colour disc variant, till now I have no issues.The pickup of access is amazing,l have crossed 100kmph many times on it,it never disappoints me and I am able to get a mileage of 55-60kmpl.Now it had been 3 yrs I have been riding it and been ridden 27,000km till now, just love it and yes the brakes are awesome I don't have cbs but I think cbs is useless,the front disc offers good bite and the rear offers decent bite and feedback.",Suzuki
"Bought on 21-10-20 in trichy. Buying experience is nice. Look wise good. Lower end performance is not upto the mark. Less than 50km/hr some vibrations are there but not too much. After 50km/hr its so smooth to drive. While sudden acceleration there is more noise comes from the engine. Lovely  cluster with LED lights. Fuel lid looks nice but not convenient, need to kept in your hand while fuelling. Seat comfort is very very good for a family with so much of space. Leg room also more.",Suzuki
This bike is with good mileage and with nice body! the average of this vehicle was extra ordinarily good!!!!And the cost of the servicing of this vehicle is placed at reasonable prices. The pros of this suzuki access 125 is with great the leg space of this is most beautiful. Plus you can charge your phone with the vehicle!!!!!,Suzuki
"Excellent performance and riding comfort. Good fuel economy, gives excellent mileage. Solid build quality. Expecting to have features like side stand indicator, pass light switch, drl, remote fuel tank opening etc.. Very good scooter for long rides because of the fuel efficiency and riding comfort. Handling is also commendable. Overall an excellent bike.",Suzuki
Awesome mileage. Nice scooter. I specially liked its meter console. Its mileage indicator light helps a lot in maintaining mileage. Its new colour Greenish Blue looks good. Its BS6 engine is also very smooth and responsive. Its handling is good. Helps a lot in traffic. Its LED head lamp looks good. Scooter recommended for all.,Suzuki
This is a value-for-money vehicle. I never expect this from this scooty. Riding is so easy in this vehicle. It's speed is awesome. I like it very much. The mileage of this scooter is 50+km/l. A rider can not expect this from a vehicle. It looks awesome. I modified my scooty. The double indicator system should be changed in this vehicle.,Suzuki
Its the best brand available in Indian market for this segment . Had a great experience while buying the vehicle in pimpri chinchwad at wakad showroom. Its very comfortable experience for riding tvs access. Sitting position its very nice as well as controls of the vehicle is very good. Vehicle's height could have been on higher  side for a little bit..,Suzuki
"The price range of almost every moped vehicle excluding the limited edition models is one and the same which is around 70,000.Suzuki access 125 has been the pick for me because:Powerful engine.Premium riding experience .Highest mileage.Great shock absorbers .Hassle free ride along the city.The only thing which is a matter of concern for every owner would be it's high service costs.Suzuki has priced all its spare parts above par value and hence service being a burden on pocket.To conclude every vehicle will have some advantages and concerns but if you can afford its slightly high service costs then this is a great buy.",Suzuki
"it's been a long time i am riding this bike i feel extremely comfortable in riding this bike and it's one of the best bike also it looks very beautiful i have this  bike in matte black colour, it is one of the best bike also it's also have nice Break also it gives you nice mileage more than any other in this segment.",Suzuki

I have also this scooty. This scooty is the year of scooty.,Suzuki
"Nice bike, very much useful for daily commuting. I have used it more than 2 years. The space provided is very much useful for keeping stuffs like helmet and others. Mobile charging facility is an update nowadays to the old model. It should have been given earlier. Beautiful riding experience. Fuel tank is installed in the back of bike which is very easy for filling without any hustle.",Suzuki
Good access 125 buying experience suzuki access 125 but service cost very high not a good service staff double charged suzuki access 125 good looking good riding experience looking retro looking good looking good engine servicing experience very worst experience in all over good suzuki access 125 seat also big.,Suzuki
I have owned this bike one year ago. Easy to ride on a daily schedule. Looks are not funky but looks cool. Suzuki access is  known as the king in 125 segment Services to be done according the service manual .I wish it has a same wheel size at rear too except this. All i want to say is value for money. So i ll give  4/5.,Suzuki
I love this bike because it have classic look mileage is awesome price is also reasonable never sen this bike before just love it. Maintenance is also awesome people are also satisfied with this. This is the most selling bike in India best part of this bike is average people are just loving it. Thank you.,Suzuki
1) while buying the vehicle there was good assist by the showroom also looking at the demo vehicle i was satisfied by the looks 2) it has very good grip also the power is too good but the mileage is really ok not that good i have been riding this vehicle since 7 years 3) looks are ok not that good but the performance is really very good lacks in mileage and it has good grip on vehicle 4)i'm really not satisfied with the service center as no proper details and very expensive.5) pros it's handling is really very good and performance Cons it has a bad mileage and bad service center.,Suzuki
"I bought this bike by selling my old activa. First time i felt sad missing my favourite activa. But as soon as i have started riding access 125 i fall into love with this bike...When we made small races with another scooters...This one was amazing. The top speed crosses 100 easily.The most important thing about this bike is its seating position, its much different from other ones...Its makes you feel sitting much higher. When i talk about the service and maintenance..Its much better..The tubeless tyres must be checked the air weekly.",Suzuki
"Suzuki access 125 is good, the leg space provided by suzuki is nice & better pickup & good mileage but in  design not a major change the silencer design is like in the old & suzuki failed to attract customer through its design. The mirror looks are something bulky in special edition & need to provide better services to customers.",Suzuki
Scooty  is nice to ride. But i think there is some problems in the engine. I don't know what the problems is . I have ride less than 5000 km .It's my humble request to the manufacturer to check this problems. But it's mileage is awesome. I am not that happy but i will manage. No other option. I have ride this scooter. All the scooty  has some problems but this one has not that problems. As compared to other this is the best over best. I think this scooty is the best option to buy in today generation.,Suzuki
"Pickup is all favourite .Mileage part is not satisfied and maintenance is costly.But nice experience to ride.When compared to other vehicles on mileage part it is worth to buy, on the other hand we didn't get such pickup experience and seating experience on other vehicles .I suggest to buy only who not to look for mileage vehicle.",Suzuki
"Just i purchased suzuki access 125 after comparing both technical, utility and cost of other scooterates. I'm happy with the vehicle in respect of both performance and value for money.However, i had incorporated some changes/additions in my suzuki access 125 to get more utility from the vehicle. Though the following actions of mine may void the warranty on my vehicle, i'm not bothered about it.1. Changing of headlight bulb:-I got changed my stock hologen bulb - a.C. 35w with 42w led bulb (d.C.) - cost rs.600/- with slight wiring. Now my vehicle headlight gives me almost 5 times more light then stock bulb.2. Installation of headlight on/off switch:-There is a provision provided to fix a switch in the right hand side (near throttle) of the suzuki access 125. I got fixed honda activa headlight on-off switch (cost rs. 60/-) with slight wiring. Now as soon as i start my vehicle, the front parking lights glow (at headlight off position) thus complying with bs 4 standards. And i can switch on & off my vehicle headlight at my wish.3. Replacing stock parking and indicator bulbs with led bulbs:-I had replaced these bulbs with led bulbs at a cost of rs.180/- without any wiring work. A flasher (rs.70/-) has been fixed along with a buzzer (rs.30/-). However, back side break light remains a.C. Stock bulb only.4. Replacing stock city-cum-highway light switch with pass switch:-A tvs jupiter pass switch is replaced (cost rs. 98/-) against stock city-cum-highway light switch which perfectly fitted. This will work for all 3 functions i.E. City light, highway light and pass light. Slight wiring is done.5. Fixing of engine off/kill switch:-This needs careful electrical skill for wiring. An ""anupam"" brand on-off switch (cost rs.35/-) has been installed just above the headlight on-off switch. Now without touching my vehicle key, i can switch off the running vehicle with gentle press of my thumb.6. Replacing stock single horn with double horn:-Replaced with minda double horn (high & low) at rs.325/- with cut out (rs.120/-) by slight wiring work.7. Got fixed mobile charger-cum-holder at rs.500/- to my left mirror.The total labour paid for electrical work is 1k.I just purchased and yet to know the mileage of the vehicle. But i'm totally satisfied with the top class performance of engine and above additions.",Suzuki
Good price. Price worth vehicle.Smooth ride and good acceleration. Nice brakes. Linear braking. Good look and powerful head light. Sometimes brakes tights while riding in rain..Engine sound changes after the ride of 20000km. Good comfort. Good mileage. The battery and switches are long-lasting. The no. Plate light only damaged.,Suzuki
"Nice scooty .powerful yet fuel efficient.i would not claim 64 but it give 40-45 and i am good with it.looks are good of this scooty. storage and foot board are even more spacious than other scooty. alloys are good and color options are also good.speedometer and instrument console are good having digital fuel indicator and oil change indicator is also available which don't need to remember when to get the scooty service ,scooty will tell itself when its time for service.",Suzuki
When i was thinking for buy it that time i was confused little bit about price it means it's looking too high if compare to others.But i took it. And it's giving me mind-blowing riding experience. It's performance is like it's rate like too much high if compare to others It looks dashing with very low maintenance and i think their is no like cons I'm continue watching here just pros.,Suzuki

So as my suggestion i think honda activa 5g is better.",Suzuki
"In 2018 my father bought this bike it is big very comfortable for two persons , in dasara we bought for good deal , it goes very smooth and good in rough roads also . Looking awesome and these two years work good no trouble . Regular check service is good for health . Pros are mileage , performance and strength .

It looks classy and some vintage look.It consumes less petrol.This scooty feels less weight compared to another scooties in this price range.Braking system is also fine(disk).Ceat tyres will be provided for disk braking system.And mrf for drum braking system.,Suzuki
"i purchased this scooter in 2016 Jan.... riding experience is awesome ,very good in city n Highway too!! if I talk about performance ,even today i can easily cross 90 without much pressure!!! in highway it's really a beast !!! small amount of acceleration is enough we can easily manage around 65-80km .. service is affordable , depends on the way u maintain it!! I'm getting mileage around 45-50 sometimes 55kmpl in city  ,and in highway around 45kmpl I always used shell lubricant and shell or essar petrol,cons -- sometimes if fuel is low pickup is slow , finally it's better than activa in terms of pick up, mileage ,joy to ride.",Suzuki

"First of all the procedure and customer satisfaction of suzuki showrooms in my region ( adoor, kerala) is beyond satisfactory. For a 125 cc two wheeler scooter, its a dream ride for most sections of the society. For decent rate suzuki is providing a fabulous product. About the ride quality, it has got pretty amazing acceleration and suspension system. All thanks to sep it gives me with 48 to 52 kmpl in normal terrains and upto 58 59 on highways.Since i am riding my scooter for last 6 years my version of scooter is a bit outdated in aesthetics. But the recent version are impressive in looks with same engine.The service station provided me with almost 6 free service then. And i have had not much problem with maintenance till date..Pros:Amazing acceleration Decent mileage Steady performance on even on high loads Decent braking system (now with cbs)Easy availability of accessories. Cons:Low mileage on tough terrains and high loads.Not providing maintenance free battery Unpleasant exhaust sound on being late on service.",Suzuki
"I have ridden it 4768 km and for daily use and completed 4 services At the time of buying there was no issue.And access 125 have very good looks, its design, features and power is at most of its segment,but the problem is mileage, yes .Due its torque, mileage always get lower.There's a shaking noise coming from the engine section only  when it's has been kept on side stand. More over,its rides ferociously and i love its grunt...",Suzuki
"Suzuki access 125... A class apart in scooter segment... Absolutely convenient and smooth driving experience 1. Good buying experience... Value for money.2. Excellent and comfortable ride. 3. Class look, great style and finishing. 4. Maintenance is minimum... Servicing is good too.5. Stunning & stylish performer... Could have been better with bigger size tyres (12"" 100/90 tyres) for better ground clearance and ride.",Suzuki
It is a great scooter. Previously i was riding yamaha sz rr. But after riding this scooter only one thing comes in mind that the road should never end and i ride as long as i can. The handling is nice and easy. The riding comfort is unmatched. Though i have not rode any other scooter but i can say for sure that this is the best in its class.,Suzuki
Access 125 has excellent pickup and looks that other bike doesn't has.This makes access 125 unique and good-looking and overall performance is excellent.So everyone should buy this bike if possible.I rode this bike many times and every time i felt satisfied. I guaranty you will also be proud to this bike.,Suzuki
I owned this scooty on 24 April and i am riding this scooty very comfortably. There is no doubt in performance. Amazing average awesome pickup. Average of scooty is about 55-60 kms pr liters. In about 6 sec this scooty picks speed up to 50-60. I loved this scooty because of average and pickup. Amazing experience.,Suzuki
This is a fantastic scooter.It is so comfortable and you will enjoy.The riding is so smooth. We brought it and it's nice experience.The bike looks so decent. Service centre provides maintenance at low cost.Overall it's good choice. Only one problem it little heavier than other suzuki scooters.,Suzuki
"It cost similar to activa 4g which is good according to the features. Riding the bike is very smooth back sitting person is also very comfortable. Looks is little royal type especially the front light and seat is straight so that back person can sit comfortably . Give service 5 to 6 month gap for smooth and soundless riding no other extra charge or maintenance required. Pros we can say look, smooth riding, minimal maintenance and anybody can ride it girl boy father etc. Cons can be for girls scooty seams to be little bit heavy but after sometime it would be habitual, size is little big, not in multi-colour.",Suzuki
Worst sales experience i ever seen in my life. Very next day i observed problem in 1. Breaking system with huge noise while applying brake. 2. Vehicle starting problem.Low quality body parts and accessories.Honda activa is best in class in this segment. I will not recommend access to anyone in my circle.,Suzuki
"Good for everything, looks, performance are awesome, servicing and maintenance good on time, buying experience is very good, better than any other shooter ever seen, the engine performance is very good , need to be launch in a different colours, also the overall model and size is very good, that why i will give 5 star .",Suzuki
It is a superb scooty value for money .It has a an average of mileage. This scooty is one of my favourite two wheeler.Its speed is better but it has little bit of problems  but compare with other scooty it is best scooty i have seen this special disc edition is one of the scooty with stylish look ..,Suzuki
"Hi guys, my good experience with suzuki access 125 good looking, best mileage,very comfortable riding, being a freelance bike reviewer i wait for longer time and took even more rides, finally i find out all the pros and cons. After riding this scooter in city as well as in highway for about 400 km cumulatively, today i am reviewing this. Suzuki access being the highest selling scooter in the market, with the bs 4 norms suzuki launched fourth generation access which named as access 125 Riding experience:The first thing is the ergonomics, this scooter has got ample leg space and it means taller rider are comfortable. The speedometer console along with fuel gauge is decent looking but misses the funky looking part digital console as in most of the scooter in this range. The bulky looking all steel body looks good and both males and females would like it. The 125cc with a maximum power of 8 bhp is quit a responsive and well refined unit. This scooter goes up to 70 kph with ease and with a top speed of 90kph. Braking is not all that good and i would prefer a disc brake standard across all activa model, but the advance braking system this is the added safety feature. The turning radius is decent in this scooter so a lack of confidence stays while taking sharp turns in city traffic.Details about looks, performance suzuki access  targeted both male and female riders with its bulky looks so everyone will enjoy riding this scooter. The speedometer and fuel comes with full analogue console without trip meters. In the fourth generation suzuki the remarkable change is nothing except bs 4 norms and aho feature. Performance as i mentioned earlier is as good as to expect from a 125 cc scooter. This engine is very refined. Practicality is good, it gets about 22 liters of boot space under the seat. It also gets mobile charging port.Servicing and maintenance:The maintenance of this bike is very cheap, it gets six free servicing and there after every 3000 km which is also a very nominal amount. The engine oil and air filter needs to be change every after 6000 to 7000 km and spark plug after 12000 km.Pros: refined engine, low maintenance, fuel economy.Cons: looks, outdated console, under seat fuel lid.",Suzuki
I have great experience with my access 125 special edition. It is very comfortable and very user friendly to handle the bike. This is bullet in gear less vehicle. Get more mileage pulling. In this editions mirror is spectacular no words. Disk brake front brake is very controllable. Luggage capacity is high we can store . Two hangers in front...Any way it is a nice vehicle.,Suzuki
"Riding experience was good and excellent sitting in seat and legs are comfortable in place, if you ride any bike that bike was so much sound and gear locking system was so much irritating. So this bike was good and neat expensive product was suzuki company good. service was very well performed.",Suzuki
"It is a fabulous scooter i really loved it. I bought it before 3-6 months and it was very nice.On this scooter i have gone to pune with comfort. The average, mileage everything is very nice. As the price of access 125 it really gives very nice average. In these 3-6 months mine 19563 km is done. Really this is very nice scooter.Access 125 deserves it.",Suzuki
"1.Buying exp:i m really happy about my choice.This was a great decision after a lot research.2. Ride and performance was wonderful and enjoying .You can ride for along distance below 100 km without any pain on your back. Comforts riding posture. Handling pretty heavy when low speed but gradually handles good when speeds up.You can cruise 60 to.70. Comfortably. 3. I would say this scooter looks great as a millennials i like it very much.Its design also attract new generation youngsters.A complete retro machine.4. You don't worry about the service and maintenance until you ride it in a good manners as recommend.Even harsh driving doesn't make any impact on the parts.Quality of material is top notch(its suzuki just believe blind ).Pros : value for money,more storage Cons: need more fuel storage 8 litres.(as my view).",Suzuki
"Back suspension is not controllable and no spot pick up and below 40 kmpl in the town circle and no dealership in kurnool dist.. Vehicle looking is very good, delicate back side covers under two side foot rest near side cover hooks cut my vehicle so very over action so i am not satisfied this type of vehicle.",Suzuki
"Access is a good scooty and its cheap. Riding experience with this two wheeler is great - its pick up, its speed, braking system. It looks good.Meter console ,style good looks but the front seems little bad ,gets good paint quality stylish easy readable engine performance, fuel economy. One of the best scooty in 125 cc segment. The mileage of the vehicle is about to be 52kmpl. Riding experience is fabulous.",Suzuki
"Feels comfortable and easily maneuverable through tough traffic condition, handle bar could be a little bit bigger and taller because in bikes it may taller, i like that comfort of handling.Final words, Brakes feels good but it locks the wheel and it causes the wear and tear of tyres, if it 130 mm and little softer it will be the best ever in this segment and develop cbs good braking high speed acceleration, very good comfortable scooty. Compare all 125 cc scooty high acceleration is suzuki access 125 scooty.",Suzuki
"I have owned this beautiful scooter in 2013.When i purchasing this one i have tried activa and jupiter also.But the comfort which i felt when i test ride it, amazing. My daily usage is around 25 km.What i most love about it is driving experience which is so smooth and effortless.In my family two more users using this chetak. Excellent and beautiful.",Suzuki
"Best scooter for buying , comfortable riding experience in had. Its looks amazing I love the head lamp and tail light design.Servicing and maintenance is very affordable. The pros are design, comfort,seating position,braking system,mileage and cons are little bit over priced,it's not for long ride, little bit noise from engine.",Suzuki
1. Buying experience was better 2. Riding experience is better than others sccoty's .3. Look is wow rather than all other sccoty's.4. Servicing and maintenance is better.5.Pros and cons ; yes.I like this scooty very much Because it's name make me And my family fly high.I really love it,Suzuki
"Was just a searching for a scooter to buy , then i decided to buy the all new access 125.I was just awesome .Its engine is the most powerful engine than an scooter should have.It gives an mileage of 59 to 60 which is best than bikes.Maintenance free with superb speeding and braking combo.It will never upset you.But one thing is certain, the all-new access 125 looks big, and quite handsome. It's cut out in gracious lines rather than being fashionably hip and doesn't make a loud, brash statement.Suzuki says under seat storage is best-in-class at 21 litres. It can accommodate a small bag, a book or two and a full face helmet, all within the same space! what is sorely missed is a usb power socket; although there's space for an optional power socket, you will have to get that installed at your own cost, not at the dealer, but out in the grey market.What company says that there are no surprises when you thumb the starter; the engine settles into a reassuring hum and the scooter pulls cleanly, accelerating without any sense of feeling strained or without any vibrations creeping in. The engine is a new one - with sep technology or suzuki eco performance, which reduces friction among the moving parts and is also said to improve fuel economy. The overall displacement remains the same at 124cc, and makes the same amount of power - 8.58bhp at 7,000rpm. But it makes marginally more torque now - 10.2nm at 5000rpm. What also impressed us is the ride quality. The wide and long seat is plush and comfortable and it's suitably complemented by the suspension. All sorts of bumps are absorbed quite nicely, so potholes and minor road undulations are taken care of without any judders.",Suzuki
Suzuki access 125 is the new model and classic design it best for mileage and good comfortable for sitting arrangement best colour in scooter and good for space & one press start scooter & disk brake is nice.They allowed to digital speedometer & heavy for scooter they best to riding for scooter & nice looking design and graphic ,Suzuki
"1.It was a good experience while buying bike store people are good they are co-operating well 2.Comparing to others this bike is excellent nice to drive and excellent pickup3.Coming to performance excellent so for the looks of the bike is super front light design is super4.Servicing is good the  maintenance is also nice compare to other bikes 5.Pros:looks,price,designing of bike,mileage  cons: nothing to say till now every thing is good ",Suzuki
"Buying experience was smooth, my neighbour had old model of this scooty. Scooty was first big purchase from my salary . Access 125 ride is smooth with power when push the throttle . New display is cool , it shows all relevant information needed for riding . Best  is power socket ( you need to add one ) in front , you can mount your phone on handle for directions and charge it. Seats are enough for two people . Under seat space is biggest among 125 cc scooty.  Looks wise is great ( i like older one ) . If looking for mileage  it's 60 kmpl in delhi . Service given by suzuki is superb and economical . Best in the range , way better than honda activa .",Suzuki
"When i bought this 2 wheeler, i didn't found any comfort or anything but after riding i felt very comfortable and happy that such an amazing scooter had, in small amount this is great, i feel very proud of it, its pick up is very good, its front looks is very good, i appreciate for it and i have gone many times on long ride it feel very comfortable for me.. Thank you..",Suzuki
"It was great experience that i bough access 125 new model. I love to ride it everyday. Pickup is very good.The only concern is mileage, suzuki claims that access is giving 64 kmpl, but i usually get 38-45 kmpl in city.Rest everything is good. Good finishing and sexy look. Love to ride and i rather choose my access 125 to go everywhere.",Suzuki
I had a access and i really enjoyed the movement while i was riding the bike.It was the best bike ever i had ridden. Its design was too lovely and it is comfortable for youth.Service centre of suzuki is awesome.I recommended to all to use this bike. People who love gear less bike they can be very comfortable this bike.I think access 125 is more better than any others,Suzuki
"Bike is very good, sturdy and low maintenance. Driving access 125 for almost 1.5 years now with no issues. I wanted to purchase a bike with good suspension and i am very satisfied with this bike. Mileage is a big issue, company reported 64 kmpl but in reality it gives between 40-44 kmpl. Company should report right mileage after user reviews, ideally there shouldn't be so much gap in what is reported / marketed (64 kmpl) by company and actually experienced (~42 kmpl) by customers.",Suzuki
This is very good scooty as i own it and run it  runs smooth also its pickup is very good compare to any other scooty in the range also the company is very trustable suzuki like brand is very trustable to have also the scooty is running smooth till now ...To get better experience maintain your scooty properly and get it serviced from authorised service centre for the refinement of the engine. Also it has very comfortable seats and has good mileage also i have done long run with my scooty access 125 and it was superb as it was fun to drive this scooty also you don't get tired because of good suspension...In short my scooty is part of my family i use it daily for my daily commute. It is fun to drive access 125 i love my scooty.,Suzuki
It is very comfortable and i really love it to ride my all family member bought it . It is full paisa vasool . All colours are amazing. I was very excited  when we bought it and it is easy and cheap in terms of maintenance and servicing. It has very good features. It has great under seat storage and very long seat.,Suzuki
"Suzuki access was very good, pickup is great, look is awesome, the lights style and colour of this scooty is superb.For an average middle class man this scooty is just perfect in view of style, view, servicing. But there is little problem in mileage section.Overall it is best for anyone who love to ride scooty.",Suzuki
We bought the vehicle over a her ago the people in the showroom were warm and helpful the checkout process did not take long. Form then i have been using the vehicle daily and it has been nothing but joy to talk this vehicle out the looks are amazing and the performance is top class. Service is also easy and well get out vehicle back within 2 to 3 days ,Suzuki
Just recently the engine got seized without no reason. I got it serviced every 3000 km or 3 months and too good care. But just 2 days ago without no prior intimation the engine seized causing unnecessary suffering. Every time i took this scooty for servicing the mechanics hated this machine like anything. Saying there is design failure of putting the filter on top of the tyre which makes it very dirty and cause problems. The  the engine tuning is terrible.Also i had the problems of scooty stopping while driving the moment you leave the race. Overall performance is ok but maintenance issues are lot.I hope they will rectify. This seizure has caused 6k. Not happy.,Suzuki
1.Buying experience--- is too good.2.Riding experience smooth and butter best scooter in India in term of riding experience3.Killer look i bought matt black colour version which look damn good with chrome glass and leather seat.Excellent look wise4.Service and maintenance are also low cost and cheaper than other brand  .

It’s cheap and best buy against all scooter it has good pickup and average also its good for long distance travelling so my advice is to take all new access 125 it has good colour and it have good features and now they are providing disc in new access 125 so its good for users and now days it has low maintenance and its designed by suzuki so it is best with engine ,Suzuki
"It's easy to ride and can be driven by women and men. Good average.Low maintenance.  Best pickup. It is light weight.Its engine also very smooth so it's sound very low. Company's service is very good. My suggestion company have to change vehicles kick, because we can't kick without bike take on double stand.",Suzuki
"It is very light weight and he position of the mobile charger is great with space for mobile in front.The multi-function key has ignition, steering lock and remote seat release and overall switch-gear quality is also great. It is the best looking two  wheeler among that are available. The under seat storage is also very good.",Suzuki
Great scooter with a superb design and great height for riding the scooter.The engine is very smooth and seating comfort is too good.Also the new special edition with disc and alloy wheels looks great and the brakes are perfect.I already had the new access 125 new version and was so satisfied that i sold my bike and bought the special edition access 125.,Suzuki
"I got delivered in a week. Nice looking vehicle, more like a executive style scooter. Good mileage (around 60km/l) Pros: stylish cool look, mileage, service, performance. Cons: chrome finish area isn't durable. And the seat guard colour also fading quickly. Tubeless tyre is hard to maintain. Shock absorber stiffness will be a problem.",Suzuki
"Overall performance wise excellent. Nice pickup ,shining bright headlamps, fully digitized console, good mileage, low maintenance and easy driving with great comfort.  One thing that i like the most is its looks , very stylish ;designed taking into consideration the interest  of youth , i will rate it as 9/10 . Just go for it good vehicle .

I bought it 3 months before and after getting it i enjoyed it for every day it has that amazing power in it of 125cc pulling you out of the day traffic and giving you an enjoyable ride...Superb vehicle very  value for money  with amazing mileage for 125cc bike with the best classic design with long wheel base good cushioning seat best in class for everything.,Suzuki
"Scooter is good looking purchased 5 year ago no problem at all just some  shockers are not so good services & spare part are easily available looking is much better than others & power is good easy to handle no problem for maintenance, lights should be improved, seats with spring if given it will be more comfortable for old age personal.",Suzuki
I love the look of access 125 and it's pickup as well .It also has a good average and its very comfortable for long drive doesn't give any back problems. It is only vehicle which has so much of torque which is loved by many of the teenagers so i recommend it's a good ride and price is also affordable.,Suzuki
"I bought it back in 2013 and have driven it almost 13000+ kms since then. The franchisee was helpful and was made available in decent time.The look is compact, sturdy and decent in style, seat is at low height so comfortable for 5'0"" people. Less effort is required for moving the handle when compared to its competitors and pickup is also better and fuel efficiency decently to be around 35-40 at the age of 2-3 years.Servicing and maintenance if done regularly (every 3-5 months irrespective of distance travelled) would lead to a better life and lesser problems.Pros: good pickup, less effort in moving the handle, lower seat height, sturdy shape Cons: less storage space, decent in style (look), buttons on handle not upto the mark, difficult for self cleaning as its shape is compact.",Suzuki
Suzuki access 125 new model is the very extraordinary and also the look like old access. The bike is very comfortable due to different tyre diameter . Access 125 is the very comfortable bike and also the excellent mileage compared to the other moped bikes also the speed and engine power is sufficient to comfort...,Suzuki
I'm using access 125 last 6 months i'm very impressed of sound i'm special from other scooties..And body also very good and brake performance is superb controlling...Smooth driving while driving in city roads it's give best feeling ...Fuel consumption also better than the other scooty ..Over all i love suziki access 125.,Suzuki
"Buying experience was not that great the people were only talking about money and when i went to do my first service they haven't changed my scooter oil,overall it was a nice scooter but now after 3000 kms it is giving me 35 kmpl of mileage i don't know what's the problem with it i hope it can be fixed by inner service of the scooter,i loved the scooter always the way it is i touched a max speed of 105 kms/hr overall it's a nice scooter you will fall in love with its first look.That's all i have to say it is a good scooter if you ask me i will suggest to everyone.But please don't expect 54 or above mileage from this they say it will give 60 kmpl katie but it's not true if you're buying then good luck i hope you will keep your access 125 like it's a part of your family and.Love you suzuki access 125.",Suzuki
Its an european designed scooty.  So you cannot experience it with the same  sports style scooty.  Depend upon the personal choices.  Whereas the engine refinement is the best over all scooties.  The pickup is the most superior feature.  The race response is too good.  Which is hence needed in daily usage in city while overtaking etc.  The pocket in front is also very necessary for keeping bottle or main items.  Without opening the boot of the scooty.  Hence also provided a dc charging point which help in charging phone while riding.  U can easily open boot of the scooty by just pressing the key downwards.  Whereas the front telescopic suspension provided a comfortable ride in city as well as off road.  It will film up the road gaps easily....,Suzuki
Self start problem in every vehicle all of my friends having it and they all say the same thing which i have experienced mileage is less if you will sit on pillion seat you will feel the jerks looks are best in this segment stylish features compared to other bikes every thing is better except starting trouble and mileage.,Suzuki
"I have brought suzuki access 125 recently. It has amazing look, excellent pick-up, long & comfortable seat. Very convenient to ride . Addition of combi-brake could have been better.

The maintenance and service of suzuki is not upto expectations , the only disappointment point is its mileage which is not upto companies claim.",Suzuki
"My riding of access 125 is awesome it has great pickup, better handling , good sound  and stability. The suspension is so comfortable that i don't feel tired on long driving instead it gives me peace of mind. The service cost is nil only you have to change engine oil after specific kilometres. The parts are easily available and are durable with Japanese quality.",Suzuki
"It's good scooter it's feel like bike and very good scooter for bangalore traffic More smart more comfort while driving better buy alloy wheel.  If do this very comfortable Need to change oil every 2500kms,check air every 2 days, change brake shoes and accelerator cable every 2nd service..",Suzuki

Colours 7. Suitable for all genders 8.Good for long tours 9. Seat is suitable for a family 10. Needs less maintenance.",Suzuki
Suzuki has recently updated the access 125.  When i ride the scooter you know that power in the engine feels that it needs more acceleration. The average is superb . But there is some jerk when you push it to hard through the corners. The display is very good. The speedometer when started  goes to the speed limit and comes back.There is ample amount of space in the back . I have the special variant which comes with disc brakes and tubeless tyres.,Suzuki
"It was a best experience for suzuki access, riding experience is really amazing happy for its smoothness and freely ride Look is quite stylish and mat finish looks adorable servicing has no issues and it’s worthy and good looking scooter for daily use, i generally use for my daily office i use it normally for daily routinely work from market too.",Suzuki
This machine is a perfect one for those who love to ride. The chassis built is damn good. I have been using this scooter for more than an yr. I rode 20k kms still feeling super response while throttling. Mileage is another unique for a 125cc machine. I have been acquiring a mileage not less than 50kmpl in city conditions.,Suzuki
the pickup of this thing is amazing I mean awesome the looks are good the boot space is biggest boot space I have ever seen in a Scooty the meter is analogue and digital I am very satisfied it is so comfortable and it is a value for money product well done Suzuki thumps up now let me tell you the pros and cons of this machine.  pros. 1 the butter smooth and powerful engine.               2. the mileage is good 3. comfortable and long seat. 4 a lot of boot space.                                                       5 the looks are classy. cons:1 the fibre body but not the full body is of fibre.     2 the tyres it has grip but not that much of grip.,Suzuki
"The vehicle has good performance and can easily carry 2 people, on slopes the engine is almost soundless, braking is good and fuel consumption is lesser than its competitors. The suspension could had been more soft and the seat should had been more comfortable. The capacity of fuel tank should increase and the stability of the vehicle needs to be improved.",Suzuki
"1.  It satisfies your expectations.2.  Comfortable riding.3.  Look is very good 4.  Performance is very good but long journey's it is not good. 5.   Maintainable and mileage is good. 6.  It is very flexible and comfortable in journey..7.  We can carry any thing, it is very comfortable.",Suzuki
The buying experience of suzuki access 125 was pretty good.The riding experience is good. I have taken it to a long route of 250 km in 6 hrs from delhi to rishikesh after 6 days of buying.. Their was no problem i faced. The look was pretty good from old access 125.  The performance was good against activa and jupiter. The fuel tank is much more bigger than other scooty like activa jupiter and all.The servicing experience is ok.,Suzuki
"Worth it and good for students and family....Because easy to drive....Pick up is good...Small trips can be done...Brakes and engine are satisfactory... External body appearance is extremely good, where students can go for photo-shoots...Riding experience is awesome...You can go for long drive to and spring action gives extreme comfort...",Suzuki
I bought the bike in the year 2012 at about 54k. It is probably one of the smoothest and most fuel efficient moped I've ridden. Performance wise it never let me down. May it be up the slope or taking 4 people with me on the bike.The bike is well built giving it a stylish look.The only con i feel with this bike is the fact that the engine sounds very weird after a continuous riding for more than 2 hours. Servicing is very good with the local bike dealer.,Suzuki
"The riding quality is superb on this scooter. Far better than activa. The rear suspension is slightly on the stiffer side, aviator rear suspension is great compared to access 125. Looks can be subjective some will like it some will say it's old fashion. I like it. I just had the first service and the experience was good. Pros: 1.The power is good very good.2.Riding on highway at 60-70 kmph is very stable.Cons:1.Rear suspension is little on the harder side.",Suzuki
"Good response on buying,Excellent riding quality one who has back pain go for it good suspension setup,Amazing pickup,excellent look,top speed upto 95,less maintenance, its best compare to activa, jupiter,fascino,zr ray,All scooters, mileage is 45-50,Pros-best pickup,riding quality, vintage look in front.Cons- kicker that's take 2to3 kick to start engine that makes little disappointed, mileage only 45kmpl. On the hole best 125 cc scooter love it!!!Suzuki product is worthy!!!",Suzuki
"So u are basically seeing this review for suzuki swish and access both which i suppose are very fast, quick acceleration and nice mileage. Swish is now discontinued, only suzuki access is sold now. The scooter is very comfortable and cheaper at least rs.5000(if you have food bargaining skills)  than other 125cc scooters. Servicing and maintenance depends on the nature and behaviour of dealer. Pros- Cheap and good for middle class people who value money. Fast acceleration Cons-Accessories are not found as easily as activas.",Suzuki
"1. Access 125 is a great value for money. As the advertisement said ""kam peeta h"" yes it actually does.2.  With it's great stunning retro looks makes it more appealing and eye-catching. In my opinion it looks better than vespa too.3. Its 125 peppy engine is not fast but furious too. What i usually do when i was in good mood i just open full throttle at a time and it literally stood up like anything and makes me more naughty.Brakes are awful and suspension are effortless literally.4. Astonishingly  it maintenance like activa although less than it's competitor.5. Last but not least i found too many pros but still hard to find cons.",Suzuki
I have took this scooter  3 months before Awesome experience and had a great joy to drive that I took a white colour one it is Awesome just Awesome ...........  and also smooth to ride and have efficient space to sit and for leg space Awesome like the scooter I prefer  you to take the scooter and enjoy your ride.......,Suzuki

Power, performance, average, and sexy look..100% value for money.I love its colour and all features .Suzuki access beat all bikes comparing to its by performance look and power.My family love this bike as its very affordable and trust worthy.Choose right and ride tension free.",Suzuki
"Surely this access 125 is a superb scooter in suzuki for men and women, superb mileage and superb pulling, compared all, the engine remains the same as the original access 125, but suzuki has equipped the updated scooter with what it calls the sep technology, or suzuki eco performance. In essence, what this technology does is reduce friction among the moving parts of the engine, providing better performance, more refinement and even improved fuel economy. Suzuki claims the new access 125 will offer mileage of up to 64kmpl. Actively low maintenance , in total access is emperor among scooter.",Suzuki
1 it’s very comfortable 2 riding experience awesome also nice pickup and mileage 3 its looks decent i like it’s mat black colour it’s look fabulous 4 ok every vehicle need to maintenance Everything is good compared to other vehicle like activa 4g and tvs jupitar they both are really good but i personally like suzuki acces 125,Suzuki

"After riding my old honda aviator for 7 years i finally decided to buy a new scooty as my parents didn't allow me to buy a bike.I was looking for a scooty which is light in weight and powerful enough and doesn't looks girly , searched a lot , went showroom to showroom and finally i saw suzuki access 125 special edition ( matte black) love at first sight ! Took a test ride , and believe me the difference between this and my old scooty was more drastic than anything you name. I bought the scooty and it's been 4 months this scooty is great , servicing is free for 2 years so no worries :d I compared it with my friends scooty's too but none of them could stand against mine :)",Suzuki
Buying experience was good but more best was experience of its power it will take you to a whole new level and remember about the sound that makes while starting rest are all perfect trust me nail it or break it whether you go for best or you go average it's up to you you decide what you want remember to enjoy riding do visit suzuki showroom and test drive then decide which is best,Suzuki
"Awesome scooter for daily use , no issue at all. Perfect in traffic and parking. Spacious diki for keeping helmet,rain coat and shades. Seat is broad enough for two.Foot rest is also very comfortable.The only drawback is silencer pipe is weak enough for rain water ,if rain water gets inside silencer pipe then you have to change silencer pipe",Suzuki
"Awesome experience with suzuki access125. Gives super ride.It gives the super average. Its has been 4 years i am dealing with suzuki access 125 from 2012.I  daily used suzuki access for office used.It has been more relax ride,more comfortable ride,and more mileage give vehicle.

"After quite some research on several scooters in this segment, i chose this over others for its value for money, reliability, fuel economy, long-term maintenance, adequate power, and style. This one has made a name for itself. After quite some time suzuki has revised their premium scooter and they have ticked all the boxes as they did earlier. I test drove mahindra duro, honda activa 125cc, hero maestro before access 125. This one felt smoothest of them all. I own it for 5 months now taking it daily to the office and into the other parts of the city during the weekends.Pros:* big boot space* smoothest engine in the segment* fuel economy (49-50kmph on average)Cons:* fuel tank capacity could have been higherSuzuki showrooms and service centers are plenty nowadays, it was a hassle-free experience for me.",Suzuki
Well calling it a queen because it had ridden me all the way like king in city{so its king's queen}Purchased it in dec 2014 just after my marriage for city usage and since then it is with me as my second wife helping  me daily to make my life lot easier. overall a nice bike with nice handling in city easy to maintain with descent fuel economy.Area of improvement- brakes ,Suzuki

Pros already told in upper pointsCons that i have heard it's sound problem after being day by day old.",Suzuki
"I researched so much with all other scooters available in the market, but finally took this scooter. Coming to buying experience it was good . Riding is totally awesome. Even i am very comfortable with access 125 riding  compare to higher end two wheeler. Look and performance no doubt at all, it is having very decent and royal look. Still i gone through two services, as servicing was good. Pros all as mentioned above.Cons: vehicle body is fiber, if it was supposed to be metal body added advantage. mileage is very less as i am getting only 25 to 28 kmpl. Don't know after  all services it may give good mileage, lets see. ",Suzuki

"It's affordable not too expensive and worth buying.It's a very comfortable scooty comparing to other scooters with hydrolic suspensions.Talking about looks it gives you a classic look specially the special edition version, the steel mirrors add a classic look to it and enhance it.The most important and very good thing about this scooty is its mileage of gives a very good mileage it still gives me a mileage of 55-60 kmpl depending upon the condition you keep.Servicing it within 1000km n maintenance its a very low maintenance scooty that's the good thing about it.I am enjoying the ride no corns it's a very comfortable and a good scooty.",Suzuki

"Access 125 is one of the best bike i have ridden till now, one of the best product of the suzuki till now. I had bought it one and half years back and till today it haven't made be pay extra than the normal service charges. But only the problem is that u don't get its parts outside the service station ",Suzuki
"Retro head lamp .. Beast like pick up in commuter scooter is really amazing and scary . What a pick up access as with a suzuki easy start system and eco concept like sep make this scooter much more good , amazing boot space and cabin space and mobile charging socket is brilliant suzuki push lock ignition is also new overall an amazing scooter from suzuki am a proud accessian ",Suzuki
"Am owner of suzuki access 125. I really hope share something about my access 125. Access 125 give very good comfortable ride the main advantage of suzuki access 125 is its not jerk while we ride on high speed ,its very controllable also on high speed ride .Its really awesome for young people am sure you ill surely happy ride access 125",Suzuki
"A slight upgrade on the older version on the access, the new 125 definitely retains the most of the positives from it's predecessor. However there a few things which make the bike a little cumbersomepros 1) priced competitively2)a very smooth and refined engine3) fuel efficient 4) feels powerful and stable at all timecons1) doesn't come with a guard around around head and tail lamps2) seat is a bit too high for the average rider, woman may find this a bit inconvenient 3) suzuki don't offer the best service experience",Suzuki
Suzuki access is the best family scooter because of more storage larger seat.The design is a part in which suzuki has done a great work the design is very classy. The chrome used in headlights are very interactive. It is very light scooter which also improve milage and pickup of the scooter.   Performance the pickup is good engine is very smooth the overtaking is good and break suspension is also nice.The lights and indicators are very excillent i use this scooter of around 1000 km and i did 2 service and after this scooter give great milage and performance the cons of scooter account to me is-not full metal body display -do not have external fuel filling-automatic lights missedthe cons are very minor but if you want a family scooter then go for it,Suzuki
"Smoothly, fast, or you can say amazing... Words are not sufficient to feel the driving experience of access 125. I had driven all d other bikes but some backwards may b there for every brand. But for this undoubtedly nothing bad. Light weight.Comfort.Fast.Easy handling.... Over all fantastic.",Suzuki
This vehicle is extremely smooth and it have a good engine noise which i like. Coming to the brake the get loose a bit quick when u buy so time to time servicing is very important.It comes with huge beautiful colour.The down point is that it doesn't have that good average. Suzuki say that it give 64 kmph average but trust me 50 is more than enough. Coming to the vehicle it's very spacious a big space inside seat.And also has a good look the glossy one.So that's it ,Suzuki
After buying the vehicle gave a feedback stating that it has a carry hook in bottom of seat and there is no charger holder. Both are rectified in r&d and recent vehicles has got that. Many would have given the same feedback and it is great to know that even minor feedback are noted down. Even after service is really good and if you constantly change the break oil vehicle is so perfect to ride,Suzuki
Nice bike for the office purpose where we can carry many things with convenient space for other things also it has superb shocks for comfortable drive and it has auto lamp with brighter and luminent power. It is also good bike for women where it comes with good efficiency and good quality of tubeless tires for better road grip.,Suzuki
"Suzuki means two things for Indians, mileage and dependability and these two things the suzuki access 125 provides .Its a fun to ride scooter and u wont feel any exhaustion even though going for a long ride .Its a good looking one and stands apart amongst its rivals like activa 125 , vespa , aprlia etc. Maintenance   of this scooter is also pocket friendly and spares are also easily available . Only con that i have  faced is the lack of customer support from suzuki showrooms and service centers . Rest all is good with this machine ...Surely its a daily commuter ..And a perfect machine for Indian roads.",Suzuki
"First of all, just to let you guys know, this is the 1st 2-wheeler i have owned. My needs were pretty simple, i needed something to commute within the city hassle free. So what good than a scooter, no frequent gear shifts and clutch controls, yes i am lazy.Suzuki access was the most powerful scooter withing the segment with decent looks and mileage too.I was able to get a mileage of around 35 before 1st service and then it went all the way up to 43kmpl.Riding experience on this bike is decent too. Nothing special except the torque, but you wont be disappointed as well.There is no running cost for this except your fuel and maintenance cost is within limits as well.Pros : good brakes, alloy wheels on top model, more torque, good mileageCons : back aches after a period of continuous driving, but i guess that is a problem with all scooters. Go for a decent bike if you are planning to long period drives.Overall its a decent package which won't disappoint you. Go for it :)",Suzuki
"It has a very good mileage on highway and also in market the brakes are also good in the disc brake special edition access 125,it is much better than activa and duet and also if anyone buys this its so good in riding the seat is very comfortable and there is much space for keeping some things it also have a charging port and its air cooled engine such a great i cant say more good things about this bike , i prefer every rider to buy this bike only.",Suzuki
Best budget bike for daily use .....You will enjoy it in city .......Very comfortable very easy to handle  ...Till now no complain or problem occurred.......I have used 2 yrs and till now pickup is good.......Best part is it have a better grip.....It never let me down....Lastly i want to say that just buy it..Don't think.Just get it.,Suzuki
"I bought this bike for 69k in my home town. Ride for nearly 4200 kms. Enjoying ride daily. Pick up is very good. Very good seating space. Looks are good and going to performance it's awesome. I'm getting mileage of 47-52 kms depending on roads. 47 minimum guarantee. Initially got 42 kmpl gradually increased after 3 servicing. Guys go for suzuki access 125. It's better than activa 4g. I drive both bikes. You will enjoy riding in suzuki 100%. Coming to mileage more than activa and jupiter. When coming to looks, better than any bike in this segment. Servicing is very good and the showroom guys are very helpful in every move. Just go for it... ",Suzuki
"The engine is pretty smooth Mileage wise you can expect about 55-60kmpl if ridden properly The only problem i faced is when sudden raise of the bike, the front wheel of the bike feels light and if u r not careful it may even raise up The looks are amazing  it feels classy The ride experience is simply amazing Great comfort for the rider and for the pillion as well It exceeds in every category when compared to activa",Suzuki
"I have used access 125  last 6 months.It is very useful anywhere.Very comfortable. I have also enjoyed that rides for long drive.Its give best mileage.It's look very sporty and attractive.It uses all the families like older person,mom,children, students etc......  suzuki access 125 company gives best servicing at every time.",Suzuki
"Initial impression with this scooter is great. Ride quality is superb. Seat is very comfortable. My father purchased this scooter on occasion of Diwali for me when i joined vodafone. Pick up off this scooter is awesome like a engine with 125cc has such great pickup. When after 1 year 9 month performance is nice this minimal noise little more than honda activa. Our favourite auto brand is suzuki. All of our vehicles are suzuki made like suzuki 150r,Suzuki sling shot, suzuki access 125",Suzuki
Using access 125 from last 3 and a half years amazing vehicle service price is best compared to others good balance of weight good power better engine then any other worth a lot buying it every thing is good and i don't have any problem against this scooty if you are thinking to buy it its my opinion to buy it,Suzuki
"Buying experience is badRiding experience is to goodFeeling like finding sports scooterLooks is amazing, it's finish, seat color (leather) mirror set, chrome headlightMainly it's riding comfortable.Services are expensive, maintenance cost very low compared with other.Pros storage capacity, cons nothing",Suzuki
"Each & every thing is ruff & tough , very good average,rocket pickup, overall it is awesome.. Riding in city is very good, no back pain at all like (activa) looks are eye catching ,performance is in his name suzuki no one can meet his performance, although service is little bit slow just because of rush at service centre & maintenance is very low.",Suzuki
I bought this bike before diwali and buying experience was awesome. Bike has nice built & ride quality. Also it gives fine mileage of around 50kmpl. For the first service we paid 200rs for only engine oil. It's a light weight bike which is very good for old age people and for ladies. New design makes it a premium bike of this segment. Very happy with access 125,Suzuki
"Amazing scooter. Far better than activa and many other models. Good pickup and good mileage. I am riding this bike from march 2016 and was very happy with bike engine. Service parts are easily available. I get mileage around 45 in traffic.Riding experience with this two wheeler is great - its pick up, its speed, breaking system. It looks good and stand different from other two wheeler. But servicing sometimes is very poor. But it can be solved by raising a ticket online.",Suzuki
The scooter is great in terms of build quality and looks it has 124cc engine which helps to get an instant pickup and if we drive in economy mode it is fuel efficient also It's pros are 1.Its looks 2.Its performance  3. Its comfortIt's cons are 1.It has the fuel tank under the seat 2.It's have a charging point completely open which for me is bad because i often forgot to take my phone and i have to run for it a lot 3.It has a digital meter so in rainy season we have to  take care for it ,Suzuki
"A powerful, comfortable and fun to ride scooter.I am very huge fan of this scooter.Because it's pick up is like 150cc bikesAnd it is very comfortable to ride.I have old model scooterSuzuki access 125 se. Can overtakes any scooter which have 125cc engine1. Amazing pickup2. Very comfortable3. Good looks4. Large place in boot5. Stylish lamps6. Comfort for all generationsReally i have satisfied with mileage 55+, smooth riding . I am feeling suzuki so much comfortable for family and single. Its so smooth on riding even tough crossing 60kmph without noisy. I feeling comfortable and happy.",Suzuki
1.Buying was very simple i went to show room and just checked out this vehicle and booked it. It's that simple.2.Ride quality is okay but response time to accelerate is amazing.And top speed is also pretty nice.3.Look is just classic and about performance i have told you before.4.Yea it's a vehicle which wants more oil and fuel for more speed.5.# pros1-classic look and feel 2- absolutely powerful#cons1- not so fuel efficient2- makes too much noise,Suzuki
"First of all it's worth. While riding the bike feeling very comfortable. It's easy to control the bike at very high speeds because it has good braking system than other bikes.Bike is looking very cool and stylish, especially front head light part.Bike has more storage space in front and inside of bike.  Performance is optimal.Servicing and maintenance cost is moderate.",Suzuki
"The bike is best i like it very much pickup is good and the speed is awesome looks, from front is classy, i like it, this is my best bike.I think this is best bike which suzuki made ever . And i am very very satisfied by this bike i love it . Please buy this if you like to ride bike . Thank you suzuki i love it",Suzuki
"Great pickup,looks and avg mileage of 50kmpl .I would suggest to go for pearl white which is the best looking in this model and i recommend it with my heart ..All the best for the safe journey .The only disadvantage is you have to spend 70k for on-road price..But as i said pickup is best in terms of scooters and i feel value for your money...Thank you keep checking my reviews",Suzuki
"This is my experience with suzuki access 125(2017)After lot of research i stuck between honda activa and suzuki access125 later i went through the specification in bikewale.Com i ended up with suzuki access 125 so later next day i went to suzuki showroom and booked it...So after 3-4 days i got my bike...Wow it was stunning because i booked a matte grey it's was cool it was my buying experience later ...After getting on to bike it's was so comfortable as i'm 166cms due to 12 and 10 cms   wheel base and 166+ cms ground clearance it's feels good when i switched on the engine it's so good later my first ride with it till home was superb it's acceleration is fast it's can be bullet of scooter and duke in pick-up i loved itMy experience10000+ kms Pros --Build is superb Performance is ultimate Mileage -- i'm getting around 48-53 as i commute daily to collegePick-up i had already mentioned pickup us super in the access that's the main reason i bought access 125Riding experience is smooth as it's linear transmission Mobile charger at convenience place Cons --I feel breaking system is little bit backed because if you are around 60 kms it's well and good but if you doing it with 65+  then bike lacks confidence Overall it's a good bike to commute in city for it's pick-up, mileage,and smooth riding experience Maintenance is pretty much low as it's not super-bike, for drum version of brake its actually maintenance is very low , company offers 4 free service ",Suzuki
"Some feature additions have been made to the second generation suzuki access 125 to make it more practical. These include a front storage pocket, optional dc socket, 21-litre under-seat storage and an improved instrument cluster. The new instrument cluster is a semi-analogue unit that also shows two trip ...",Suzuki
Buying experience is nice..........Riding experience is great......... Looks awesome better than other scooties...Performance  wise good but mileage is not good when i purchase executive told me access 125 mileage is much better 66km/l but actual mileage is 40 ....Only free services are reasonable and paid services are so high ..,Suzuki
"I enquires all the scooters with my friends. Really speaking no vehicle is perfect. We have to see only minimum cons .So in this segment only access 125 is minimal cons.So rely on my opinion without any doubt. Because i enquired for 6 months . I see all the scooters like activa 125, fascino, jupiter, ray, maestro .In all the matters access 125 is better option",Suzuki
"I bought suzuki access 125 in the year 2016 it is being human edition as i am biggest fan of salman khan. I love everything about the bike, bike ride is smooth .. As it has 125cc engine gives me more power by which i rock on roads. Bike can easily goes upto 80 km/per hr. It has low price maintenance. Pros :-Low maintenanceGood suspensionsSmooth ridePowerful cons :-Less average than expectedMakes too much noise That's all ... ",Suzuki
"Access is a very powerful scooter comes with 125cc engine. The scooter is well designed. Aerodynamics are good which helps to provide stability over control. While driving the scooter allows you to feel light as it has a smaller shaped handle than other scooters. The meter console is quite good and very simple. There is a speed indicator, fuel indicator. As it comes with 125cc engine the mileage of access in low compared to other 125 cc engines. Ii gives the mileage of 25-30km/hr in city. The small and light handle gives you the perfect handling. You can easily go through sharp turns. Access 125 is a good performer if you can neglect the low mileage and high cost.",Suzuki
"I have purchased this bike on Oct 2017, completed 4 months,Used it as much i can, for short tour as well for long tour (450 km longest tour in a day).Good points:1). Look , its look is awesome nobody can judge it is only 125 cc, it look like as bigger engine. It's stylish look make you love this scooter 2). Engine: it's engine is worth, i have kept speed on highway 60 to 80 km , & it never vibrate, remain smooth which tells its engine is awesome.3).Average: 40 km\l to 45 km\l depend on how you drive it. But sure good average than other.4). Price: i think in this price this is the best scooter which you give everything.5). Comfort: very comfort to sit you as well as you can carry other on its back seat . As it's long & comfort than other scooters as u can take with you on the back seat.Bad points:1). Lighting: in the night, it's head light focus is not on road so i think so you have to be a little careful when you ride So finally if you are going to purchase a scooter near a range up to 60000 , then definitely you have to buy it rather than other scooters, i have used this for office (short route) & long route, & after 6000km journey i can say that it never hurt me or give me any problem in running time which is great!",Suzuki
Access 125 is a pleasure to ride its pickup is great and smooth riding comfortIt’s fuel efficiency is good overall it’s giving 48 -55 kmplBest part is the price n metal bodyI have taken blue colour it’s so goodServicing is also very good i haven’t found any negatives for access 125Previously i used maestro that’s good but the service is so horrible but access 125 is the best unisex vehicle,Suzuki
"Look and design is pretty good,driving experience is very smooth. Good balance.Mileage in city markets about 35km/litre.Mileage in long ride about 50km/litrePros:- good design good mileage big seatCons:- no full metal bodyOverall it's a good experience with my suzuki access 125.",Suzuki
"It's so powerful and comfortable when we are ridding the access 125. This is good choice for a family everything is good. While we are came the showroom for buying a gixxer but my dad like this access 125 so much and me too so then my dad bought this, first time i am ridding the bike i thought  it is bad but it's nice",Suzuki
"Excellent shocks observers , excellent colours, excellent mileage when compared to maestro, low maintenance , braking system superb, it's good for family ,students , and for every one , lightning is good , and service was also good , also available in easy emi  , and also showroom allows exchange offer",Suzuki
This bike is just awesome with on road average of 38 in a hilly area.. And for long trips this gives a fantastic average of about 48.. Had an accident with this bike and the bike suffered no loss.. I bought this bike from showroom in solan.. The staff of the showroom is very good.. This bike can be accelerated to about 70 kmph speed with a load of about 150 kg at half race.. Over-all this is superb,Suzuki
"Superb and the best non gear vehicle with good looks, quick pickup and  best mileage. Provided with good service quality and low maintenance charge. Sale executive was up to the mark for me for narrating all featuring related to the bike with all pros and cons and service executive was fast grasping for solutions what i wanted.",Suzuki
Good look and stand out design. Boot space is good. Mobile charging port and bottle storage added features.  Seat is comfortable. Good mileage. Overall an awesome family scooter. Zero   vibrations. Engine performance is brilliant.  Disc brake version is recommended for better road  grip and braking. ,Suzuki
"It is very nice and comfortable to youth and old people as well.Access is a good scooty and its cheap. Riding experience with this two wheeler is great - its pick up, its speed, breaking system. It looks good and stand different from other two wheeler. But the customer service is really bad and they don't have experienced mechanics""we very can use this bike ,it's family bike ""I am very huge fan of this scooter. Because it's pick up is like 125cc bikes and it is very comfortable to ride.I have old model scooter suzuki access",Suzuki
"I wanted to take aviator but i saw review on this site i,e bikewale and took access 125 and now it's awesome. My some friends took aviator but due to less comfort and high maintenance they are suffering now.Access 125 has low cost maintenance and mileage is 52kmpl as per my experience and i have aviator bike too but it doesn't have the power like access",Suzuki
I like this scooter is because its maintenance is very less and also i get 45km/ltr its also very good I prefer black and the power is also good the main thing is its  very cool and the service center is good i get on time delivery the main thing is this scooter is not getting more complaints i prefer suzuki access 125 i love it,Suzuki
Just go for access 125Super body...Super mileage...Long seat..Best service..Best in class performance...Mobile charging ...Best self start... Only a click.. To start...Loved it... You won't find this in any other in this class..Good look.....Tough body.....Digital meter(kms)....More mileage for less petrol...Loved it from all angle....I suggest you to buy it...,Suzuki
"Very smooth to driving.No pain in body to drive long time.My suggestion, perfect scooter of this year. Please introduce more colours and changing to more stylish.And front module little bit change required.This scooter really giving 56 km per litre and low maintenance spare parts in showroom .Please reduce rs 5000 because poor peoples defiantly buy this scooter....",Suzuki
Access 125 limited edition is awesome bike the mileage of the bike is awesome and pick up of the bike.Is so quick it can reach 60km/h in just 6 seconds which is awesome looks of the bike is classic i have bought white one service is good and doesn't have any cons in the bike the bike has all pros in it must buy bike.,Suzuki
"The showroom delivered the bike as per the delivery date.The people in the showroom are so kind and service is also good.The riding experience is too good when compared to activa. In access the handle bars are so handy and gives better riding position.The looks are better when compared to the older access.Maintenance of the bike is so easy and cheap and service is very good.Pros:when coming to pros,the bike gives better mileage and has a large under seat storage which will be very useful when going for long rides.Cons:the bike stalls when acceleration is not given sometimes.Other than that it is a high performer in its class",Suzuki
"Brought it in delhi ncr region. Got 2500 as cash back on road 62k -2500 cashback. It's been 2 weeks ridden around 125kms. So far, used for office commute, not ridden beyond 60. I love the retro chrome head style years that's the only reason i brought the bike and for my family needs being a father of two. Pros you can keep full helmet+one mini helmet, cons it should be full metal body.",Suzuki
"1.Buying is raid to something conferrable raid2.City raid and out of station perfect mileage and no back pain smooth riding3.So good and royalty look,comfort feel4.Not bad,good 5. So these are it's advantages and disadvantages ,which consider carefully so that you can make a sensible decision. Thanks by suzuki",Suzuki
Beautiful design by suzuki. Good build quality. More comfortable riding with good handling. More mileage than other 125cc scooty. Acceleration is very good and very smoothly. I think this scooter is suitable for any age person and superb and riding quality. So go for it because suzuki have changed its look and style ,Suzuki
The engine is much powerful enough and have the sweet look its beneficial for office work it also packs a heavy baggage space under the seat i suggest you to buy this scooty which is the best 60k it's comfort is unbelievable i can drive 60km on a single ride without any strain one more thing that it's usb port helps me to charge my smartphone on my trips.,Suzuki
I bought access 125 on 18 Oct 17. I gone through the comparison of all the other competitors like activa and jupiter but when i saw and took a test ride i realized something different with this bike. The height the pickup the suspension the average no starting trouble all these are the key points. This is really a fun ride and awesome bike with nearly 45 to 50kmpl of average.,Suzuki
1. I am very exited when i buy this scooter. Buying experience is amazing.2. This scooter ride quality is superb and outstanding. Engine is very smooth and refined. Easy to handle.3. Look is actually pretty good. And the headlamp design is awesome. The headlamp design is main highlight of this scooter.And the scooter looks is so big in this segment.4. This scooter service maintenance coast is too less compare to any other in this segment.  5. Finally i am going to pros and cons segment. What i actually like and what is bad about this scooter.    cons    1. I think this scooter is too light according to 125cc engine. Because engine power is comparatively high and scooter is too light in weight.    2. I don't like the build quality of this scooter. Because scooter made up of 80 percent fiber and 20 percent metal. Personally i don't like this.    pros    1. Superb handling    2. Powerful and big bulky look    3. Design is pretty awesome   4. Power and pickup is really good    5. Breaking quality is good   6. Internal storage of this bike really big.   7. Suspension is respectively good.,Suzuki
"Its highly reliable , smooth to handle , with standard looks, glides like water, time saving and fuel efficient.The driving experience is just fabulous. It became my personal favorite in the first drive itself. I can assure anyone who buys this that you wont be disappointed. Its worth the money guys.",Suzuki
"Suzuki access 125 is a great deal for a daily commuter. Great for traffic, seat at a comfortable position, good pickup and at a great price. Variety of colour schemes available. Body is made of fibre which makes it lighter (not heavy as activa). Its 125cc engine gives good response on highway as well as traffic. Under its seat not much space to keep a helmet but can hold groceries.Servicing not much required. I have owned one for more than a year and yet serviced only twice. It has a long seat which offer good comfort for long rides. Access being 125cc has satisfying fuel economy of about 50-55 kmpl. Headlight and brake-light are very low and can be made bright. But overall performance is great and no problems except that of fuel economy.",Suzuki
"Buying access 125 is a pleased...It's the only scooter which has more pickup,mileage,speed, reliable and trustworthy,comfort... But only one thing i didn't like that was...The previous model access 125 was superb in look wise..Good service centers,staff's were good..Neatly explained about the vehicle..Totally buying this access 125 was an awesome experience",Suzuki
1. The salesmen are too good explaining patiently about the vehicle and on time they had delivered.2.Its the best scooters of all time i feel.With it's best pickup and and max speed of 100.3.Looks are ok compared to honda dio and performance is. It gives its best while in traffic pickup. 4.Best,Suzuki
"This access nice mileage, pickup super look,  low maintenance, long drive, super service center in tamilnadu all spares are available in service center, phone charger,  also convenient to use in traffic, students also use comfortably, i think best suggest in access have in different color variant thank you.",Suzuki
Initial it was ok for an year but after one year it started lagging too many times it automatically get stop in between the ride. I serviced for more than 10 15 times back to back and spend more than 12k still this scooter is not working fine. Each and every part is very expensive. My recommendation not go for access 125 better go for honda.,Suzuki
The buying experience was very good very friendly staff the riding experience was excellent and very speed engine look was very good!! i had a blue colour scooty with smooth finishing was very bright and the front light was very good due to it the bike look is very good maintenance was also easy. But sometimes the engine stops when the bike slows down so it is only the defect in this product.,Suzuki
"Fly like a bird,start like a sprinter,relax like a child.Suzuki access is fit during heavy traffic or long distance travel.We can feel the engine power while the signal light become green we will be in the front row.It is best suited for metros where heavy traffic is always expected.Proud to be an owner of suzuki access.",Suzuki
1.According to me it was love at first sight 2.This thing is very cool to ride and and speed up like woosh. 3.Looks and performance is very standard and it gives an awesome balance while riding 4.Very good maintenance and very cool mileage. In love with this thing.. ! definitely if you try this you will love it too..!!,Suzuki
"Suzuki access is very good vehicle. We already have a tvs vehicle, we drive suzuki access at messoorie. Then we compare tvs and suzuki access, pick up of suzuki access is very good, space of suzuki access is very good, seat is so comfortable, no voice. Pick up and seat is important for drive. Important average is good.",Suzuki
"Buying experience good..Riding is nice n smooth..Looks and performance is good..Service and maintenance is easy..Pros and cons are favourable..Suzuki access 125 is really good ..When i took a ride i really made decision to own this because of it's smooth ride...and i loved to buy, other features besides ride is also good like..It's space in front and in dicky..Overall suzuki access 125 is really good...",Suzuki

Contact them to know the showroom, ex- showroom price and other queries.Great experience with services centre Good resales value.",Suzuki
"Not going into the deeper or more comprehensive types of reviews, I bought this scooter for the sole reason of it's pick up and power, and speaking honestly, it doesn't disappoint. The throttle response gets slow as the amount of fuel in your tank decreases. The ride quality is appalling at full pressure of the tyres (which is 22/29 psi front/back). On a bumpy road, your back will give out due to it's poor ride quality but on a smooth and open road, you won't be able to resist smiling as your the gust of wind hits you as you cross 75kmph pretty easily. I have topped it at 89kmph almost effortlessly. The mileage it gives me hovers around 45kmpl to 50kmpl and I easily rack up to 40 kilometers per day. An advantage of having the disc brake version is the peace of mind it offers, having a disc brake gives good control to the rider and is pretty high up on safety, after all, these are Indian roads. I don't have any other complaints about the vehicle, it is astonishingly strong on the basis of engine performance and sturdiness. Though, heavier than Activa 5G, it doesn't really lose any pick up. The storage is quite impressive, as it stores a lot of stuff I carry around, ranging from winter jackets to helmets and books, there's always room for more. About the servicing, Suzuki gives the standard four free services and then paid services. I've had three free services done, and all of them were well executed and finished and you can notice the change in engine performance after the service. For maintenance, I usually wash it with a water hose every Sunday, using gentle car surface soap and microfibre cloths to keep it clean and shining. Engine maintenance doesn't require much, just regular engine oil replacement. The disadvantage is the ride quality at high pressure, but there is a workaround for that too, just reduce the tyre pressure a little and you should be riding much better.",Suzuki
I bought it on 16 aug 2017. I drove it 2500 kms. I am getting mileage of 45 in riding economy speed. Easy to ride.Maintenance cost is low till now.I have never faced a problem till now.I have normal drum model with white colour. Braking capacity is awesome in drum model also. Brakes are too soft. I prefer you to buy it.,Suzuki
"I love to ride this bike,  beautiful pickup, extra space,  mobile charger,  average is good,  maintenance is less than comparing to other one, stand for water bottle, good in traffic, no tension of changing gear,  easy to sit for two and one child, smooth riding, disc brake is good, indicated to re-fuel.",Suzuki
This scooty is fast and have really amazing acceleration compare to other scooty like activa. It's powerful and withstand heavy load. But the cons is here is that the front body part it full fibre no metal but in activa they give front metal front body even in newer model. It can even also withstand high speed but be careful about brake they are not powerful like the engine.,Suzuki
"I bought Suzuki access 125 after comparing it with Jupiter, n-torque, Aprilia 150 and Cygnus x-ray. I was very confused between access and Cygnus x-ray but finally gave in for access for two reasons, superb braking system and it's a good family scooter (which is the main reason for purchase). Riding access is pure pleasure because of the great suspension it provides and the 125cc helps run it at a good 60+ speed very comfortably.  On highways it even touches 80kmph and still stays very much in control. The turns are perfect and maneuvering is very easy. About it's looks, obviously Cygnus and N-torq look insanely superb compared to access and if you are for looks then this scooter is not for you, but again it's not meant to be the super sexy scooter. With good mileage and a bigger seat, you love the drive on access 125. The better suspension gives you good control in potholes and there is enough space for a kid to stand at the front when you ride it with kid.I recently got it serviced and there was a waiting of 3/4 hours for basic oil change but again, i went there on weekend so nothing much to complain. It's too early to talk about the maintenance as it's just over 2 months that i have used it but it is giving me good 40kmpl mileage.Pros:- family scooter- good suspension- very reliable and comfortable at high speeds- big boot for helmet. Cons:- looks are not to attract the younger crowd- missing thinks like digital watch (even Tvs Wego has it), and latest features like bluetooth- the company steel guard is horrible as it comes right on top of kicker and you might hurt your leg while kick-starting the scooter- pillion rider seat is little down as compared to other scooters.",Suzuki
"this bike cost must be below 60000 i think maybe ok otherwise 55000 then the customers will take it easily about money. The suzuki access 125 is our flagship scooter which combines the i best of both worlds - power & mileage - with our technology and Personally, i like pearl deep blue color in suzuki access 125 master of technology suzuki motorcycle india private limited (smipl),  ! variant of their flagship then along with the cbs upgrade, the access 125 special and receives a new colour",Suzuki
Its very simple to buy. When you ride the bike it make you feel proud by its smooth riding.Look wise it gives you mescaline pride. Service provider are good and they give extra care to your bike. It is zero maintenance bike. Its suspension is quite good. Even it takes very few seconds to reach 0-60 km/h.,Suzuki
I ride it for more than 1 month it was amazing to ride with it. It's steady and not very heavy. It can be easily driven safe. It was pleasure to ride with suzuki access 125. Speed is good. It's very much smooth in riding and seat also very comfortable. The activa which i ride was my masa's and now i am keen to buy it.,Suzuki
I had bought it from siddhi suzuki from solapur and the people are too good and nice hospitality at the showroom and my riding experience is awesome and very powerful and look wise the best scooter and performance is just mind blowing and its service are 4 free and it's like no maintenance Little heighted vehicle and very good in mileage Cons are like nothing.,Suzuki
"1.Buying experience was good except paperwork all was good paper work took lot of time 2.It was very good .Throttle was crisp good pickup ,but after riding it for couple of hours i was feeling pain in my bum but not a big problem .I'll say overall riding experience was not the best but was good enough for my daily usages.3.Performance is all good but after 2 month delivery the response form the throttle was less .I was getting milage of 50 till first service now i am getting 55+i think.No issue upto this period of time except throttle and a little bit less response from breaks.4.Service experience was also good after every service it was feeling like the engine is more refined .And maintenance cost is around 1700 to 2000 i'm not sure about it my dad takes it for servicing .But i am pretty sure it's all going to be good with this scooty it's a good product .5.Pros-1 good mileage 2 performance   cons-well i've not faced any major issue till date.",Suzuki
I have buyed this scooty since june 2016. It is very comfortable. The looks of this scooty is awesome. The features too are awesome. The mileage too is very good. The seat is very spacious and comfortable. Since the day i have buyed the scooty till the date the maintenance cost is only of service. I have a very good experience of this scooty and thinking of taking one more suzuki access 125 for my brother.,Suzuki
"Access is good for daily use. You can even use it for long drives like 200-300 km. The performance is good, compared to others. Looks are also nice. Maintenance is quite low. And suzuki has its own servicing centre, so there is no worries.The pros are give good mileage, looks okay,  and we can get spare parts in cheap everywhere.Cons: It makes sound after 6-7 years of use.Looks dull after 4-5 years.",Suzuki
"The scooter is pretty cool and classy in look. The suspension is great which gives very smooth riding. The chrome makes it more classy. The handle control is better than any other scooter in this segment. Little disappointed with the mileage, company is claiming up to 66kmpl, but even if i try minimum usage of breaks, and correct usage accelerator it gives only 40kmpl. Overall the vehicle is superb in performance.",Suzuki
"What a perfect bike for daily users up to 40 km/day. Its over professional look. Good average, pickup, fuel consumption , comfort,  all about good. And when i got this access 125 i have satisfaction to ride two wheeler my friends always telling me to purchase this but i never mind it to tell them,  but one day finally my choice going to Suzuki access. Thank you",Suzuki
It's amazing for everything uses. It's best of all scooters. It's looks very smart then any other scooters.It is also best for tour riding and  get the best dream ride with partner. It is very fluently going through the road and also easy smooth acceleration. I think it is the best of all scooters to the riding.,Suzuki
"1. Buying experience:My nearest dealer was very much friendly and offered me good deal. Purchased in Sept, 2017.2. Riding experience:Ride quality is very good. Floor is long to give space for adjusting legs in long rides. Used for daily commute and some long rides between my workplace and home. Ride is comfortable. Scooter very stable in high speed. City handling is good too.3. Details about looks, performance etc.Looks is subjective but  i found this retro style look good. Nothing to tell about this suzuki 125cc engine. Super smooth. Heating is minimal unless in a traffic for long time. I use motul semi-synthetic oil for more smoothed performance as my riding is bit heavy.4. Servicing and maintenance:Maintenance cost is very less. Nothing much has to be done in regular services. No oil filter in the scooter hence no need for oil filter replacement. 5.Pros A.

"Suzuki bikes are very  nice , practical and cost effective, but the designs need little bit more varieties with modern designs for youth with a workable prices with a good mileage. The effective design should be more economic in consuming oil and price ( mileage >70km/l) price I will think for buying a new suzuki bike if i find good price with design.",Suzuki
"Buying experience : i got this bike at a down payment of 30k with 24 months of emi of rs 2998 it's costing around 2,02,000 but it's negotiate with different dealer i am satisfied with the pricing. Riding experience : suzuki access 125 is the best when comes to riding instant self start butter smooth riding experience and urgent disk brakes makes it go out of the box. Details about looks, performance : look-wise it's very gorgeous you can't take your eyes off with seeing this beautiful plenty a times suzuki has designed this scooter inspiring from old model scooter of early 1900 hence it's also tagged with the title old is gold. Servicing and maintenance : if you maintain your fuel tank with  petrol at least one litre you will get an average of 45-50 kmpl which is amazing ?? and you will rarely do services.",Suzuki
"Simply, Positive awards.. Good looking, mileage 40 to 55 km/l, mechanism still good surely change oil after 1500 to 2000km for long life, comfortable to repair (cheap spares parts). Negative awards.. Tyres size, fibre neck, not combo brakes still good with other features. Depend on riders how to use Suggested.. Not for rash driving still pickup & bhp is too good Overall suzuki is giant in automobile industry we can t judge vs compression with honda or others. Thanks & enjoy.",Suzuki
Buying experience was good had great time with suzuki they were on peak with their service Riding experience : in terms of ride quality it is good compared to others soaks up bumps with ease. Looks are awesome performance is good for city use Good after sale service low maintenance Only pros and  few cons.,Suzuki
"1.Buying experience brought it for around 65k o jan 1st,2017 from authorised dealer.I was very happy while purchasing it and getting it delivered after 30 mins like a pizza.I was using another vehicle at the same time i brought this beauty home.2.Riding experience riding it is always a fun no matter how the road is.I have travelled a lot around the city with access 125.The pickup,acceleration,suspension meet at its fullest.The suzuki sep engine is beast !3.Looks,performance if you have seen access 125 on road,you wont ask about its look.Its probably the best looking bike out there.4.Servicing and maintenance rode it for more than a year now but never paid for anything extra which was not covered in warranty.Service centre was very active in their job.5.Pros*look*mileage*service***cost 6.Cons i would love to see it’s sporty look.No offence,if you want to keep it premium and classic.",Suzuki
"Suzuki access 125 bike very comfort with driving & excellent  pickup.More ever seat comfort is very good. Mileage also very good, low maintenance. Overall i am very  happy with this bike. Compare to other brands in this segment  access 125 looking very stylish  and weight is also very low, colours also very good.",Suzuki
"Do not own this scooter, but a true die hard fan of this new version. Its having all the features which other scooter don't. Its a perfect example for style, passion and attitude. Its a powerhouse for speed and mileage. Never miss to buy this if opportunity permits. Be admired by others while driving. A eye catching sparkling effect on road. P. Raghunath",Suzuki
"I need to buy a 125cc scooter. I visited suzuki showroom and found this scooter fit for my needs. I am planning to buy this by the end of march '19. All the colours are attractive, but i liked to buy light colour like white, light grey, steel grey. Black colour is also looking nice. But i like glossy black which is not there.",Suzuki
"Access 125 is awesome bike. Mileage is also very good.Space is very more compare to other.,.. I would like to suggest you prefer this bike.Access 125 is awesome bike. Mileage is also very good.Space is very more compare to other.,.. I would like to suggest you prefer this bike.Access 125 is awesome bike. Mileage is also very good.Space is very more compare to other.,.. I would like to suggest you prefer this bike.",Suzuki
"Before buying i seen many good comments but after buying i realised , Mileage will be 40 to 45 based on routes .Buy this in any showroom except tc pally bengaluru aryan suzuki showroom , i had worst buying experience. Paid money and he delayed to give vehicle and accessories. It's like got vehicle one day and some delay he give foot-mate and some days charger ex ..Still i didn't received rc book ..",Suzuki
Very good rides in cities. Easily accessible in traffic. Good average. Very comfortable.Even too good for long drives low maintenance . Only drawback its speedometer and odometer it gets spoil if anyone take the button of the cover of it and water enters through it.Other wise too good scooter given competition to bike in long rides.Good mileage and pick up make  it better.,Suzuki
"I have purchased last month suzuki access and there is a continue problems comes one by one but whenever i go for service they never gives positive reply by the service manager, come tomorrow 8 am in morning or there is no mechanic in work shop, no one responsible in showroom and workshop i never suggest to anyone for access.",Suzuki
Buying experience is overall good. Suzuki gave a studd helmet . Access 125 is a very light weight scooter and smooth. Rectangular shaped headlight is little bit retro. It has at about 22 litre inner storage and 12 inch front wheel and long seat compared to the many scooter.  Another good thing is it has front pocket  where anyone can easily keep a mobile phone or a small water bottle. Only disadvantage of this vehicle that i feel till now in my 700-800 km ride that it does not have the external fuel filling system. Everytime you have to open the seat in the time of refilling. But that is not a big issue. It has two clip to tie the bag or something and good space for resting you legs while riding. It's speedometer is analogue but trip-meter s are digital and halogen typed headlamp.,Suzuki
"At the outset, thanks to suzuki brand to introduce such a great bike to the nation.And, the riding is amazing on hindustan streets and highways. It's looking quite. If change oil for every 3000 km, it will with us long time. It is shootable to all i.E. Official and commercial uses. Access zim zim...",Suzuki
"Riding the Access 125 is much easier due to it's light weight and peppy engine. Looks are perfect and a balance between retro and modern. It's not heavy on your pocket for service avg cost of service is quite less. Pros: Slick handling and light weight (2) Powerful engine (3) Comfortable seating and suspension setup (4) Best mileage even after driving rough, give around 52kmplCons: (1) External fuel filling (2) Rear Tyre should have been a 12 inch one (3) Instrument cluster is classy but basic.Do go for it if you want a comfortable 125cc scooter with mileage.",Suzuki
"Best scooter in its range, better than many other costlier options, sitting position and riding position are very good, smooth handling and performance. Larger tyres for better grip, brakes are good, overall best option for daily commuters, previously i was not a access fan, so was always interested in honda dio or tvs entorq but due to unavailability of my choice colour i opted for suzuki access 125 and it seemed the right choice, this scooter gives me the feeling of a bike, i was always a bike lover, having a 200 cc 2009 avenger and never liked scooters, but with technical changes and upgrading engineering have changed my view on scooters. Would suggest my friends also to go for suzuki access.",Suzuki
"I get an mileage better than any other scooter type. Company assured 64 km/pl but it's better to get above 50 km/pl than any other scooter type. If proper maintenance is done this is the best scooter model for personal daily use. Look of the vehicle is extremely awesome than other scooter model, i love matte grey colour it's very unique.",Suzuki
I bought this scooter few weeks back and i must say that it is a beast in the 125cc segment. It is light weight and very comfortable to ride for a taller rider like me. I never tested the mileage but i refuel it for rs 250 (almost 3.5 ltrs) and it runs for an entire week.I bought a drum brake variant and it does a decent job. The front pocket option is very handy where we can keep mobile or small stuffs during ride. The seat is quite big and rider and pillion can sit very comfortably. The engine is also quite smooth and pickup is great. If you go by my opinion i would suggest anyone looking for an all round scooter can go for it.,Suzuki
"Buying experience was not that good as i bought it on credit card so had to pay more cause the price of it was on a higher side compared to the other scooties in the market.While you ride the scooty first thing which you will feel is the power and the acceleration is great. Secondly pickup is great. If you see the scooty and you ride it you will feel it is a bit taller than other scooters like activa etc.Also the sound which it produces while riding is more as compared to others.It looks decent something like vespa, performance is good.You have to pay attention to the engine and servicing is very required.Pros: good pickup, acceleration, looks and under spacious. Cons: low kmpl, maintenance and engine sound.",Suzuki
Best moped for daily use. In just 12 months my access 125 running is 15000 kms. I use my scooty for my college my daily running for scooty is 80-90 kms still its just maintenance free as compared to other mopeds like tvs jupiter and ntorq. In terms of looks i would say best moped in market.  I service my moped in every 4000 kms . Servicing is also very low cost.,Suzuki
I bought it for 80000 rupees from west bengal. The buying process is very smooth and secure.The riding is very smooth and troubleless. Because its suspension are really very good.I think that its look is not enough. I will be more glad if i have a sporty look of it.Service and maintenance are quite enough.,Suzuki
"Simple, amazing bike, best bike for ordinary people too. Budget wala bike. I just loved it. The structure, design everything is superb. Best bike for this year. Riding experience is superb. Disc brakes everything had gave me amazing experience. So comfortable during riding. I used to ride daily. I loved it alot. As it was owned by my father. With my salary i will buy my first bike in my life with emi.",Suzuki
"Suzuki access 125 is better option than activa as everything is superior than activa ..Mileage is good boot space is good robust build quality digital meter . I am happy with my decision. Pros and cons. Pros1) excellent pickup = v.Good for traffic roads, you can go without any hustle.2) good control & smooth ride.3) large storage capacity. (when ever go for shopping , will dump as much in under seat & basket)Cons 1) somewhat weight, ladies may feel tough to put center stand & also to lift the vehicle when needed (lifting in rear)2) those who are less height may feel discomfort in driving or pillion seat (for longer distance)Thank you hope i will win this contest.",Suzuki
Suzuki access 125 can had buy both poor and rich people because it has suitable price for both. when i ride  first time suzuki access 125  i fall in love with access 125 because its power of riding is more better than other scooty    its braking system is too smooth ..It has very less maintenance its service charges is very low under 1000 only i don't have an words to describe these features ......,Suzuki
"First ill write pros as they are very less 1) good n powerful engine2) good pick up and mileage3) good body styling 4) large boot space: Cons1) headlight doom has manufacturing defect and you'll hear a shaking sound always. The clip system is bad n breaks2) front fork is a failure, due to manage battery space fork has been shifted a bit and keeps getting lose often, constant maintenance is required. 3) disk brake. Although a boon, but suzuki might have opted for a new player to provide disk brakes and hence it doesn't work effectively especially with combi brake system4) there is a huge problem in engine and clutch. You can hear a constant brushing of something every time u give accelerator. Surprisingly i haven't heard this from anyone who wrote the review. I tested and used access 125, new show room access and my vehicle, all have this sound. It starts to vibrate high at low speeds. Even the reviewers like bikewale n all didn't write about it5) battery. There is a starting or starter problem with  new access 125, and when i went to see bike first, 3 people in front of me complaint of this issue. Even my friend bought n sold immediately because of starting issue and company says its due to battery. They provide exide battery which has good reputation. Exide has changed battery size and made it smaller. Not sitting its because of this or there is some issue with sep engine of suzuki 6) seat lock. My earlier model access used to lock the seat so smoothly, but the new lock needs a little extra pressure to lock7) torque pit sound. You can hear the vibration of torque pits even when engine is new. This is something that was there is earlier models too8) entire body except the front mudguard is made of plastic. This something that breaks first when u have a fall, can't be fixed or is costly unlike metal shields, and when u claim insurance u don't100% claim to plastic items. To save cost n reduced weight they have made bike of plastic 9) the company says it will not cover warranty if service not done in suzuki centers n all service coupon used. I had read a judgment from court of law that companies can't do this and had fined big time. Has this law changed? as i don't trust company service centres especially two wheeler ones. What could be improved. 1) reduce dial size and increase digital meter size2) add clock to show time3) front headlight flash switch 4) led parking lights and indicator lights. 5) map n gps navigation.",Suzuki
"It's very good in city riding.It looks great & performance is best in 125 segment.General cost in serving, not much, simply change the oil and cleaning up carburetor and air filter, moped would be ride as new after serving. Milage is 40-45.Really it pays me good experience at all.Moped can be used for long ride also.",Suzuki
"Best riding experience, good comfort , low maintenance cost ,superior pickup . Looks are pretty and comfortable and long seat.External fuel fill is required . That is what is the need of hour . Some more paint colours are expected .Suspension is telescopic in from that gives smooth & comfortable ride.Overall a nice scooter of suzuki.",Suzuki
Ya great but services is poor but ride is good for get fast reach and also safe but meanwhile  what is different  for old and new scooty  motor bike fast fact to work place is no normal like some time sport bike my asked how we also go fast ride see how much mileage  give up and many say activa is better than this suzuki 125 what i think to do now.,Suzuki
"Let's consider ""her"" If you treat her like princess on the road at 40 to 50 kmph on your speedo. She gives 50 to 55 kmpl without a fuss. If you treat her like bitch on the road at 65 to 80 kmph on your speedo. She gives up 35 to 40 kmpl squealing.But, below are my observation with her from march 2019 that's when i gifted her myself. She is very reliable on the road She can be maintained at low cost She has good built yet lot of plastics around. Only your front wheel doom is steel. She plunges like a tiger in the traffic. She is stable on the road. She looks gorgeous. She has big boot space. She has good suspension She beats her competition in terms of torque and power. She puts ""squid activa"" to lol on the road. She has cbs breaks which keeps you so safeHer headlights are really not good.She has to be bathed at least once in a week to keep her pretty.",Suzuki
"I am riding suzuki access from last one year, am enjoying all the riding experience with suzukis world class features, regarding servicing ii feel little sad, tank capacity can be increased, you can only fill around 300 rs petrol in one go, as of now there is no complain, hope it will help others to choose wisely.",Suzuki
"Found satisfied with driving a suzuki access 125 , and it's matte black colour is look like a terrific view with compare other vehicles that had analog and digital measurements are attached simply because it safe and sound good and also share mileage so good and the access 125 is compatible for all adult, senior setition and woman's are also safe drive..",Suzuki
Buying experience was ok they had explain we all features properly. I have glad to ride this bike. Black matte colour looking amazing colour. Service agency was cheating with us they was not changing any kind of material. Made a bill various type of material. And otherwise i have happy to buy access 125.,Suzuki
"Service and maintenance is high of cost... Disc brake is somewhat okay compared to drum brakes... Drum brake seems not to work properly... Its good for long travel... Mileage is also set to be okie...Good scooter with disc brake useful for men and drum brake will be helpful for women... The more we drive safe , the bike is in good condition...",Suzuki
"We bought suzuki access 125 over activa 5g or activa 125  last year because It's 125cc. It's lighter in weight so i can handle it easily better than activa 125.Looks very stylish.Leg room is more so i can place bags with my child standing in front and feel comfortable.Longer seats so when the whole family rides together we are comfortably seated without cramping like in activa 5g. The front pocket is very useful for holding bottles for kids, small purse, mobiles, any small thing which we need it to be handy at any time.Better suspension for bumpy roads ( during rainy season our roads become so bumpy and watery ,but with access it is very easy to maneuver through the road).Servicing is good in our area.",Suzuki
"Well balanced between power, performance, mileage and comfort. Go for it. You will be happy. But keep in mind that for the pillion rider, the footrest is placed slightly above, which may feel uncomfortable for some. But the suspension system is very good. Overall it is very fine. You will not regret. My mileage(around 53-54) is clearly in town riding with very bad roads.",Suzuki
"Buying experience is not much great, riding the bike gives u better confidence at u can carry more luggage and every refined very very smooth, the look of front side the chrome design is well done loved it, service 1st cost above 5 hundreds something they will tell u we will fix the things what I told them, pros:1 better seats 2:best leg room upto 6 inch. Cons:1:mileage is not much above 40-42, 2:suspension will not work if ur riding single if above 100 kg it works, 3:the vehicle get vibration while in traffic.",Suzuki
Suzuki access 125 very comfortable moped compare to all moped in india Full paisa vasool. My daily ride 120km in city and outer area but ride was awesome and comfortable Service team very good all team best in suzuki. All my friends i recommend don't buy other company moped suzuki access is one of the best moped this time.,Suzuki
"Yes, i always happy and satisfied to buy suzuki access 125. Its easy to drive and ride very smoothly with more secure. Take lots of load on front and as well as under seat storage, looking very nice and loving beautiful colors, servicing and maintenance get call from service centre, its giving free service with fabulous offers.",Suzuki
Its very amazing bike and i was feeling comfortable when using it. It is very useful for our family also. In difficult times it will be very useful to all of us. We have been using it since 6 years and it is very good and i like it a lot i just really wanna buy it again further next model. Thank you.,Suzuki
Awesome look and performance best in its class. Very good as compared to other in the same segment really gives a very good feeling while riding. Height looks more than the normal scooters and the colour variant in limited edition is really wow and suzuki has tried to give a elegant look and the company has done it to the great extent.,Suzuki
I am using this for daily basis for going to college which is 5 km away from my place and i like this scooty very much but it gives mileage of only 40 km per litre.Buy only if you can manage its service cost and high maintenance Its service cost is approximately double than other economic scooters like tvs jupiter and honda activa ......Pros:1.Powerful engine 2.Looks good 3.Comfortable. Cons:1.High maintenance 2.Less mileage 3.Costly parts.,Suzuki
I feel that riding experience was good but the service and engine was not good. Also parts are not available of it. Looking is awesome and attractive. Also colours are available as per our choice. Buying experience was also good. But after buying this vehicle i feel cheated by the company. Because I am  completely dissatisfied with company.,Suzuki
It's a good scooty for family used and mileage is also good. When it comes to took moped for all users i test ride jupiter but found low pick up and looks wise not good then went to honda showroom their i found activas build quality is not the same as before and boot space is so small that no one can utilise it for big things after than went to suzuki showroom thier i found all features like high pik up high average and sales staff was co operative and gave me test ride after getting test ride i booked on the same and now the proud of owner suzuki access 125 its really a premium vehicle.,Suzuki
Rate is fine not so high  like honda bikes  suzuki access is better than honda activa  and yamaha ray cygnus and tvs jupiter or wego. Awesome to ride very comfortable than other scooters. Look is gentle. Service is awesome. Shockers are so comfortable Vehicle is not jerking in speed breakers as all other scooters. Tyre are big 90.90.12 tubeless tyres with alloy wheel.,Suzuki
It was a good experience in buying suzuki access 125.The mileage was good .The on road experience was fantastic. The seat space was very comfortable. The look was quite different . It was the unique experience. The braking system was good. It was tubeless tyres. The riding experience was too good. The access maintenance was fantastic The cons are The mileage was not up to the mark.,Suzuki
"Suzuki access scooter is dashing looking very light ,smooth and beautiful. It's kpl and speed pick up is fantastic totally fantastic i really love this scooty.It is far better than activa and honda. Access is very light from activa honda.It's servicing and maintenance is so easy and wondering.I have never seen this type of scooter before. Everybody can ride and drive so easily and it's cost is not so high it is available in reasonable price.",Suzuki
"many youths  in city  thinking to buy Scooter , but in terms of look they became little bit disappointed or shy . it is  too expensive to buy Aprilia SR125 or Vespa. But Suzuki Did it with its stylish looks and well finished powerful machine ACCESS 125 . It's build quality is very good compare to ACTIVA ,Dio , Grazia.",Suzuki
"It good bike only milage is around 35 - 40 so good for a scooter type comfortable to seat and pick up, etc all is good better then activa & jupiter. Over all the performance of the bike is good and not a loss of money.  The suspension is average and nothing great. Technology is good and engine is smooth.",Suzuki
"It's a good scooter you should have own like this scooter very much.... I like this because it's a great scooter ...I have bought for my home purpose.. My family,s like this very much in grey color... You should take test drive. I am using this in kanpur it's good for our kanpur road ...Thanks you so much.",Suzuki
Good bike daily commuters as i was using this bike for more than one year. It will get a mileage of about 35-40 kmpl. Very good for long journeys and for people who travel about 20-25 km daily like me. Looks also good in the newer version compared to old one. The only negative point is the engine sound and self start problem frequently.,Suzuki
I owned my access 125 se on cheque payment from authorised distributor rock suzuki byculla.The riding experience is great and relaxed.In terms of looks and performance it has a retro look and superior performance as it has a 124 cc engine which is a great in today automatic scooter segment.The sitting is posture is very relaxing due to its 12 inch tyre in front which is a pros and cons is suzuki is claiming the average of 64kmpl is only on the testing track but the actual average is 40-45kmpl in the city streets.,Suzuki
"Access 125 click among the masses is the fact that it had a higher displacement 125cc motor as opposed to the 110cc unit on its rivals. Other positives were  refinement, reliability and ease of maintenance being a product from the land of the rising sun.The suzuki access maintained its position as among the highest selling 125cc scooter in india but has faced stiff competition since the honda activa 125 made its debut which is also our pick as the best 125cc scooter on sale in india. The suzuki access was showing its age cosmetically and mechanically while new products also sported better features. Taking note of this situation, the japanese two-wheeler giant recently launched the new suzuki access 125.The new suzuki access 125 gets a semi-digital unit with a digital display for fuel gauge, odometer, service indicator and two trip meters. The seat can be unlocked conveniently through the ignition keyhole which is a good addition. Also the shutter key has a one push central lock system. There’s also a cubby hole next to the choke knob which is deep enough to hold a 1-litre water bottle. Mobile charger is an optional extra and is located next to the cubby hole unlike the under seat option as in rival scooters.",Suzuki
"This is our second bike, it's built quality is great. The speed to stability is great on-road driving. Fuel efficient even on triple ride. Must have bike for all purpose strongly build for indian road. No others bike has compare to it. The blue color is eye catching. The service center people are very cordial and helpful. This is a must have bike.",Suzuki
The scooty is very comfortable. Suspensions is superb at this range of price and look cool even youth can ride it with style !!! i use this scooty for everyday use and i like it very much to ride . Disc brakes is the good thing you can ride fast and save because of it and the acoustic is also somewhat good other than different scooty.,Suzuki
"I am happy to share my experience with you .I bought suzuki access 125 from a new showroom vaibhav suzuki  at rakesh marg,ghaziabad.I liked its performance..As they says”kum peeta hai”it actually does the same.Good mileage..Pickup...Everything is good .At the same time i can say i took the right decision to buy my scooty from vaibhav suzuki showroom at ghaziabad.",Suzuki
The overall scooter is kinda great.The build is steady and it has got a very nice look.There are just no problems if you keep it serviced.I own this for about 2 years now.. And haven't faced any particular issue with this.Even at high speeds of like 70-80 kmph the scooter is pretty well stable.Gives about a 35 kmpl in the hills and city ride.And everything is as expected as i currently live in shimla.Only one trade off are the small tyres.,Suzuki
"When i first bought access 125, is was this uplifting machine with so much power, the engine is very good and does not give any trouble if used properly. It is great for daily or occasional commute but not for any much longer terms as the seat could get uncomfortable at times. Even after years running it never gave any huge issues or needing regular maintenance. Service is not costly and is satisfiable. Try not to interfere with the scooter by adding any accessories without consent from the dealer or rto, as it could result in creating problems with the vehicle.Best thing is it would never gives you trouble and always fun to ride.",Suzuki
"One of the best scooties I've ever rode.Access 125 is a comfortable two-wheeler that can be easily rode even by beginners as well as daily drivers. Suzuki is the only scooter in that cost range which offers combi break, telescopic suspension , and the only scooter which is suitable for tall persons and the seat comfort ability is awesome and larger than activa yamaha and tvs so go for suzuki. suzuki access 125 has road grip compare to other scooter. Comfortable to ride. Good pick up.",Suzuki
In India suzuki is one of the most trusted bike i have been using this bike from last 2 yrs  and this bike has an awesome features like charger front headlights and other awesome features even this bike has awesome fuel consumption and it has more ever fuel capacity. This bike give an awesome mileage more than 80 or something mileage Even you can use this bike for commercial use bike can lift any weight One of the best bike i ever rides Thank you.,Suzuki
"Hi all i have done 20,500 km on my access 125 and would like to give a real feedback. About my driving, i ride my scooty in a very relaxed manner all the time. The first problem arrived after 3 month's of buying was a bent in handle t bar, i thought it's a normal thing it can happen anytime cause of our country's roads, next thing i got to know about was a weird noise coming from gear box i went to service center these guy's told me it's a manufacturing fault we will fix it and will not charge me anything i was like clueless, thinking myself am i made a mistake buying suzuki product although they are a japanese brand, things went smooth for some time and another problem arises engine oil leakage. My scooty engine oil level started dropping down this time. Again the service guy's were very normal saying that it's a normal thing,   these engines usually face these kind of problems now and then i am really very sad after the suzuki experience. Very bad product. My thoughts are very clear with suzuki now will never ever suggest someone to buy suzuki 2 wheeler i doubt about there bike's coz now a days they are manufacturing big bikes like hayabusa in India don't know what they will do to it. Please some one from suzuki japan do the cross check what is happening in India. Don't spoil your brand image. Suzuki is launching his new scooter burgman street with the same engine so people out there please make sure you invest your money wisely.I was a big time suzuki fan earlier but they really let me down.Note: all the services was done by authorized suzuki workshop.",Suzuki
"Suzuki access is the scooter for all purpose and its designed very good and beautiful...Performance side this scooter is superb ,good mileage with no maintenance....Overall experience is awesome superb good “solid hai boss “Riding experience is awesome  buying experience is also awesome and it’s looking killer.....Powerful headlamps with powerful battery.",Suzuki
Experiencing 125  is just amazing n it makes more experience n excitement while riding 125 ...Its colour maroon it's just amazing and it while riding with friends it gives n another great experience it gives more happiness and enjoyment all around it makes mind fresher and gives wonderful experience everyday and every morning i just love my 125.,Suzuki
Am using suzuki access 125 from about 1 year.  Scooter gives a best performance among the bikes for that rate.  Its performance is satisfying. Its very comfortable while riding suzuki access 125. I think it has best seating among the model of other scooties. It has nice looking. New model access is  superb than old versions. Its style out standing. And maintaining access 125 is simple.  All over its great having an suzuki access 125.,Suzuki
I bought second hand access 125 scooter for my daily commute. I had driven 3621km around this year. I had a good experience with this scooter. I love access 125 design. It's so pretty and smooth driving. Now my access 125 giving mileage around 45km/ ltr. I never had any starting problem or anything even though i bought it for second hand. I love this bike. Thank you suzuki.,Suzuki
Comfort like luxurious car... Smooth pickup like a cheese-slice...Stunning comfort & easy to control even for ladies...Riding on hill is as easy as bird fly upward...No noise for top speed too...Boot space and pocket holder so useful.... Sleek design  with combi braking...Precious ride with wide seat...,Suzuki
As i purchased suzuki access 125 this bike is powered with 125 cc which makes it  powerful in pickup and climbing to high. It never disappointed me .It's easy to handle and least maintenance required. I enjoy the riding on bike either in city or on long journey. The average i got is comparably good with other bike.,Suzuki
This is best scooter i have ever run one of most trusted scooter and also the company is also best this is the best scooter no other scooter can compare it with this scooter the mileage is also very good and the look is best never other scooter can compete with this scooter i taken it from my friend and go to college all my friends feel impressive about this scooter.,Suzuki
"Love to ride on suzuki access scooter type bike great pick mileage other than scooter...Look wise stylish comfortable to ride alone or double...One great experience was we were on trip and every one trying to rich first but i have access no one mass with it i putt all back, Every one just cheer for that...Thank you...",Suzuki
I bought this bike last year march-17 and from last three months vehicle is having serious tarting problem. I got it repaired 6 times but the same issue continues. Very embarrassed when the bike is stopped in the middle of the road when you are with family.  Not at all good experience with this vehicle.,Suzuki
I bought 3rd hand access 125 it's been around 2 years now the riding dynamics are still great but poor mileage. The body is still in good condition and gives a great and dashing look. Access 125 has great performance on road but provides very less mileage otherwise access 125 is great scooter which holds great dynamics in its different variants.,Suzuki
"Access has no vibration at high speed,looks are decent, classic headlamp, so many decent colour options, enough leg  space, mobile charger is additional feature, power is exceptional in the segment, for hilly areas access is a good option and mileage is quite better than others. Under seat fuel cap is the only lacking part.",Suzuki
"I would say that it is more comfortable to ride this in chennai traffic with hassle free.Happy to share my gratitude towards suzuki here.Everyone started loving your products even you have more competitors in this field.Keep rocking.One thing  i suggest the people who using bikes,please do care about your engine capabilities and oil maintenance.Thanks.",Suzuki
Very nice scooter in look as well as in mileage. It almost gives 55-57kmpl mileage. Which is far better then activa and some other scooters. The chrome finishing near head lamp gives decent look. Maintenance is less. Battery provided is maintenance less. Take your scooter for servicing time to time as mentioned. Overall weight distribution is good and scooter gives good stability while riding.,Suzuki
"Bike is amazing and stylish,  especially  good in comfortable  and low maintenance cost. Good fuel economy and reasonable spare parts cost as well as easy availability  of original parts in suzuki genuine. Bike can suit to any age group as any gender because its design is something special and unique.",Suzuki
"Its a fantastic bike for students, workers, employees also for everyone, its pick up was very good, better than other bikes like activa, jupiter, maestro, it gives supper mileage 55 to 60, it was a grate bike for long tours, its 125 engine was very strong and smooth, i like its engine beat sound, especially i like this brake condition, it have very good stooping when i press brake liver.",Suzuki
"Good scooter among its segment , i have bought suzuki access 125 drum model after a lot of research on the scooters . I have been using the scooter for around 3 months and driven around 1500+ kms now & i guess this time is sufficient to write a review  on the scooter . It has good pickup , doesn't shake while speed is above 70km/hr, good long & wide seat. Good amount of space underneath the seat . . Good mileage of  45+ km/liter  on hyderabad roads. On highways you can observe the mileage of about 55 km/liter.  The only concern is its digital console . The petrol meter always indicates false measure as a result we have to rush to the petrol bunk thinking that petrol is in reserve mode . Other wise its a very good family scooter . Really happy with the scooter .",Suzuki
It's really a good bike for daily city use and  it is good for occasional long rides. It gives good mileage in its segment and it has good power which h makes overtaking easier.It has a good style statement. It is comfortable and easy to handle. Braking and acceleration is pretty good. I have good memories with it. It has very good build quality.,Suzuki
"If once engine work done than after 2 month max scooty become again smoky..Rest of all it is the best bile/scooty in this segment but after sales service it is discriminate...It is one of its kinds special in any sense as mileage, pickup,speed , performance, but only If it become smoky than after engine work it works only months and again become same condition nevertheless Hero honda i used it 150000 km with only 3 times engine works...",Suzuki
"Good for an average people Shock absorber are good Causal look, good at mileage Satisfied Bad breaking system for an old model around dated= 2015, gain speed at a short time.The suzuki access 125 gets a completely new fascia thanks to the redesigned apron and rectangular headlamp. The side profile has also been revised thanks to reshaped curvy body panels, which now adorn a 3d emblem. The subtle touches of chrome on the headlamp and the exhaust shield give it a premium feel. The large silver-finished grab rail and the black plastic panels beautifully contrast with the scooter's glossy finish. The instrument cluster design is also new, and now integrates a digital multi information display. The large seat should make it a very comfortable scooter to ride, while relatively low seat height of 780mm makes it accessible even for short riders. It also gets a dc power socket, to plug in your cell phone charger that you well get at latest model.",Suzuki
"I bought it at very worthy price. I took for many rides such as mumbai to alibaug, mumbai to malshej ghat, and many more rides. Now talking about looks, it looks very decent and polite but don't judge it by looks it's performance is noteworthy no vibrations at all at any speeds. The servicing and maintenance is what suzuki lacks. Sometimes parts are not available even at proper showrooms, even the spares are seem to be overpriced as compared to honda.",Suzuki
Good.. I bought it at 69k for drum type model..The riding is comfortable and bike is spacious for all people in my family and look is great u can easily differentiate it from the public thanks to access design team and performance is also top notch. I have done servicing at showroom since it is very new and i have some free services left out and it also needs less maintenance overall worth buying.,Suzuki
This is best scooter in range of 125cc. I will use since 3 years and it will give good mileage and pickup. The condition is very good and strong. This have more feature than activa. Activa is very worst and poor scooter. Please don't go for activa .Activa will not give the mileage of 30kmpl so go on access.,Suzuki
"The first thing I have to tell that this is mini rocket and so practical, my buying experience was good showroom employees are also good. Access's ride is so smooth and comfy it is best scooter for long rides and it's performance is fantastic good pickup easy to overtake on highways and it's looks are so attractive, chrome treatment make it looks like a classic Italian scooter with best under seat storage. my service experience was good spare parts are available at every Suzuki service centre and please keep changing its stock air filter because the factory air filter in scooter's are never good you can put K N performance air filter forever and keep sending it for servicing.",Suzuki
This vehicle is very good.. Nice look..It's very comfortable for city ride.. Seating  comfort.....Good road grip.. Wide range of colours.......I'm using suzuki from past 15 years i really satisfied with this brand so  i purchased suzuki 125 access............Please maintain the same... If you reduce the spares price you can get more customers... .,Suzuki
"The suzuki access 125 is a great scooter. Buying experience was nice, the suzuki dealers were helpful and gave every detail of the access.The scooter runs very smooth and i enjoy riding it for everyday work and daily commute to the work place. The access 125 passes small road holes or disturbances without much jerk (less jerk) as felt in other site scooters. It's seat is also long and comfortable (i think it has one of the longest seat in scooters category). Leg space is normal like any scooter, has better ground clearance.The look of access is classic and feels nice. I own a matte grey colour .I think it's a good 125 cc scooter.",Suzuki
"It's elegant and light weight scooter. Gives great mileage. Not so great looks though maybe you need to alter it on your own for great looks, i always consider vespa looks are best in scooter category.Service is decent,  my paid service comes to 750/- and i hardly faced any issues with  suzuki access 125 scooter. Riding experience is smooth but i don;t like the engine sound.Registration they charge more at suzuki showrooms.Pros:-Smooth Light weight Elegant Great mileage Great riding control Cons:Looks Average service.",Suzuki
The people at the dealership were of a great help. They made it quick and easy for us. The vehicle was ready a day prior to pick up date. The vehicle has a excellent value for the price and is very torquey. You will definitely enjoy driving it. Its the seat that takes it a level above with the space it offers.,Suzuki
New access 125 is nightmare to own. Service is worst to my experience . Had visited 12 times in 20 months. They took 40 days to service 2 month old scooter once.  I never out of problem from the date of purchase.  Currently it has oil consumption problem. Every time dealer makeup something instead of replacing engine spares causing oil consumption. Warranty is a joke in suzuki.  I was not given bill for service done on warranty. I never ever go for suzuki again.,Suzuki
Bought it from the suzuki enterprise near my home. Yesterday much awaited colour combination matte black special edition with maroon seat covers loved it to the core. Its so smooth and the seating position the weight of the vehicle is also accurate. Wheel base is good and have all new combi brake with front disc and rear drum type brakes.,Suzuki
"Awesome bike is this, very good driving experience ,good mileage, maintenance easy to buy accessories all things are body of bike  all things are deserving 5 star. Me and my few friends are using same model.And till date bike is giving very good performance. So, i will recommend to all buys this bike.",Suzuki
"I think this scooter is value for money. I have been using it for a year. It's engine is working formally. This millage is about 52-55km. It's looking very gorgeous as yamaha fascino. Now let’s come to the engine. This 125cc engine is from the predecessor but suzuki has made some major changes and the result is evident. The motor is now equipped with suzuki eco performance (sep) technology, something we also see in the lets and gixxer. This has made the access 125 more efficient and refined and it’s quite apparent. In fact, this scooter is the most refined in the segment. And not just that, there’s no vibrations at all, even at high speeds, which is super impressive. The performance too, with 8.5bhp and 10.2nm at your disposal, the access 125 performs really well. If you’re in the market for a 125cc scooter, you’ve two more options – the honda activa 125 which is two years old and is the most expensive in the present range or the mahindra gusto 125, which behaves like an 110cc scooter, plus, it hasn’t been launched in most of the indian states. But we won’t suggest the access 125 for the lack of products, but for the perks that it offers at a good price point. The scooter is light, fuel-efficient, looks good, quite utilitarian too but more importantly, manageable in all conditions.",Suzuki
"I have been using your suzuki access 125 since 2017, although the performance of the vehicle is very good,the riding experience is very good.Access 125 is the best gearless vehicle for ride. It is very beautiful vehicle,better seating and very smooth vehicle. I have get 54km/h mileage after the third service, i am happy.",Suzuki
"1.Good product in price range.2.Good riding, not amazing not bad.3.Love it's modern classic look. Comfortable ride, average is nearly same as it's competitors.4.Service is good. Very good at maintenance.5.Pros:- body, looks & design, overall good riding, less maintenance etc.Cons:- similar to every scooter first is low mileage, engine is power pack but lacks smoothness, noise is loud etc.",Suzuki
"It is a very good choice, if you want a good riding experience . Its look is also good especially in matte black. And the disc brake edition is awesome. But the main problem with it is it's engine suddenly off and if you are not a good rider then you can make a traffic for others , it's self start is good so you can immediately starts it too.",Suzuki
The scooter looks is good Suzuki access 125 mileage is good than other scooters in this price Suzuki access 125 price is good and a common man buy this scooter for good satisfaction.And the speed of this scooter is nice than other. And i want to buy the suzuki access 125 and i want to recommend suzuki access 125 to all scooter lovers and who want to bay a low price but best mileage and awesome look scooter so this scooter is best for all peoples..,Suzuki
"Maintenance is lesser on this vehicle.....Looks is amazing, it's finishing is nice, seat colour (leather) mirror set, chrome headlight......Mainly it's riding comfortable....... Services are not so expensive and maintenance cost very low compared with other.......Pros storage capacity, cons nothing.......",Suzuki
"Hi i would like to share some info about my all new suzuki access 125 it's been almost 3500k kms Buying experience was easy and hassle free. Riding is good comfortable big and a bully in it's alignment Looks as the body is hard and has a muscular appeal.Servicing has been a problem as my first service i have addressed then the problem of a very poor mileage that is like a bullet 350 it's giving me only 30-35 kmpl. Pros and cons Better to improve mileage and as promised it should be ""kam peeta hai""Not ""mera khoon peeta hai"".",Suzuki
"Buying experience was great. All formalities and accessories fitted on same day. Ride quality is very good. Its a very dope looking cbs disc special edition. Performance is good in city traffic and suspension is its best part. It handles potholes very well, best in class. Great product from suzuki. Go for it.",Suzuki
"Access is very good option for range vehicles,it's provide 125cc with good mileage.To compare activa and fascino,suzuki access is very good. Don't go options.Now coming with special edition also it provides mobile charging port and disc brake also. Servicing cost is to high to compare other models but engine and comfort is good.",Suzuki
"1.Buying experience Brought it for around 65k o jan 1st,2017 from authorized dealer.I was very happy while purchasing it and getting it delivered after 30 mins like a pizza.I was using another vehicle at the same time i brought this beauty home.2.Riding experience Riding it is always a fun no matter how the road is.I have traveled a lot around the city with access 125.The pickup,acceleration,suspension meet at its fullest.The suzuki sep engine is beast !3.Looks,performance If you have seen access 125 on road,you wont ask about its look.Its probably the best looking bike out there.4.Servicing and maintenance Rode it for more than a year now but never paid for anything extra which was not covered in warranty.Service center was very active in their job.5.Pros*look*mileage*service***cost 6.Cons I would love to see it’s sporty look.No offence,if you want to keep it premium and classic.

"buying experience was good.riding experience is awesome. performance is great.looks are old school service is not good.battery issues are there, workshop doesn't provide alternate battery. within one year battery issues started. they take 15 days to check the battery and doesn't provide alternate battery and after some time they told to change the battery.",Suzuki
"I taught looks like toy scooter but just ride it excellent pick up with super mileage no back pain i will travel 100 kms per day continuously for past two years no back pain best scooter just go for it , previous i had thunderbird sold due to can't maintain it after buying access 125 really the pick up is equal or more than thunderbird you wouldn't believe just test drive you will trust my words thanks.",Suzuki
Pretty good looking bike so i purchased it. This attracts everyone while riding. Low mileage i guess.!!! disc breaks looks pretty awesome. Less weight to handle. Easy to handle. More space to sit on your seat. Tubeless tyre feels nice to ride. Don’t know about the top speed but i know i can win if i race with someone.,Suzuki
"My buying experience is awesome at my nearest suzuki showroom, the staff over their is helpful and polite.Ride of this bike is fully comfortable.About performance till 03 month it's amazing.Last the look is quite attractive except headlight because it looks quite big. Which females don't and they feel this scooty is for male.",Suzuki

"I purchased this  suzuki access 125...A year and run 3800km with no problem  and i must say this is the perfect scooter as compare to other in every thing..Digital meter and electric startup and tubeless tyre,front disc brake,and charging point in it,and a space under the seat to keep helmet also....",Suzuki
"We purchased accsses 125 from vr susuki two years back.Riding experience excellent and superb. It's look like hi-fi, and elegant , mass look Trouble less mechanism of suzuki . Well trained workers for service, mostly maintenance free scooter. Totally i like this scooter very very much and i will refer to my friend this scooter only.",Suzuki
"i bought the vehicle end of Jan 2018.  To this day is clocked 5800 kms.  This scooter turns off while riding.  Sometimes it doesn't starts.  For every service i am mentioning it, but they are not considering it.  Also the service is very poor.  Buying experience also very bad.  Power of headlight is low.",Suzuki
This is good scooty for daily use to travel in city in traffic time. Best for family also easily 2 people can accommodate. Good pickup and mileage. This is best for disk brake in special edition. Good performance for latest version suzuki access comparing to previous model. I suggest all to purchase suzuki access special edition.,Suzuki
I have a good experience when i bought this vehicle from the dealer. They all are very co operative and friendly. Riding this bike. For more than 22 years still there is no problem with it. I am getting a mileage of 55 for short trips. And i gone to moonnarvin this scooter. That was a cool ride.  I think we ride this bike for more than 400 kms total. No problem for the scooter.,Suzuki

"Model: suzuki access 125, special edition, matte black, disc and cbs. The following review is based on our family ownership of five months of access 125 (4500 kms) and the tradition of owning scooters since their inception.The buying experience was very easy because we bought it unfinanced, the fall guard accessories came with the package itself and the staff was very supportive. Therefore, before jumping right into the pros and cons of the access 125 let me tell you how it feels to ride it. As you sling forward your legs around the foot board and rest yourself on its tan coloured, plush and wide faux leather (extremely good quality) seat, you feel the good build and finish right away, you get an inkling that the time duration of your commute is going to be pleasant and effortless. This is how i would like to describe this scooter, it is pleasant and effortless.Let us begin with its looks/styling: we have the scooter in matte black colour, the colour and the plastics seem of good quality. It has a quite neutral look; the matte colour makes it look modern, at the same time the chrome bezel around the headlamp and wide trapezoidal rear-view mirrors (also chrome) give it a retro-ish look. Neutral being the keyword, it is not different when looking from the front or the back, but the side profile is where it shines, the curves and the silver badging are tell-tale signs of its good looks. It is not an all-out retro scooter like the tvs jupiter classic but not a sporty one too like the tvs ntorq; the looks are as neutral, something like a honda activa but it definitely comes with a character. So it is indeed for everybody, the students, the parents, the elders; access 125 se is a great example of spot-on styling which is neutral yet attractive.Performance & fuel efficiency: linear and purposeful; the engine is smooth, it is teflon smooth, i used to be a honda fan and used to sing about its refinement and quality but this 125cc plant has got me good. It manages to generate 8.7 ps of power at 7000 rpm with a decent 10.2 n-m of torque. The low and the mid-range are excellent; which is enough to zip around the city for running errands and commutes. The initial torque is great for quick move-ons i.E. 0-40 kmh, it eagerly lunges into motion with a little twist of the throttle. The mid-range is rather linear because it takes its time to accelerate to the speeds of 60-70 kmh, which is not as laggy but is certainly not as quick as the low range. It means that overtakes are possible but with some care. The access 125 se is definitely not a highway runner because it does not provide the rider with enough confidence at higher speeds, the top speed can be easily stretched till an indicated 100 kmh but it is not its home turf, highways have never been a natural habitat for scooters anyways. Vibrations however are excellently well contained throughout the power band which is a huge plus. Overall, the performance of the access 125 se is more than adequate; a nimble low end, linear mid-range and an alright high-end. The 125cc engine is a fuel sipper; suzuki claims 64 km/l but one can easily expect 50 km/l with careful usage and 45 km/l with mixed usage in the street as well as on highways. The 5.6 litre fuel tank provides a decent range for long runs.  Handling, breaking and, ride quality: the access 125 is an absolute gem at handling, its 102 kg weight makes it a very light handler at extremely slow speeds; and at medium-high speeds too it is effortlessly manoeuvrable. Taking tight turns or u-turns have never been a problem due to its short turning radius. Breaking too is confident on the access 125, with 120mm disc at the front and 120mm drum at the back with cbs that provides excellent stopping power and safety. However, the 12 inch front and 10 inch rear tubeless tyres have an acceptable amount of grip but such good brakes could use a pair of grippier tyres because the rear tyre tends to lock up at times. Ride quality is an area which i can claim to be the best in class; the telescopic front and the rear swing arm effortlessly soak up bumps and potholes that are littered across our indian roads, as if the rider’s body never has to lose contact with the seat. The 160mm ground clearance is deceivingly tall that does not let the lower body scrape on speed bumps even when it’s loaded with a substantial amount of weight.Features and ergonomics: the access 125 se is not particularly a feature rich scooter, the headlamp, tail light, and indicators are all halogens and not leds. Despite the lack of leds, throw from the headlamp is very good. It comes with aho that eliminates the light on/off switch and the addition of a kill switch would have been appreciated. The horn too is adequately loud without being annoying; the scooter gets a 12v dc port for mobile charging with a pocket located in the front dash. It does not have an external fuel lid but accessing the under seat lid is easy because it can be twist opened from the main keyhole. The trapezoidal chrome rear view mirrors are extremely useful because of their width; a full panoramic view of the road behind you is available at just a glance. There is no side stand indicator or an under seat storage light, however, the storage space of 21.8 l is at par with the competition with similar shape but the seat hinge at the front does not feel as sturdy as it should have. The instrument cluster houses an analogue speedometer and a small digital display with read outs such as odometer, trip a and b, oil change indicator and a fuel meter. Ergonomics is also an area where this scooter shines, the seat at 780mm is neither low nor high, and the rider sits upright on a plush wide seat with hands on slightly high set handlebars, even the tallest person will not have their knees knocking the handlebars.Cons/ slight inconveniences:1.The engine exhaust note is not very pleasing; the engine even when not stressed makes quite a deal of noise and that is also the reason which makes a rider uncomfortable at higher speeds.2.	The rear wheel tends to lock up at times when only the rear brake is applied; it should not because it has cbs that should avoid locking up to an extent.3.	The matte black paint gets dirty very easily because of its rough surface, needs frequent cleaining.4.	The under seat hinge feels very flimsy. Foot pegs for the pillion rider are very short. 5.	The headlamps could have been all leds; drls are missing.6.	The digital instrument cluster could be way better and larger with bigger font.Conclusion: the suzuki access 125 se is as i said is effortless to use, it is great for running errands and for relaxing evening rides with your significant other. It is versatile, reliable, powerful, and again, effortless to use. It is one scooter that does everything and looks good while doing that. If you feel bored from your old honda activa and are looking for a classy upgrade, this is it, certainly it does not have the edgy looks of honda grazia or the performance and features of tvs ntorq but this scooter nails the basics so good that it fares better than its rivals; because features can get old, looks may not remain that edgy after some years but the class will remain, the refined, fuel efficient engine will remain, the great ride quality will remain.",Suzuki
Product is good but service is very poor dealer only cheating customer .In showroom no any contact no display in show room due to this reason no one can complain against dealer. Also dealer takes more money .I bought scooty in bhubaneswar jyot motors patiya they are not listening to my issue.It very bad impression showing in market against suzuki product.I highly dissatisfied with this company.,Suzuki
"First and best bike ever. It's really good in terms of mileage smooth driving excellent design, colour, it's sound and even service facility is very nice and overall it's really good compare to other bikes. I am completely & strongly recommending to buy this bike. Colour of the bike is good it's running with more than 150 kilos of weight. Really i like it...",Suzuki
"I had wonderful experience with suzuki dealer who had given very good service during the time of booking and delivery. Enjoy to ride. Very nice and catchy look and good performance.  Well maintained by me with the dealers support. I am not in a mind to sell this bike anymore, it's good product by suzuki.",Suzuki
"Pros:looks, pickup, space, comfortunder seat storage is very generousdidn't test mileage, but indication of good mileage is already therecons:compulsory oil change during free service making the term ""free service"" no meaning. I drove only 125km during first service. but had to change oil for 450rs.",Suzuki
"A fantastically amazing beast for daily automatic two wheeler drivers..... The comfort level has increased from before and the boot size and the seat size also have increased.... Lightweight and the dashing look attract people... It has a sharp design and ground clearance has also increased..... With a superb mileage and a bigger fuel tank, it also has the digital speedometer and fuel indicator.... It gives superb balance to short height people and is easy to ride... The best part is it has disc brake and increased and better pickup with new switch system and also provides a mobile charging point... A low cost maintenance and fast service of suzuki makes it a perfect vehicle for middle class person as it has a very reasonable price...",Suzuki
"When it comes to the scooter market in India, almost all scooters have calmly settled at the 110cc, 8bhp mark. It's as if they thought Indians really din't need a more powerful scooter. A few years ago, if you needed something more powerful than the activa, your only option was a suzuki access this is very nice riding bike.",Suzuki
"Yes the bike is good in looks and powerful but lacks safety. Its a good bike but braking and suspension of the bike should be improved, but the speed and pick is best! if you forget to service your bike am sure suzuki will remind you. And compared to all the moped this one has everything in it's console. It has 2 trip meters. Digital odo and fuel gauge. The spare parts and the body parts are cheap of access 125. You won't spend more than 1k per service for sure until you've met with an accident!! well you can go for the bike if your a city user and that city shouldn't have much of pot holes for sure. One thing best in bike is it doesn't have any vibrations!! that's all!!",Suzuki
"Best in class, raiding is very good, suzuki access  125 average 62 km per litre, very good scooter make by suzuki,suzuki access 125 is very comfortable. Thanks suzuki is make access 125 .I am very happy to purchase is suzuki access 125.Suzuki access 125 customer service is very nice. I am very happy to purchase is suzuki access 125.",Suzuki
I am really happy with performance of this access 125. I have bought this bike last year and it been a nice ride since then. Best part of this bike is seat position which  i think developed after lot of research. As i drive 50+km everyday then i also i never feel the pinch.Service cost is almost nil and average of bike is reasonable 42+ to be precise.,Suzuki
"It's a perfect scooter for everyday use. Stylish, well built, practical and economical. It's an all rounder. Riding height is very good for tall riders. Service network of suzuki is also good. It's hard to find flaws in this scooter. Pickup is swift and steady ride. Breaking is reliable and efficient. It's an eye catcher on the roads. Amazing!",Suzuki
"1. Sales is good from the showroom executives.2. You will get a amazed riding experience with comfort 3. Some more height for seat is required , performance is awesome 4.. Servicing from the suzuki service center doesn't met the requirements all the time .I did not find much differences after every service got done by them .. Service is not good .. But for warranty purpose we need to get it done by authorised service centres only.5. Need to have regular services done .. Otherwise engine sound will changes .",Suzuki
Engine very refine and good sound no problem in mountains roads space large site size long very comfortable colour many metal and fiber combination is perfect so i recommend this.This scooter is family scooter go to long road and travelling mobile charger split available weight is lighter other scooter.,Suzuki
"I have been using suzuki access 125 for more than 1 year now.It is a very good bike. Riding experience is very good. Breaking and storage capacity are also better. It is a nice looking scooter with excellent performance. Service was not very good but okay.Pros*good riding performance*good storage and breaking*high power. Cons*position of head lamp is not good,hard to ride in nights.*more time is needed for self starting*i am getting mileage about 40 kmpl only.",Suzuki
It is a good looking bike . My one matt black colour . It's very comfortable with it long seat and with a larger legroom than the old one and it is light weight . It also have a charger point for the mobile .The seats brown colour match with the body colour .It has mag wheels with the disk breakers at the front and the head lights shape is little square shape. I'm satisfied with this bike and really it drinks less.,Suzuki
"A read about the footrest:.1.The footrest for the pillion is the one which is boring and uncomfortable. The 2010 model suzuki access-125 type of footrest is the best i have seen in any scooter or two-wheeler. So, if the company can restore/fix that footrest on all the new model scooters of the company, it will be a great value addition. If that is done it would be an unbeatable scooter with all the user friendly features.2.Similarly, a centre-stand as easy as that of a jupiter would be a great value addition too. 3.And again, a helmet clamp with lock away facility would be great too.4.The rear view mirrors of jupiter and lets are quite fantastic too. So improve it to match them.",Suzuki
This is awesome bike very comfortable and way to easy to ride...It's been almost 4 years for the bike but it still feels like riding new bike ....It's been very beautiful experience and many of my friends are recommended to go for same bike .....I love my bike immense pleasure to ride with such comfort.,Suzuki
"using old access since 2010.All the drawbacks from that are rectified like front suspension,fading of colour,tyre size,seat length, fuel efficiency,front disk brakes are more secure and responsive.,i and odometer in 2018 model.

"Amazing experience while buying scooty in 125cc .....I was totally confused in buying ...Between activa 125cc and suzuki access 125cc ..But finally suzuki access 125 satisfied me totally..As it gave me value for money in 125cc segment.It is best in looks , brakes (with alloy and cbs with disc), mileage,performance,etc...I mean to say in every prospective ...Awesome ...",Suzuki
"The service was great, riding is in comfort, royal blue colour is awesome, servicing and maintenance by showroom is supportive, extended 5 years warranty, 2 years insurance, pickup is awesome, average is good, you can feel suspension is great one, fabulous look, one can go on long drive as it is full of comfort.",Suzuki
"Suzuki access 125 is the bike to rely upon for your daily city commute & more.I can vouch for her reliability, refinement, comfort and no nonsense attitude.It is a very solid machine which will not rattle for years.For sure.Want to buy a machine which will talk back & reassure you for doing that extra work,go for the suzuki.",Suzuki
It is a good looking bike . My one matt black colour . It's very comfortable with it long seat and with a larger legroom than the old one and it is light weight . It also have a charger point for the mobile .The seats brown colour match with the body colour .It has mag wheels with the disk breakers at the front and the head lights shape is little square shape. I'm satisfied with this bike and really it drinks less.,Suzuki

Good as sporty as well as comfort.Keep it up the good quality and service. Thanks.",Suzuki
I have purchased this scooter on june 2018. It is best scooter considering it's competitors in segment either its look or its pickup. I am 6 feet and sitting position of this scooter is very comfortable for me. I am very satisfied with this purchase.I have also rode activa but its seat is very low and activa also look very feminine and looks like it is being made for girls only.,Suzuki

  I plan to buy a 125cc scooter and keep it for about 7-8 years. Between the Suzuki Access and Mahindra Rodeo which is a better choice.,Suzuki
"""SUZUKI ACCESS 125"" is fantastic bike. It is very comfortable to use.",Suzuki
# Engine oil replacement is suggested at an interval of 7500km but service centres replace it every 2000km.,Suzuki
# Front appron rattling at speed of around 20-25kmph (while stopping) is gone after switching to Power1. Another sign of smoother engine.,Suzuki
"# Hella horn always make sure that I am always heard, even on the highways.",Suzuki
# I feel 10W40 grade engine oil should suit best for Indian climatic conditions. Really wonder why Service centres use 5W30.,Suzuki
# I got rear flat tyre once. So I sourced a tuff up tube from friendly Honda people- end of worries:),Suzuki
"# I have shifted onto Castrol Power1 (10W-40) Engine oil. Consequently, engine has become smoother and (mild) tappet noise has reduced.",Suzuki
# Mild whistling noise from transmission was cured in last service.,Suzuki
# My rear MRF Zapper has aged and needs replacement. 15000+ km life for a scooter tyre is worth mentioning.,Suzuki
# Outstanding Milage for a scooter- 50.91 kmpl ( I maintain a log book for fueling. 111.6 liters consumed in last 5682 kms.),Suzuki
# Performance and acceleration is almost as zippy as it was 15 months before.,Suzuki
# Rear shock absorber is bit hard for solo riding. Thinking of replacing it with some other manufacturer's (considering Nova135. Its adjustable).,Suzuki
# Superb cornering ability and straight line stability. Stability while braking is even more confidence inducing.,Suzuki
# Suzuki recommends engine oil replacement after 4000km but service centres replace it every 2000km.,Suzuki
"# Though I had made alterations with headlight setup ( a flasher connected to battery through a switch and relay), and changed stock horn with Hella 60 Watts horn, my battery is still in top class state.",Suzuki
"#1. Mileage: This scooter claims 65 KM/L but honestly it is not even 35, yes 35 KM/L. I know only about city.",Suzuki
#2. Comfort: It's was comfortable initially but the rear suspension had some issue and though it was around 10 months only but I had to be changed and I had to pay for it because it was not covered in 1 year warranty and is subject to usage/handling. It's shocker has issue and you'll have to invest on it regularly.,Suzuki
#3. Reliability: It's not reliable because of less mileage and comfort but also because the battery or may be auto start many time fails and if you have a bad knee then you have to use the kick. This makes it irreliable.,Suzuki
#4. Road Grip: This's something that's not dependent on scooter I think and I dependent on tire. My brand new scooter had Apollo tires and that's not the best tires in market and are cheapest and I had few near miss accident also on damped roads.,Suzuki
#5. Appeal: It has a good appeal not doubt about it. It looks as a competitor to many in this segment but it fails to deliver.,Suzuki
"& coming to the service point well suzuki has got good services & they r giving free services uptill 12 services ie a year and a galf. Well that also includes paid services but then no 1 gives more than 4 free services.So suzuki also scores here & coming to the point of maintenance & new engine trubles, well my nike has not given me a single 1 & touchwood I hope it keeps it up.",Suzuki

"(Mohammad)confirmed that stock is readily available and can deliver the bike on next day itself(but without doing RTO), since I will not able to visit the show room multiple times for rto and extra fittings, I asked the sales person to complete all the work and deliver the bike and the sales guy confirmed that he will call and delivery the bike on or before 08 June. Since I did not receive any calls I called up Mohammad to take deliver, he said RTO is not yet done and he will give invoice, user manual and tool kit. So I went to the showroom to take the delivery but they did not give me the tool kit, user manual and extended warranty and RTO work not done, just delivered the bike. He said it will be done by this evening(8th june), no call received from that sales person, so 09 June I called up again and explained my urgency and asked for registration number as we cant use the bike on road without registration number. He(Mohammad) suddenly became very rude and started using bad words, while booking he was very polite and behaving like very good mannered. They showed their real attitude when I questioned them their promise which they did not like and said you can complain to anybody(he said you can even go and talk to the owner of show room, any way I will surely explain this incident to the management if I get chance).",Suzuki

*A ray of beam shoots  straight upwards right in front of you which is quit disturbing while driving.,Suzuki
"*I am getting Access 125 CC tommorrow(20th Dec 2007). The Look is excellent and driving is a pleasure. I went for a speedy test drive. You have more space for keeping lot of things including your helmet down under the seat. You have a excellent suspension.You have a centralised locking system. The fuel tank capacity is also more and you fill it once and forget the fuelling often. The engine sounds great. it is XTP. I hope it will keep the mileage good. None of the suzuki product is failed in mileage so far. I waited for almost two months for this vehicle to launch in Chennai. this is the best scooter I have seen so far. I am driving scooter since 1997. I have used kinetic honda, scooty, honda activa. to my knowledge so far this is the best. Thanks to Suzuki for a wonderful job. Srinivasan V",Suzuki

-Mileage- suzuki access 125 mileage is 45kmp which is very less. It is very hard to fill the fuel,Suzuki
-Road Grip- Road grip of suzuki access 125 is less. While driving brakes are pressed person sitting behind seat fall on the driver. Suzuki access 125 slips more while front brakes are used.,Suzuki
"-The engine of course is 125 cc higher than activa which also increases its weight but surprisingly it feels very light while driving and pick up is also gud. The engine is Suzuki's Xtra Torque Performance technology for better low end punch, resulting in good initial pick up. Vibrations and noise levels are also low. So even if you compare it with the other 125 cc ie. Kinetic Flyte, Access is much better.",Suzuki
"-Wouldn’t b so sure about the fuel efficiency coz don’t own one yet but from what they told me at the show room was around 60 kmph, which of course I don believe.",Suzuki
-comfort- During the driving of suzuki access 125 comfort is less when we drive any bick its seat is flat so there should be little improvement in seat making comfort.,Suzuki

.this bike have amazing comfort and control power brakes are amazing and very smooth,Suzuki
"/ Features, Accessories, Handling, Performance, Mileage and Service. Also added a few tips at the end.",Suzuki
"1)  activa- has a bit heavier body(probably due to its metallic body) but on the same side it is lower thanaccess which has a higher ground clearance, but if you compare the comfort level activa has the edge here, access nowhere lies near activa in terms of comfortable ride activa gives you.",Suzuki
"1) Excellent pickup = v.good for traffic roads, you can go with out any hustle.",Suzuki
1) Milage - 50 - 55 KMPL(I drive 50 KMS per day with an average speed of 35 - 45 KMPH in the Chennai city). The route that I take is perhaps not all that crowded. I still have to hit the city traffic.,Suzuki
"1) Poor service at authorised service centres, they are like parasites, thriving repeat visits without clearing existing faults and continuously the vehicle develops new ones.",Suzuki
"1) Somewhat weight, ladies may feel tough to put center stand & also to lift the vehicle when needed (Lifting in rear)",Suzuki
1) TVS Jupiter 2) Honda Activa 125 3) Honda Activa 110 4) Suzuki Access 125.,Suzuki
1) the exhausst silencer could be litlle inclined to match the body incline style,Suzuki
1) the exhausst silencer might be litlle inclined to match the body incline vogue,Suzuki
"1, I swear I will never go to unauthorized workshop even though authorized workshop is incapable.",Suzuki
"1, This is decent scooter for family. When you see the Seat length, it is bigger than any other Scooter. that is great advantage for the 4 or 3 people family. The storage is also good enough to carry baby cloth, bottle with necessary things. in addition you will get charging port.",Suzuki
1- Costlier than any other middle class scooty with cheap fiber body all around.,Suzuki
"1- This scooter look stylish, the seat of scooter is bigger than any other scooter in short it is family scooter. It may carry atleast 3 person in his seat.",Suzuki
1- it has 2 handling plugs one on front and 2nd on the down side of the seat.,Suzuki
"1. Shoulder Pain / Handle is too stiff: Place the scooter on the main stand. Now lift her up a little bit and place a brick under the main stand. This way, the front wheel won't touch the ground. Now, push the handle gently.",Suzuki
"1.) Build quality and design - first, comparing the 2017 access with its own older models of 2014 and 2015. The build quality has been significantly changed with good quality plastics used in its body.",Suzuki
1.Fuel Consumption-As is moped and has small fuel its quite inconvenient to again and again refuel its a little headache but its has amazing mileage 55kmpl.,Suzuki
1.My speedo cable sheared off in just 2000kms - it is due to the sharp bend that the cable sees at the exit of the worm gear assembly. This is a design flaw as other modern scooters feature the cable entering from the rear end of the front wheel and make the bends more long-radius like.,Suzuki
1.The mileage of this scooty is about 65kmpl on highways and it is about 50kmpl on dense roads.,Suzuki
"1.Tyres rims worst design Driving experience was a breeze.This scooty fits well for people of any age group, Suzuki was finally successful in crushing honda activa series",Suzuki
"1.Very few centers available. If you find and reached to any one, nobody will assist you.",Suzuki
1.low mileage-I average 20000kms every year and cost/km for access was 2.4₹! Where as my dio was so good that it returned 58-60kmpl!! And harly 1.2₹/km and i used to commute to my collrge up a & down 75kms on that on double. So with the high running cost of access i would lose nearly 20-25K just on fuel.,Suzuki
1.price. best and better suzuki access 125 it was a very good and ti is the very resoable price you get I give you free advice to you when ever you have to buy the bike that time it hjust a buy in the best occasion and the special price.,Suzuki
10.- Water drops get entered in air filter bcause air filter is placed beside the rear tyre and due to splash water get accumulated initialy over the filter casing the later in side the filter and later to the Carburetor. It is very obvious that it will have a very poor resale value.,Suzuki
"105 Gopal Bhawan Museum Ke Saamne M.S Road . Pech Morena, Madhya Pradesh, India India",Suzuki
"10th Service done today. At the time of last service itself , I have told them that while breaking there is noise. Did not attend.Today also, I have informed the official the same thing. Didn't attend.There is ample scope for improvement in service.The vehicle is not properly air dried after service.",Suzuki
12 kms back home in heavy traffic for at least 3/4th distance.,Suzuki
125 CC engine is very firm and attains speed in less time which means pick up is great.,Suzuki
125cc engine is powerful but main reason behind low average and somehow pickup.,Suzuki
"125cc engine makes it capable of early pick up and produces 8.58 bhp, which is sufficient for a fast scooter.",Suzuki
135 DTSi and it's owner manual does not even show from where the engine oil has,Suzuki
15 months of trouble free service of Access has proved its reliability and durability. A very dependable dynamic scooter indeed.,Suzuki
1:- Fuel consuption:- Mileage of Suzuki Access 125 is 45-50 kilometer per litter.,Suzuki
1:-THE ENGINE CAPACITY ITS 125CC WHILE COMPARING TO OTHER 125CC SCOOTER PICK-UP OF ACCESS IS AWESOME AND ACCESS IS MAINLY FAMOUS FOR ITS PICK-UP .,Suzuki

"1st Floor, Shakti Enclave, Opp. BSNL Exchange, Kankaria, Maninagar",Suzuki
1st day I have starting prbl battery aso week not working properly in short.,Suzuki
2) Comfort - the shocks are great and the vehicle is quite stable. I was driving a bike before. So took couple of weeks to get used to the seating posture. Was surprised that this one is even more comfortable than a bike. It is pretty smooth.,Suzuki
2) Excellent riding comfort. (No tiredness even after 200km travel).Good clearance against Speedbreakers and Pot holes.,Suzuki
2) Headlight makes sure moon is seen. (One pointed beam goes vertically above),Suzuki
2) I eliminated Honda Activa 125 because of:- Care a damn attitude by the Sales woman at Silicon Honda.,Suzuki
2) Problem during kick start in the morning(But no problem in Self start),Suzuki
2) Those who are less height may feel discomfort in driving or pillion seat (for longer distance),Suzuki
"2) mileage- not much difference, both companies boast about 50km/l but in real its less than 40.",Suzuki
"2, I think my scooter will run for next 7 years without any bypass surgery.",Suzuki
"2, We have option of desk break, water bottle holder, bright light. etc.",Suzuki
2- Company claim that this scooter gives a mileage 64 kmpl but honestly its give me around 50 to 55 kmpl.,Suzuki
2. Even when I touched the speed of 65 kmph the scooter was damn sturdy and the biggest fact I did not know that it had reached those speeds until I gave a look on the speedo meter as the bike was damn smooth. NO SHAKING OR TREMBLING .,Suzuki
"2. Headlight is pointing towards the International Space Station: There is a nut under the headlight. Point the scooter towards an open stretch, and adjust to your satisfaction. Remember to be gentle.",Suzuki
"2.) Performance and comfort - while talking about the comfort first, the width of the seat has been increased very much and well cushioned and honestly, probaly the most comfortable.Even more comfortable then its biggest rival Activa 125 Also, the body shape remains same without any weight.",Suzuki
2.Average - 35-40 Kmpl is you are a rough driver Otherwise 40-50 Kmpl if u drive Between 30-45 Kmpl.,Suzuki
2.Comfort-The height is a quite tall and the seat is very uncomfortable it is very hard to sit.,Suzuki
"2.Mileage is too low, its 30 for me (i.e. I have placed it to backyard).",Suzuki
2.Riding this scooty is quite comfortable and its suspension system is very good.,Suzuki
2.unreliable! Brakes used to fade away very often.the clutch had issues.very bad service.,Suzuki
2016 suzuki acess 125 gracious looks hamdsame desingThe overall silhouette remains tha same as the olderModel but with the additon of same same new desingElements there s a new retro looking headlight with aFat chrome strip around it the side panels have beenRedesigened too and there s the adition of a 3D logoAs well as a shiny chrome ex haust muffler the changesAre subtle but they work welland will appeal to wideRange of prospective costomers this scooty is vary vary good I like this scooty,Suzuki
2:- Comfort:- This is very comfortable bike and is the worst bike ever I had seen. I THink This is good and comfortable for girls.Girls easily ride this bike.i suggest to girls plzz buying this kind of bikes. beacuse this is very good for girlz.,Suzuki
2> Worst approach towards solving issue. That is the reason I prefer Castrol bike zone rather than official / authorized service station.,Suzuki
2>looks - it is better in looks and some different design. better colors than activa,Suzuki
"3 break downs so far. compressor problem, spark switch problem, starting problem.",Suzuki
"3 months waiting! This is the killer, but can't help it as Suzuki delivers only about 100 units per month to the city. I am hoping the scenario is the same in other cities as well.",Suzuki
"3 years ownership experience, this bike has good amount of power but at the same time the braking isn't as good as it should have been. Mileage is bit on a lower side as it has a 125cc engine , Suzuki could have done better here.It has good back suspension whereas the front shocks aren't quiet good.",Suzuki
"3) I eliminated Honda Activa 110 because of:- Its antiquated front suspension and unacceptable quality of certain parts like switches, Levers",Suzuki
3) Reliability - Might be little too early to comment. But so far it has been spot on.,Suzuki
"3) Service center is 25 KM away. And people managing work station, never want to improve. Even after explaining time management, they don't want to even think about it, for themselves or for customers.",Suzuki
"3) Since the HP is more, U turning in narrow roads is risky as the engine try to push the vehicle suddenly with very low engine noise.",Suzuki
"3) large storage capacity. (when ever go for shopping , will dump as much in under seat & basket )",Suzuki
3)Engine bearing worn out purchased on july 2015 as running is very low.,Suzuki
"3, I am traveling every day(two way) around 60 kms. this scooter never disappoint me. because the scooter is having 12 inch front wheel and 10 inch back wheel. so by default you will able to experience closure handle position. it will help you in long rider without back pain. it will good for all type of height people.",Suzuki
"3- Having engine problem of oil leak from head of engine, later on leads to damage of engine piston and costly engine work.",Suzuki
3- This scooter is 102 kg in weight. Its lighter than other scooter in market.,Suzuki
3- because of its good weight it gives high power engine of 125cc,Suzuki
"3. Poor Mileage: 1 Minute warm up(idling) from cold start. If you are not pressing the brakes while driving, then do talk to the service station to get your engine tuned. It's pretty simple to fix.",Suzuki
3.Body - mainly madup of fibre matirial ao breaks When u have a accident So I suggest you to install a proper accesesories,Suzuki
3.Poor quality spare parts used and still very expensive (even more than Honda).,Suzuki
3.Reliability-It is very reliable it works great in all conditions it has nice pickup it runs fast engine makes lot noise.,Suzuki
3.bad suspension - the TVS scooties and the Wego are way way better.,Suzuki
3.central locking - one can open the boot from the ignition switch assembly,Suzuki
3.tyer. this suzuki tyer are very good and very well done made and you can see the suzuki access 125 tyer design it was a very good and it was  a ell done made it if you are to be a buy the bike that time you can see the lifetime of the tyer and any kind of the product it was a very good,Suzuki
3:- Reliability:- This is very good bike ever. ANd Good For reliability.,Suzuki
"3:-AVERAGE= ACCESS:-54KL/LIT,WHILE ON COMPARING WITH ACTIVA=40-48KM/LIT",Suzuki
"3> Customers are treated a beggars, as if  they are doing UPKAR.",Suzuki
3rd comes control talking about control is not that bad good handling. If I have to rate this bike in good/ very good or bad I wall rate it as good but the most important aspect is service and spear-parts that are not available in the market easily. We need to order it and the delivery time is 1 week,Suzuki
"4 - no free moment even it steep, poor torque, poor service from suzuki. they do not bother about to put back I m potent pairs like screw, nuts boltes etc, with this you can understand for what good reason we should go to other brand except suzuki. 24 km the engine has started giving problem inquired with several access cut the worst service and engine problem after 18 km.",Suzuki
4 more power as compare to other 125cc.all over its like angel on road.pls must buy.,Suzuki
4) Even though the company said  120 km speed is achievable I can't able to reach above 70 Km speed.,Suzuki
4) Handling - I was skecptical initially and had my own questions on switching over from a bike to a scooter. I have no complaints though. The handling has been great and the comfort level is amazing.,Suzuki
4) Needs service every 2 months. Atleast thats what suzuki says. Otherwise warranty is void.,Suzuki
4)Poor service centre performance as comment is service is done on sunday & due to rush checking is not proper.,Suzuki
"4)pickup- definitely access, 0-60 in just 6-7 seconds, activa takes bit more time",Suzuki
"4, The engine is super smooth and noise less. the power of 125 make you more comfortable.",Suzuki
4- This scooter also available in disk brake. That give you better grip on road.,Suzuki
"4- it has a Engine vibration issue , which can not be rectified.",Suzuki
4.Dealership center guys are liar - They will tell you the service charges are 200 and overall service cost will not go more than 350-400 but actuality is service charges are 350+Tax.,Suzuki
4.Handling-It is quite disappointing but the brakes are not much good the bike skids instead of immediate stopping.,Suzuki
4.Teflon coating free service coupon(only if u opted for teflon coating as accessories),Suzuki
4.This scooty has 125cc engine which is very good and acceleration of this scooty is superb.,Suzuki
4.decent mileage - get approx 40kmpl in rotten Chennai traffic.,Suzuki
4:- Handling and Control:- Very Very Easy To handling and Control. This is veri Beautiful bike.,Suzuki
4>Power - access wins by 25Cc over activa. and you can feel it when you ride it.,Suzuki
5) Easy to ride in hills.Also getting the same mileage (40Km/lt) in hills also.,Suzuki
"5) Even though suzuki has recommended clearly oil changes in alternate services, service center's want to change oil and air filter and charge for consumables to make that extra buck.",Suzuki
5) Looks - Wel. To me my red access looks really attractive with clean professional finish that meets international standards.,Suzuki
5) There is no way you can reach the company and its engineers.,Suzuki
"5) boot space - not very much difference, my helmet fits in both but I found that leg space is more in access.",Suzuki
"5, I am able to get around 50 to 52 kmpl. that is decent in city. please keep in mind even the 100 and 110 cc scooters offering the same.",Suzuki
5- initial acceleration gets down after some time which is again costly to repair as whole drive disc and shoes is to be changed.,Suzuki
5.After sale company and service center no body will provide you assistance As no body from company or dealership is willing to improve after sale service and dealership network pls think 10 times before buying Suzuki bikes.,Suzuki
5.Avaibality of parts - some parts are not avialable at local shops You have to buy it from Suzuki showroom,Suzuki
5.In looks its a great combination of steel and fiber the headlight and exhaust looks awesome.,Suzuki
5.nice and stylish look even boys can have it and girls can also enjoy this.,Suzuki

"6) servicing - worst service, the workers wont listen, every time they would do something that you will have to deal with, totally irresponsible, poor washing. Suzuki must look into this matter.

"====DAY 10(June 28, 2008-100kms): I am facing serious battery problems with Access, with in just 10 Days of purchase. Its very disappointing.. Button Start is dead.. And to do a kick start is a himalayan task...coz u can kick start the Access only after placing it on Main stand.. I dont think anyone can place that 109 kg giant on main stand that easily... :( .. Even if I do kick start, it doesnt get started easily.. it requires 3 to 5 kicks in the morning time !! Horn is really horrible. not even a dog will move after hearing that ! when u slow down for a hump or so and try to use the horn.. its sounds like a cat's voice coming from Lion's mouth... Is this the problem in all Access vehicles or in mine only ? I am not sure.. But when I think of the 50k which I have paid, to face all these... its so annoying! Mileage is around 45 before 1st service.. But what do I do with the mileage if my 2 wheeler doesnt start at all !! I am goin to the dealer, will let u guys know the rest soon...",Suzuki
"====DAY 18(July 5, 2008 - 350 kms): I went to the service center and got my battery replaced in my Access. Now Button start is working fine. The engine goes off if I reduce my speed or just stop raising the accelerator :( .. Starting the Vehicle in the morning is not a easy deal till now !! It goes off again and again ! Lemme c if it gets fixed in the next service...",Suzuki
"====DAY 30(July 18, 2007 - 500Kms): I face absolutely no problems with my access these days...All Well.. And I must say, it has the best pick up compared to any other bikes/scooters in market, the moment the signal goes green, my access takes me far ahead of all other vehicles stuck in the signal!! its really a wow thing suzuki guys have worked on ..Will go for first service this month End..",Suzuki
"====DAY 82(SEPT 8, 2008 - 1400 Kms): I dont want to see this day again even in my nightmares! Its rainy season in bangalore now, I started from my office around 6.30 pm, It was raining heavily, I was just 3 km away from home, My Access behaved very wierly, it became too slow though I gave full throttle and it finally stopped. I tried kick starting, tried with choke but all in vain. it got started but the scooter does not move at all ! I started dragging the 109 kgs giant in the heavy rain.. I realised how nice would be if I would have gota light weight scooter (scooty type). since my house is in hilly area, I was getting short of breath pulling it. I really felt very sorry for my new scooter, that this 2nd major problem has happened with in just <3 months of purchase... I finally managed to drag it till my home after a long struggle. This morning, my local mechanic told that the engine cud hav been filled with water or some spark plug problem. Its still in the same condition.. If you are driving your access in rain, then please be well prepared to face such situations as well. I am very disappointed when I realize the fact that my 4 yr old bajaj spirit, which is half the price of Suzuki Access has never given me this much trouble till date..second service will be sometime in this month... I dont know what problem , access wil give me next month ! God save me :(",Suzuki
"=DAY 120 (Oct 16, 2008) My Access has done ~2500kms. Already 2 services done. One thing I have noticed is that, no matter how regularly you do the service or how much carefully you handle the vehicle.... this scooter will give you some or the other problem once in 15 days :( It was working fine for 1 or 2 weeks after the 2nd service... now the problem is, the engine goes off whenever u slow down!! not just in the morning time!! it can happen anytime... I am waiting for my 3rd service date to visit the service center",Suzuki
"=DAY 165 (Nov 29, 2008) 3400 kms. got the 3rd service done. no starting problem. one thing I strongly agree is that, Access never give problems soon after servicing. but servicing any scooter once in 2 months meticulously is not so easy. I m trying hard to increase the mileage !! I wish I reach 45 kmpl atleast (too greedy hah !!)",Suzuki
"=DAY 84 (Sept 10, 2008) two days later, SUZUKI service person came to my home since I couldnt drag this vehicle for 10+ kms to the service station. He opened all the stuff and poured out 1 lt of water that got collected in the engine. He came with a new Air Filter. He told that most of the Access users face this problem in rain, so the company has sent new Air filter to rectify this problem. Though I couldnt understand the technicalities, I was clear of onething that - Suzuki uses Trial and Error method with its new Products :( .. After all that 2 hours of repairing and replacing the Spark plug.. Access finally started.. I am not that confident driving this scooter now, because I expect it to stop any time/place... Mileage has never been so great compared to Honda Activa. I drive @ 40 to 50 kmph (economy), I have never got anything more than 40 kmpl...whats promised by suzuki is 65 :) Atleast if I get 50, that will be ok.. thats the very reason y ppl choos access over activa I guess. hmm..Now that I have already brought this, cant help !! Prospective Buyers, Please take care !",Suzuki

At a time of riding it vibrate more than other popular mopeds. But one thing is good in this vehicle fuel tank is big and sound is less than other mopeds.

"Access is the only scooter having different unlocking pattern to open dikki, just unlock it by rotating your key in left hand side and for ignition rotate in right side.",Suzuki
Access is very good scooter. It is 125 cc scooter. It have good shape and look. I have 50 km/l mileage. My access scooter's colour is black.it have better pulling,Suzuki
Access is very sure-footed on good and bad roads as well. The handling is excellent. It can handle bad roads easily with much confidence. The handling superioiness is felt on the bends. And the front disc brakes offers a reassuring feel. It is very well composed under hard braking.,Suzuki
Access light and zippy great looks can be drive both male or female and this Suzuki most trusted in around World. Since it was slightly lesser prising than Activa and had lighter fiber body gives better mileage it was a good choice than Activa or others.,Suzuki
Access look better than other scooter in market. Maintenance charges is normal because access have,Suzuki
Access look better than other scooter in market. Maintenance charges is normal because access have fibre body.,Suzuki
Access look better than other scooter in market.Maintenance charges is normal because access have fibre body.,Suzuki
"Access pick up is all that makes access different from other scooty. the previous version is also good . teen age loves this scooty because it is almost comparable to bikes. the handling is good, gives a racing beat to riders. mileage is not so good depends on proper maintenance at right time. it has all it takes to be one of the best scooter. the only problelm with access is that the servicing workshop I mean the local workshops they dont hav much idea about how to repair this. so they cannot give a proper maintenance, this results in break down of the vehicle as time goes. the engine components are quite different from other scooter and most importantly the sync between the parts of the engine espicially the carburetor sync, the oil and engine race is very difficult to fix for this scooter. so with wrong hand it can get spoilt so easily. access is superb you can say but depends on maintenance.",Suzuki
"Access suzuki 125 - dont buy this please. Quality sucks big time. before 8 months the battery discharged and got replaced, the helmet box broke and got replace in 11th month.",Suzuki
"Access suzuki is the best mopad that I have come across with as a personal experience this vehicle is awesome as per the accelaration and mileage as well. According to me the a vehicle should carry 2 hefty person so Access will be the best option rather than pleasure, dio, ray, or the aprilla as the access has a good accelaration it can withstand that weight of even two hefty people who can go as far as they want without any problem. Suzuki's engine is the best no problem at all. Cheers",Suzuki
Access to Authorised Suzuki Access Service Centre is difficult,Suzuki
"Access was a widely accepted vehicle after Activa which may loose its market due to worst service levels. Of course, this will affect all the models as the service is done by the same people.I sincerely feel Suzuki should revive it's dealer networks and improve their service levels to a larger extent.",Suzuki
Access was running so much smoothly. On the highway it was gives may be 45km average.,Suzuki
"Access125 using since 6years.prior to this we are having Honda Activa which is also a good vehicle.This vehicle is one of the perfect automobile for family.The best, postive, pros of this vehicle are-This vehicle is very comfortable and light in weight to drive.3mem ( with driver) can easily sit and travel.If you have below 10year old kid he can easily and happily sit infront of the vehicle driver.But in some other vehicles like Honda Activa , Scooty pept, Wego may not give that much comfort as much as Access( comapring in weight) .one more drawback of Honda Activa is its too heavy.Access 125 gives a good mileage.In Highway it can give an easy 55-60km/lit.In city40- 45km/lit.You will not feel unpleasant in grot, crap roads in our country.Gives comfort while travelling on those roads with good shock absorbers.Also gives good pick up.It has got shuttered lock system.A good space beneath the seat to keep groceries, helmet etc., We can raise our speed to 60-80km/hr.You we will feel as if you are travelling in air at that speed.Now the new model has got disc brake too.It has got front pocket now.But some of the cons are-this vehicle stops running when the water levels are high while raining.If not serviced on time the same problem of above arise.Finally a very good vehicle .escpecially comfort and feeling light in weight.even at affordable price from Rs57000-Rs64000.Thankyou.",Suzuki
"Access: Light and zippy, big looks can be driven by both sexes and Suzuki is a trusted engine(my father still drives IND-Suzuki 1983 model). It had identical specs of Activa in terms of looks and power. Since it was slightly lesser priced than Activa and had lighter fiber body with better economy it was a good choice par with Activa.",Suzuki
Accesse-125 scooter is god for drive & comfort but average is down 40km per ltrs.,Suzuki
According My We highly recommend this Suzuki Access 125 scooty and can gives the 4 out of 5 rating. so without waste a time. book now your dream scooty with Suzuki NOW!.,Suzuki
According to me Access 125 nongear vehicle is too osum from my experience the pick up is very nice and average is also so good and from older the new one is very good looking and big and handling is too easy for ladies as well as men and sound is also nice compare to vespa it is very nice .,Suzuki
According to my experience I am giving a small review on suzuki access 125 frankly speaking very nice bike for balancing it is very good height of the seat the way of design for holding.,Suzuki
Acess 125 of suzuki is the worst tvs I haver seen because his race is so fast that one cannot pratice it and is backside brake is to urgent that backside tyre got slip and his rear tyre is so small that when we applied brake to it tyre got slip makes an attempt to got fall and many times access get slip and makes a person fall and causing injury,Suzuki
"Acess scooty it gives good milage, seat is wide, we can sit comfortably, under seat it is more spacious so that we can keep many stuff inside, and suzuki access is available in many colours, now a days it has great demand in the market. it gives top speed of almost 90 kilometer per hour, and it has great power, less mainatainece so every people can afford access, suzuki access has good resale value, it has big fuel tank, the body of suzuki access is designed sexy and stylish, it has good powerfull engine, we can travel long distance because of smooth riding, now a days people prefer more scooty then bikes because it is easy to ride and we can carry stufs, over all suzuki acces is a good scooty when compared to all non gear scootys",Suzuki
Acquired suzuki acess 125 February 2016. From the very first moment I am confronting issue with Suzuki Access 125 head light. . I enlightened them concerning they said bext benefit we will do it. At whatever point I let them know they said the same thing. To begin with administration they let me know i,Suzuki
Activa had waiting time of at least 6 months. during that time access introduced itself in the market and easily clicked with youngsters and adults alike. main thing why it was a hit was because of its ready availability or hardly a months waiting in some colors. It has a fiber body and is less bulky Compared to the metal bodied and heavy activa.,Suzuki
Activa having good road grip and taking U turn is safe. But Access is very danger while taking U turn. Handle bar is smaller and space between seat and handle bar less than activa. So I recommend Activa.,Suzuki
Activa is 100 cc six year old model with no visible change done,Suzuki
"Activa, looks are ok.Technologyn is superb.Mileage iam not satisfied(my frnds are getting very less mileage).Iam ok with both but what to take please suggest.Price wise both are same(iam not sure).Please share ur views so that ia can choose write one.Awaiting ur responses & valuable suggessions.",Suzuki
"Activa: Pretty decent, tried and tested as well. Excellent service standards maintained so far(My sister has one for more than 7 years). However maintenance was little expensive and heavy feel.(My wife is around 52 kgs) for lighter women, additionally was most expensive among scooters of it's kind, yet again this was in top of my list",Suzuki
"Activa; Pretty decent, tried and tested as well. awesome service standards manitained so far(My sister has one for more than 8 years). However maintenannce was some expencive and heavy feel.(My woodbee is around 45 kgs) for lighter girl, additionally was most expensive among scooters of it's kind, yet again this was in top of my list.",Suzuki
"Actually I wanted to book two bikes but thought of booking another one after checking the bike for some time, now I planning to go to Hero motors in KR puram or Ramamurthy nagar for another bike booking and see if they are good(I will deal with them carefully lessons learn here).",Suzuki
"Actually after the service, they forgot to put it back. Me too even opening the storage for n times a day",Suzuki
"Actually, I was wondering why should I use kick when self start option is there. Very next day morning, I tried starting scooter by using self start, but it didn't started then used kick, after 4-5 kick it started. Okay, amy be battery need proper change before we use self, then I thought battery is new then why this problem. Even I heard from my friends that there is no need to use kick even in the morning, it should start by self starter.",Suzuki
"Adar Para(Angshik) , Jalpaiguri, Kotwali, Jalpaiguri - 735101 India",Suzuki
"Advantages: Slightly improved mileage, much smoother, improved acceleration. Engine feels like it's been'just serviced' for at least 1000 KMS compared to the 200-300 KMS odd using mineral engine oil.",Suzuki
"Aesthetically, the Suzuki Access gets a pretty basic design which has continued to age well despite being quite old. The squarish headlamp in integrated on the handlebar while the apron gets pseudo air vents and turn signals. The chrome heat shield and the 3D logo on the body add a bit of flair to the design. The Suzuki Access is powered by a 125cc single-cylinder engine that produces 8.5bhp and 9.8Nm of torque. This engine is mated to a CVT gearbox. The Access gets telescopic suspension upfront and a swingarm linked monoshock in the rear. The brake setup consists of drum brakes all around.",Suzuki
After 1 year we should spend small money for this vehicle because then we can ride easily and comfortably but its front wheel guard is very poor poor quality because of that we need to change it in within 6 months.,Suzuki
After 2 to 3 days I observed oil leakage when I put on Side stand.i observed no leakage when put on center stand.i went to service center and they rectified problem.,Suzuki
"After 2 years everything turned out horrible. I have to service for every 2 months for proper functioning, the oil dries soon, much brake sound, and engine sound is terrible. Mileage giving just 25 now.",Suzuki
"After 2nd service from apple auto, bangalore. I found the change in sound and ideling problem, hence i went back to apple auto service station by wasting my half of the day. They did some tuning and given me. Now that was my bad time . Scooter was giving me only 30 kpl milage. I tested again and again there was only 30 kpl milage. Again i approach to manager of apple auto, he asked to senoir engg.",Suzuki
After 5 months of waiting I bought a Suzuki Access 125 from Advaith Automation. The vehicle is Sky blue colour. I am very happy with the vehicle. It is very comfortable even with a pillion rider. I have done 200 kms and think I it will give a mileage of 40 kms initially and should be giving 50 kms after two or three service. I am very satisfied that I made a good choice of buying the Access eventhough it costed me 50300 on road with minimum accessories. The seat is more elevated than either Activa or Kinetic Sym Flyte and the brakes are extremely good.,Suzuki
After I buy this scooter after that I am facing problem in engine so I go to company service center and tell them about problem of access they promise that they will solve my problem. after 15-20 days of service and replace some parts I am facing same problem of engine and starting problem.,Suzuki
After I get the delivery will update the review with my first hand experience on fuel consumption and comfort.,Suzuki
"After I gone through the mouthshut, I have decided to go for Suzuki access 125. I like the futures in it compared to Activa basides Activa's full market hold.",Suzuki
"After a Long and Long time research(since August 10 ) for my first vehicle.i shortlisted Aviator for its Looks and Comfort, , Access for 125cc , Milage and Storage , and Wego its style and features.",Suzuki
"After a long time suspense on purchasing a scooter as to all the choices I got (Access, Activa, Flyte, Rodeo, Duro, ), I finally decided to go for Access 125 at last.I have taken this for my comfort of travelling with 2laptops & some stuff related to my work n needy.      Oh my God!!!! Do you believe it or not I awaited for nearly around 60 days for my vehicle to my choice (Access-Blue) of colour. Alright atlast I got into my hands im happy for it. Of all the survey I made between some set of scooters, Access is a bit different one compared to all in everything.",Suzuki
"After a long wait I got the vehicle on October 2010, so did'nt like to argue or fight further, let god will handle them.",Suzuki
"After a year of use, I am really a satisfied customer. The ride of this scooter is unimaginable. It can race through traffic with ease. The pick up is so good that,  you hardly find anyone following you at least for 500m, after the signal is green.",Suzuki
After bought this scooter six month its running good but after third service its creating problem. When we drive it stop on road while ridding. two time I just safe in accident when I go for service station for the problem they take my bike for day and after four day they give me my scooter. they told me that your scooters head was failed. I asked them its just a new scooter after six month how its possible? They don't give satisfied answer. after that my scooter was creating problems more and more.,Suzuki
"After changing the Tyre pressure to 19Front and 29Rear, my mileage now measure around 43.5Kms/liter or petrol. But this drop I feel due to the heavy bumper to bumper traffic I am now facing daily in Bangalore. Shall update more on the mileage front once I hit next 1000Kms.. Mileage Update on 15th May 2009 :(truncated this part due to space constraint)",Suzuki
"After explaining everything to my wife and after making her do a test drive we zeroed on Suzuki Access, now the vehicle is 25000 kms driven and used about for 3 years following are my observations",Suzuki
"After free services got over, I made services in nearest local workshops, but it didn't affect my bikes condition. It now gives a mileage of about 47 kmpl as I checked it on Feb, 2016.(i.e 404 kms for 8.5 ltrs). I am extremely satisfied with my bike in all aspects.",Suzuki
"After going thru all ur reviews, I finally decided to get this vechile... after a long wait its been deliverd to me on 06th aug. I finished 1100km so far. Just out of the first service....",Suzuki
"After lot of thinking, browsing & talking with many owners I had zeroed on two brands Honda and Suzuki. Well by Honda name the obvious was Activa and Aviator and Suzuki it was Access 125. Since Activa by and large is not there from couple of years and the only thing that changes time to time as far as I have seen is the asthestics ie sticker etc.",Suzuki
"After my lot of research, I bought Suzuki Access. I made a mistake. I should have gone for Aviator or Activa.",Suzuki
After reading review on mouthshut we have booked one. It is having waiting period of 4 months in surat. To our surprise the vehicle is available freely in the market @ Rs 7000/- premium.,Suzuki
"After reading through all the reviews on this thread and much of a dilemma between choosing Honda Activa and Suz Access, I went for a sparkling Blue access on Aug6.",Suzuki
After riding the new Suzuki Access 125 for last 2 months I am impressed. Yes it's a stylish scooter that attract both men and ladies. I think this bike really suits for men than women because 125cc engine provide higher power and also the seat height is higher(780mm) when compared with another scooters which really effect ladies. The mileage of my scooter is 50 km/hr which is not really bad. Its really fun riding in the traffic and city because of its power(8.7ps @7000rpm). The seating position is really cool and is very comfortable especially someone having a good height. The breaks does not give the confidence to ride faster but still its having a good road grip. I met with few accidents so. the brakes really matters. Its also having a good storage space. The seat length is very good which makes it a perfect family scooter.,Suzuki
"After sales service - The service center(M.D.Motors, Krishna Nagar, Delhi) is shoddy and dirty. However the vehicle servicing as such is OK.",Suzuki
After sales service is the most important part of any automobile product and suzuki fails miserably in this field.,Suzuki
"After say, using for six months the vehicle drags in the initial start up and the throttle also becomes sticky.",Suzuki
"After so many months of anticipation, waiting and speculation I finally got the bike yesterday. Though I made the payment a week ago I got it at my hand yesterday only. An excellent piece of ENGG a well built body and excellent looks. I was comparing it with an ACTIVA I felt it looks like a GIANT in front of him. Mileage yet unknown but there is a bit of starting problem, I am trying to restrict the speed within 40 but at times in busy lanes if the speed goes 2 low the engine stops frequently. Don't know why? Is it some thing to do with the battery or NEW engine.",Suzuki
After that I took it to its 1st service but the problems never vanished and thus I was forced to sell it.,Suzuki
"After that main suffering started. Vehicle using continue started then then good but you switch off the engine then it will not gone start soon.i shown local machanic nearby cause you can not find authorised service centre every where.he some how check out and start the vehicle in hour or 2. Again vehicle running 2/3 days casually cause I don't travel daily or longer distance.but when I travel same issue occurred likewise.in 9th month I finally shown to 4 th service time to service centre and explain them every thing I'm suffering with they given me estimate of around 16'000+ GST INR saying that your vehicle ECM is Short costing 5900, Total body need to change costing 4500, oil leakage from engine head, engine moutain bush need to change, front break pad thread gone etc.",Suzuki
"After the introduction of Zeus and the Heat motorcycles, Suzuki came out with a new scooter in the Indian market; Suzuki Access 125cc. The vehicle is braced with air-cooled and a four-stroke engine that has a CVT (Continuous Variable Transmission). The scooter features a typical Japanese design with the indicators studded on the apron. On the whole the vehicle has made attempts to draw similarities from Honda Activa in terms of ergonomics, styling and the design.",Suzuki
After use of around 1 1/2 years I started facing problem of engine shut down while the scooters is running.,Suzuki
After using a one year I want to share my opinion of this bike with you,Suzuki
"After using my Kintetic Y2K for good 8 years it was time to move on. Not that it is bad in mileage used to get 40-50/liter still, but wanted a more powerful scooter. So being price, mileage and reliability conscious started to zero on a gear less vehicle (obvious that wanted even my wife to use the same).",Suzuki
"After using the scooter for about seven months now, I must say that this is the best two wheeler after the Bajaj Wind 125 that I was using previously. The scooter handles much better than even many of the 100 – 125 CC motor cycles. Handling is superb even at speeds of 80 Kmph. I have ridden Activa which gets nervous after 50 Kmph. The pickup is too good and very useful in city as well as on the highways for overtaking. The suspension is a bit on the firmer side but that should be due to harder settings for better handling and road grip of the vehicle, and therefore is not a major issue. The mileage I get is between 46 to 48 KMPL which I feel is too good for a scooter. The seat is bit taller compared to most scooters and therefore is very comfortable for a six foot three inch person like me. The service center performs fairly well with the kind of volume they are handling. Many a times, I leave my car behind and take my scooter to office, just to feel the pleasure of riding it and I have to face a complaint from my wife that she never gets to ride it ;-)  Only problem I face is that compared to Honda which has three dealerships in different parts of Thiruvananthapuram and several authorized outlets, Suzuki has just one service center and no authorized outlets. Due to the increasing sales (mostly due to customer reference) appointment needs to be taken almost a week in advance, and due to the distance from my house, I have to take leave from my office for a day to give the vehicle for service (Honda service center is just a kilometer and a half away from my house where as Suzuki is around 8, and that too, I have to pass through one of the busiest areas in Thiruvananthapuram). Other than this, I am completely satisfied with the purchase and would definitely recommend the vehicle to all. Only request to Suzuki is to start more dealerships / service centers",Suzuki
"After using this bike for an year, I started encountering too much trouble in terms of maintenance. The electric start hardly started working for me in the mornings, I started getting used to kick start. I am really mad, how they have designed and positioned the exhaust system for this bike. Its hard to use this bike during rainy season, as the placement position is very low for rain water to enter and create trouble.",Suzuki
"After waiting for 3 months as we have one branch only in Mysore, I took delivery of my suzuki Access 125 scooter from the dealer.Right from the booking my experience with dealer was very positive.I got the colour I wanted[grey] and all documents except R.C book, expected from RTO in 3 months.]",Suzuki
Again I went to showroom that mechanics said that sir may be battery problem so its not start but should be start by kick.,Suzuki
"Again at 7 th paid service i told them about battery problem but they told me to replace the same by paying money. I have replaced my battery & found, my vehicle is not charging the battery. That means, there was a problem of vehicle which was not identified by shiv auto riders. They are interested in changing the oil only. They are not doing serving & making only money. Company has to take serious action such type of service stations & warn them to take care of customers.",Suzuki
"Again back with my mileage update after 1600+ kms. I got a worst mileage some days back a pathetic 41Kms. I pondered and thought about the routes I need to take to office etc etc. Finally I decided to give a check of my Tyre pressure since I had checked it < 10 days back. You know to my surprise the front pressure was about 5 points more (normal is 18psi) and back by around 12 (normal is around 26-28 psi for single rider). All along I was having a little bounce but my thinking did not go on the culprit , Tyre pressure.",Suzuki
"Again this rainy season water entered the gear box and noise comes from the gear box. The mechanics keep replacing bearings but the noise persists.I am spending money, but nothing happens.u can go with other honda activa.thank you.",Suzuki
Airfilter is right above the rear tyre. And it sucks dust and water.,Suzuki
"Airfilter is right above the rear tyre. And it sucks dust and water. realiability is also one of the major facilities not like good travels. its bike handling and controling is also not good because its not control in mud area, or in a village area this bike is not control and slept . its bike are not also good look and attractive.",Suzuki
"All free service & paid service completed by authorized company service show room,",Suzuki
All other scooters are limited to only a 100 or a 110 cc and think they dont require more.,Suzuki
"All the switches such as Horn, starter, Light are easily accessible from handle",Suzuki
All these problems which I faced I don't appeal that it is a best scooter.,Suzuki
"All we are known the road conditions are not much good of cities and in such road conditions if you are travelling and suddenly you see the drain or hump the vehicle do not viable to its way and hold the grip of road even if you are late to apply for break. I have gone through these kinds of instants many times in Bangalore roads and its traffic but never taken away from bike, thanks a ton to my bike. I mean it is very comfort and safety vehicle.",Suzuki
All we know that now a days all are living in the towns for the best and the better living of times so I forecely says that you have some of works in the towns for long and long times.So usage of the suzuki bike is very betterand the perfect solution for the life time efforts in your life if its avoided that is your badluck simply all can say that at the time when comes to mileage issue only it is the better way of giving super mileage performance at the same time comforts of the bike is super marvellous at the same time when comes to the reliability thebike is only thebest for ever and ever.grip of the bike is some what low when compares with others at the same time u can appeal at any time if any happens in your life time efforts,Suzuki
All we know that the world is changing and every thing is changing,Suzuki
Almost a difference of 20 KMPL exists when compared to the standard specification of the company. It is a major disappointing factor with this bike for those who expected a great efficiency.,Suzuki
Almost all of these problems have a simple solution and I hope everybody gets to enjoy this vehicle just as much as I do:),Suzuki
"Also 2500/- was an additional cost taken by the showroom guys for steel guard+ teflon coating, though the steel guard is required the teflon coating is tough to make out.",Suzuki
Also for maintaining activa u need to soend extra than access,Suzuki
Also if we go in high speed its speed getting slow automatically  it has many problem engine sound too loud and also have poor mileage vibrating and shuffling while driving it has several problems in rainy season like it slips many time on road while using brakes and if your thinking to buy then please change ur mind its a very maintainence scooter.,Suzuki
Also milege is very bad on the long route it gives only 40 km per liter which is too less.,Suzuki
Also some new colour schemes and suzuki made the 2017 access compliant with emission IV norms with headlamp always on feature.,Suzuki
Also some other things. Suzuki access 125 is the best scooty.,Suzuki
Also the average is good for few days but after that it also falls down so I would not recommend or suggest any one to buy this scooty.,Suzuki
Also the seats are thin and hnce it is not comfortable. Handling is also poor. Cheap plastic parts are used and hence it is also not reliable.,Suzuki
Also the shutter key has a one push central lock system. There’s also a cubby hole next to the choke knob which is deep enough to hold a 1-litre water bottle. Mobile charger is an optional extra and is located next to the cubby hole unlike the under seat option as in rival scooters.,Suzuki
"Also the speed is nice and noise of running is not there fuel consumption is 50km/litre,it is comfortable to seat for 2 persons but 3 persons can reduce pickup speed and reduce the actual performance look is good I really like Metallic Gold color It is Technical, Economically Feasible, Handling and Controlling is too much easy and all the parts are too much confortably designed",Suzuki
Also this scooter delivers great mileage of 55 kmph in the busy city rush even though it is a 125cc vehicle.,Suzuki
Also we get regular service check calls from the company and people at the showroom are really helpful even after we have bought this scooter.,Suzuki
"Also, I think scooter starts vibrating a bit on the front when front brakes are applied with force.",Suzuki
"Also, engine is little stiff as vibrations are felt when reaching upto 50kmph.",Suzuki
"Also, major design change came when Access gave it a retro look which many people loved.Overall very well built and good looking design.",Suzuki
"Although I must mention it's a bit noisy. I personally feel that Activa is smoother then access 125 but considering all other factors, Access 125 would be the best deal.",Suzuki
"Although one can argue that I ain't a smooth driver all times, I am not that wacky as well. So I am very upset on this aspect of the vehicle and I am going to sort other means to improve it, since the guys at the service center are not doing much for it. I great aspect I have noticed off late are the 'brakes' of the bike. Its simply great enough. Not entirely but you can compare it to that of a 'disk brakes system'. I simply love it, serves very handy for congested traffic.",Suzuki
Although the comfort and handling was good but its not that good that I avoid all other major faults.,Suzuki
"Although there is a room for change on couple of things. First is battery and second is pass light. Since it is BS4 the headlight is always in'ON' state. Sometimes it takes time to start the bike. About pass light the problem currently is, it has switch for upper and deeper, and you have to press and release the deeper multiple times for pass light effect. A button dedicated for pass light would be helpful.",Suzuki
"Always complaints, perfomance is too bad, engine problem started within 9 months of purchase.spares quality are not at all good. mileage is very poor, only 30 - 35 kmp.ladies footage uncomfortable. its not usefull for ladies, starting problem even in summer.engine stops in between traffic. worst showrooms and costomer service.i purchased this scooter for my wife, but she drive only two times this scooter, she dont like this.please dont buy this scootter, no value for money",Suzuki
Always going to service center but no use. Plz slove my problem. What to do with this vehicle. It stops while running.,Suzuki
Am happy with this vehicle.its handling is also very smooth and good,Suzuki
Am making up my mind between Access 125(though the way itz printed looks like Flccess) and Activa. But now am tilting towards Access and the reasons from my amateur perspective I shall give you:,Suzuki
"Am really planning to dispose this bike and look for a motor bike for better mileage keeping in mind the ever increasing price of petrol.  Would request your kind feedback on which bike to go for now. ( am looking for good mileage, easy maintenance)",Suzuki
Am satisfaide the scooter .comeny are provaided in 64milege but am chenq.to only 56 milege .but good pulling systam .,Suzuki
Amazing bike it is. I like this bike so Much.the performance of this bike is impressive. This bike gives you super milege.,Suzuki
Amazing experience to riding this scooter looks awesome.When I was buying this I am in trouble between activa and access but when I take a test drive my hole doubt are clear.It also have a comfortable leg space.And this bike have a awesome mate finishing.,Suzuki
Amazing pickup and mileage and its petrol doesn't waste like others and,Suzuki
Among these 3 scooters I have to choose so I have to check all the details of diesel scooter show one by one I will tell you about what are the facts which you have to think about buying a scooter because if you are buying a scooter it will be with you for at least 5 years so you have to think at least for 5 hours to make a better decision,Suzuki
"And  standard variant in  crome mirror are look fantastic, guys this access 125 have top speed up tp 90km its my  personally experience.",Suzuki
And I service every month after then this bike is too bad for me to I telling everybody this bike is compared to jupiter worst bike ever.,Suzuki
And I was shocked to see a response from a service mAnasultanger “We haven’t touched it at all while servicing and we can do  anything to help you ”  He was insisting but all useless answers were provided instead of helping him.( I have his Bike Reg Number with me),Suzuki
And I was shocked to see a response from a service mAnasultanger “We haven’t touched it at all while servicing and we can do anything to help you ” He was insisting but all useless answers were provided instead of helping him.( I have his Bike Reg Number with me),Suzuki
And after using this scooter for around a year I have to get the piston changed I have many other scooters also none of their engine has been opened till now.,Suzuki
And all the worked done in RIA Suzuki (authorized dealer of Suzuki Motors in Mulund) except one. I have copy of bill also if anybody wants to refer. So pls guy think twice before you go for it.,Suzuki
And finally it was a pretty good for a 125cc scooter and also a good range for all especially for ladies to drive,Suzuki
And for milage we can travel to any where without any pain when compared to other bikes we can balance and this bike capacity is good while driving I am not getting any back pain seat is so smooth and width of the seat is sufficient for every person I liked this bike I am happy with this,Suzuki
And has engine type of 4 cycle single cylinder .and has a great road grip.,Suzuki
"And have a great cmfort level , I am an employee , I do daily up down 35kms and its not feel so tough.",Suzuki
And his speed is so much good  82 /km ph other than any scooter because its 125CC,Suzuki
And if u were in cold areas then you have to face more problem regarding its starting .its engine gets off aftersome time if you does not accelerate it,Suzuki
"And if you still wait, in April another 10% of the road tax in KA will be added up. For that I am pretty sure this vehicle will be very costly...",Suzuki
And it gives a good mileage nd its speed is also awsum I personally have opened 105 top speed on this scooty with this scooty u can travel too long and u will not get any prblm in this scooty its maintainence is also very low    its handling is also good you can easily control this scoty,Suzuki
And it has huge space for luggage so you can use this bike for heavy works nice comfortable.,Suzuki
And it is easily damageable bike and it has not resold in the market again because of lite weight and sensitive model of the bike. So I will not suggest any to buy it,Suzuki
"And its air filter asssembly very low quality.air filter damagic while driving.suzuki want to improove the accessory quality,and spare parts.its mileage is a middlege.and rear shock not comfortable. the shap of suzuki access like good. so dear suzuki coustommers please attention to these problems.",Suzuki
And looks of the scooty is too stylish. and it looks very nice.,Suzuki
And my dad unfortunately hurried up to buy this scooter as it was 5-10k cheaper Also,Suzuki
And name access is in bold alphabets looking very good the 3D style,Suzuki
And now a days new models are coming we can buy that by leaving this acess 125,Suzuki
And now lets talk about the reviews of this scooter in terms of mileage it gives me to 50-55 kmpl,Suzuki
And now the safety part. The Braking. Quite amazing. The vehicle did not skid but just came to a smooth halt.. Some of the things I do not like about the vehicle. The average. Just above 40 kmpl.The leg space.,Suzuki
"And now your ordeal begins, spares are not available locally. Even dealers don't have the spares. In Hyderabad no dealer stocked the front mudguard.The dealer should place the order and the spares will be dispatched whenever the people at suzuki motorcycles are free from other things.  It will definitely take a month. Imagine the ordeal, if some thing nasty happens to your scooter. You will be left helpless and will be at the mercy of Suzuki motorcycles India. I went through all this. Even after 1 and half month my scooter is not repaired and it is lying at the workshop.",Suzuki
"And service in Salem is also very good. This and Honda Activa are the best scooters available in the market today.. according to my experience, Activa is slightly heavier than this...",Suzuki
And suzuki doesn't give out any of it major mechanical running components..its not available anywhere else than the showroom.,Suzuki
And the body of access is of fiber so I accident happen hole body will break and te cost of body is high.,Suzuki
And the cost of this bike is very less and reasonable cost compared to its features,Suzuki
"And the last drawback which I found was its fiber plastic body is not a good fit for those who may frequently drive in a pot holed, patchy and rough roads, where huge pot holes as big as 7-9 inches in depth can appear all of a sudden right in the middle of the road.",Suzuki
And the prize is also afordable by common people with all new facillities and the new model and sucessfull rating by people.,Suzuki
And the worst part is the braking. There is no grip in the tyres . Very afraid to ride this scooters in highways .when apply breaks it always slipped. very very chance to have an accident.and I never trust its engine I never recomnd this scooter to any one,Suzuki
"And then with same price its having more power and more milege and the main thing out of 10 scooties on the road, 9 activa and 1 access and I dont like being on boring side, as people gets bored of watching same thing on the road also I heard some problem with kick starting or activa in the morning, I dont know if its true or not but access oh man...i have HH CBZ Extreme, and I love my bike but today when I drove access oh man, its so smooth, so comfortable, I just loved it man. And the main thing its not just a ladies scooty, even guys like us would love to drive it. It's a unisex scooty made by Suzuki.",Suzuki
"And there balanced & grip is awosem, you can easily balanced your bike in high speed like 60km/h.",Suzuki
"And they never ever give warranty to battery, that’s why I will not recommend this scooty to anyone.",Suzuki
And this difference I liked n I boought new access bike few weeks ago,Suzuki
"And those who want to buy a bike , they can buy suzuki access125 , because it is an nice bike.",Suzuki
"And to mention my bike tyre got completely eroded within 20, 000 kms mark. In general normal tyres last for atleast 30, 000 to 40, 000 kms. If  you ask them about it they say the same old story ""parts life depend on the driver of the bike"". My bikes clutch plates gone by 10th service. If you ask for the life-time of new parts they would say slokas like ""we cannot assure the life time of our parts, but our parts are 100% genuine. """,Suzuki
"And todays all indian mopeds sell on highpric, activa's price is 60'000 with an accesery and this is not give a milage like access and suzuki give us a power full engine with good milage in a middle class person's budget.",Suzuki
And very bad habbit of ignition becoz so many time bettert has been low if we not use bike even if we use than also while in riding it get stop engin that its doesn't start than have to start with kick,Suzuki
And very bad habit of ignition problem.when battery is down.it doesnt start.you have to kick again and again,Suzuki
"And very good suspension Front telescopic, coil spring, oil damped",Suzuki
And we can drive freely Road grip big weels milage is super condition long Seat in bike we can seat comfortable its a very goid bike in other bikes now we all are taking that bike only so its a very good condition bike and we can go 2 long drive with comfortable in long we can seat 3 / 4 person in long also,Suzuki
And when it comes to Comfortability its best compared to other Vehicals the seat is wide enough to sit for two persons.And wide leg space where we can carry a 20 lts of an water Bottle.,Suzuki
"And yes they also give the first 8 servicings free, at least at the Bhopal service centre.",Suzuki
"Another great thing about this moped is the comfortable and big seat for the best level of comfort even for long drives.it also has a small pocket near the leg space to put small stuff and 2 hanger clips by your legs, which honestly is great when you have more stuff to carry.",Suzuki
Another guy told me one day That is the best looking Access 125 I have ever seen.,Suzuki
Another helpful feature is that the dickey opening and the engine ignition are operated from the same slot. So its counter clockwise to open the dickey and clockwise to start the scooter.,Suzuki
"Another important factor is that I never had to take my scooter to a mechanic for any engine problems.Periodic service maintains the condition of the engine.Once I had to change the battery and that's all.Model of the scooter is pretty much good.Aluminum covered silencer is great.About the road grip, the tyres used is very efficient and I changed back tyres 2 times in 4 years and the front tyre remains the same.",Suzuki
Another incident happen while I given my moped for change the rear axle . After changing this when I go to pickup my moped . I seen scratches on my vehicle. I asked for the same to the manager( Mr Mithilesh) initially he not agree but after he seen CCTV Footage then he was agree this happen from there employees & he will give me change of this part after 8 days . After 8 days he was on leave & later on he left the organizatizon . And still I not getting solution on this issue.,Suzuki
Another issue is that Airport Suzuki is not that much organized hence you do not get a proper and immediate response. I have requested it's general manager to take some proactive steps and will have wait and see.,Suzuki
Another loophole is its less comfort provided due to cranky body seat design which is not upto the standard of a suzuki two wheeler.Its body style is not at all aerodynamic.,Suzuki
"Another thing that I din't mention earlier was that since the body is not metal, you get only 50% insurance cover unlike Activa's which has a full insurance cover because of it's metalic body.",Suzuki
"Another thing that I read after having run the scooter for 1900 km, you need to take the bike through all sorts of rides before 1600 km to have it run in properly. this means that you can and should throttle her up and down and not just ride at minimum throttle( I was afraid to go above 40 for first 1000 km)",Suzuki
"Any body having any clue regarding problems experinced by me, please do revert so that I can be better equipped when my scooter is due for first service.",Suzuki
"Any vehicle, whether it’s a Mercedes, or Ferrari or a truck WILL break down if you ride the clutch or the brake.",Suzuki
Anybody would be able to answer my two questions posted on 17/03? I just wanted to know if I am doing that alone or some one is with me.,Suzuki
Apart from all this I personally feel that this moped can handel all the rough roads and potholes on the indian streets with still giving a smooth ride and very less jerks to the user.,Suzuki
"Apart from its functionality if we see the bike has a classy look and perfectly selected accessories. Like ( mirrors, the body figured and the seat) and it has a plus ponit that haveing a metal body.",Suzuki
"Apart from mileage, I would have loved to have improved sit . While driving i somehow feel the sit is not that comfortable for a driver (I would give 8/10 points in terms of comfort). But probably, this is just my view point and others may not agree .",Suzuki
Apart from that everything is great about the bike and the highlight is Mileage and Road Grip.,Suzuki
"Apart from this(Rs51, 080) I had to pay Rs150 as commission to the salesman.",Suzuki
"Appeal - As it has high maintainence and old featurea present in it , it looks like an old fashioned and outdated scooty on the road . Looks ugly too in compare with other bikes of this range .",Suzuki
Appeal - I love my old model than this new one. Perfect moto scooter.,Suzuki
Appeal of this bike has a nice beautiful looks and very well finished fiber body with attractive colours.,Suzuki
"Appeal, it has a good looks and very well finished fibre body with attractive colours.",Suzuki
"Appeal, it has a nice beautiful looks and very well finished fibre body with attractive color.",Suzuki
"Appeal: - After release of this bike, the sale went sky up. Many of my friends still prefer this bike and even in city like pune every now and then you will see this bike with someone. So overall this bike has a great mass appeal in people's mind. Its good to have a bike in city and even in small towns.",Suzuki
Appeal: - I would definately recommend it to everyone who is looking for mid range scooter with minimal price and good specs.,Suzuki
"Appeal: Gracious looks,Handsome design. Available in different colors,you can choose your color from a variety of color options both glossy finish and matte finish are available.",Suzuki
Appeal: It is very good and nice appeal of product. Any type of products are not matched this one. It is a great appeal. It is actually appeal at 2000 model.,Suzuki
"Appeal: The style and look of this bike is very good, company offer 12+ colours although blue and white are most attractive and best selling colour.",Suzuki
Appealing-All new design is appealing one. with chrome on front headlight.,Suzuki
Appearance - It does not look very'stylish' like Yamaha ray but I use the term'cute' to describe its look. Most people would like access more than Activa.,Suzuki
"Approached Aryan Suzuki to help make the suspension better, they said that its the maximum limit .Just bought this bike from aryan Suzuki about a month back . If you have kids sitting in front, There is no space to put your foot after school bags are kept. The back stand is so flimsy .I went over a bump and the indicator buzzer went bust . The suspension works only when 2 to 3 people are sitting on the bike. Not suitable for single riding especially if you are above 40 yrs of age. There is no extended carrier at the back like a scooty if your child is sitting with a bag it hangs down putting pressure on their backs especially if bags are heavy. I have been using scooty and activa, never had issues like this. Access needs to be made more family friendly .The end of the footboard needs to be wider to accommodate kids bags and both kids legs and rider.",Suzuki
"Areas of improvement Customer Service & Spares Availability, The icing on the cake, unable to report poor service to the company due poor Website.",Suzuki
As I am driving this scooter from 6 years I know that this scooter will not decrease its own value in the peoples.,Suzuki
"As I am owning this scooter for more than 3 years I can judge this vehicle very correctly. The fuel consumption rate is good but it has not the best mileage, the mileage is around 40kms/litre. The comfort with access 125 is so satisfactory, you can go on a limited long ride without any back pain problem as the seating of the scooter is very much awesome designed. This scooter can be greatly controlled even with a high speed of 60-70 km/hr but above that it is said to be not that much controlled. Looks wise I would rate suzuki access 125 as 5 out of 5. It looks so Awesome. For long life running performance of vehicle I would suggest that it should be make sure  on the road in a week for small trip atleast. Servicing to the scooter must be done, as indicted per every some specific kms without fail.",Suzuki
"As I appreciated the bike with my above heading "" It is really a value for money."" I will elaborate on it why I said so.",Suzuki
As I bought a car in March 2009 and have been using that too. But  Access is still going great and better than before. I love my Access 125.,Suzuki
"As I go through the Internet reference, till 4 th service there is only oil change charges for the bike. But from my experience",Suzuki
"As I have mentioned in the title, I consider access as a scooter with the characteristics of pulsar. Traditionally we used to drive the 100 cc bikes. But in the last 10 years, people  are  willing to buy more powerful bikes to experience sporty and racy driving( at least a 125 cc bike) .These bikes are bought not simply for transportation bu for driving pleasure too.",Suzuki
As I mentioned in the title this bike has awesome pickup because of its 125cc power full engine so if you are buying this dont give se ound option for any other scooter because it is awesome.and having very very good pickup guys you dont beleve this scooter.,Suzuki
"As I provided feedback for some of the folks reviews here, I am happy with the vehicle but see there are few issues too. They are as below:",Suzuki
As I recently purchased this so I am not able to tell in deep but my experience to ride this bike is as:,Suzuki
"As I wanted to buy a Scooter this time, so that it could be used by my Spouse, I had gone through specification of all available scooters in Market & found Suzuki Access 125 is a front runner with best specification.",Suzuki
"As I'm using this scooter since last 4-5 month and I can say that this is a good scooter as compared to others scooters available in market at same price i.e 61000. Talking about mileage so it has good mileage and moreover it have large sitting and storing space. It has charger point and pocket to keep your phone. As it has 125cc engine it gives better pickup as compared to other scooters. It has front wheel which is bigger than the back wheel , stunning design, comfortable to use and value for money. So if you are looking for a good scooter go for it without any doubt",Suzuki
As a seller they should provide all the notifications to customers. This is first and foremost thing they should consider.,Suzuki
As a user of Access for the past 3-4 yrs I have personally reached it to the speed of 85 Km pH considering its top speed to be 91 Km pH.,Suzuki
As compare to other scooters .this one has a unique concept of drawing.the new access have more powere and more feature then the others.,Suzuki
As compared to grip it doesn't have much grip and skates a lot which is dangerous. the road and also the tyre grip is not that comfortable.,Suzuki
"As expected, the numbers are excellent. 60kmph comes up in a quick 7.11s and top speed is 93.4kmph. I also really like the fact that the Suzuki doesn’t struggle going flat out. It is a refined engine and holds its own even on steady 90kmph cruise which it was not designed to do, let’s be honest. Economy’s great as well. We got 48.1kmpl on our city cycle and 58.5kmpl on the highway which rounds out to 50.7kmpl overall.Ride and handling",Suzuki
"As far as the mileage is concerned, it is very lovely. It runs for 60 kilometres per litre. I have to fill fuel for once in a week. The engine efficiency is beautiful.",Suzuki
"As im driving it since few days, it has been very comfortable in riding, u can easily ride 60kmph in a 5-10 sec time hassle free. Since it is new engine I have'nt tried above 65kmph.",Suzuki
"As it is as scooter, it comes with automatic transmission system.Access 125 is equipped other specs such as telescopic susupension in front wheels.The brakes are of drum type.some new features are added to the vehicle such as maintenance free battery and tubeless tyre and colour option.",Suzuki
As many says Service centers Issues has been faced by lot of them and thats true as well& low on looks too compared to latest scooties.,Suzuki
"As my Access has clocked 15750+ kms, I would like to share my experiences which might be helpful to you.",Suzuki
As my personal experience as I have bought access 125 around two months ago and what I discovered was very dissatisfying as it is giving me mileage of just 45-50kmpl as my expectations were about 55-60 kmpl promised by company.,Suzuki
As per the Company standards they stated that it gives a good mileage of 50 - 60 KMPL whereas it is just giving 40 KMPL.,Suzuki
"As promised by the dealers that the this scooter gives 64 kilometers per liter, but is not so. Even on highways it gives around 50 kilometers per liter. My friend bought this scooter and I have used it quite a times.",Suzuki
"As promised updating the mileage that I am getting after the first service. During the pre first service it returned a mileage in the range of 45-50.. Now after running almost 900 Kms, I am getting a mileage of 50-52 easily. My mileage check is Full Tank to Full Tank ( not the auto stop in bunk.. really tank full). Will update with my mileage updates may be after next 500-1000 kms.",Suzuki
"As someone has pointed out just before me, every rainy season it gives a problem.",Suzuki
As soon as you drive the vehicle you feel that the drive is a rough one and the vehicle drives with hiccups off and on.I think suzuki are way behind the honda in terms of service and customer satisfaction.,Suzuki
"As soon as you set off on the new Access 125, it becomes apparent that Suzuki preferred to focus on making this scooter ride better than simply look outstanding. It’s the first time the company has used a 12-inch wheel up front and if you thought the previous Access was flawless, which it pretty much was, this one’s an even smoother customer. The suspension doesn’t throw you off when you hit sharp bumps and is much more pliant and comfortable than the current competition. Wheelbase has increased by 15mm and this coupled with the 12-incher up front make for a very stable ride on the highway, while a good chassis and turning radius maintaining an agile nature that you would want in the city",Suzuki

As suzuki produces good products this new access is also a ok ok product,Suzuki
As talking about space you can keep your helmet as milege 50 55 kmph  an fuel tank 5.6 liter comfort is to good.,Suzuki
"As the name says, it has 125CC capacity which can take good load and can ride smoothly on rough surfaces.",Suzuki
"As there are many brands of scooters in India challenging about there power and performance of scooters under 125cc segments, But the Suzuki Access 125 gives a surprising output as the company claim's it is. With having its 125cc gaint powerful motors which delivers great mileage, it also comforts with its long seats & space under the seats. Only things can be termed for Suzuki Access 125 that KAM PENE K SAATH COMFORT BHI DEETA HAI.",Suzuki
As there were no service center to repair the bike.Also parts of this bike are not available outside the service centers. Again this rainy season water entered the gear box and noise comes from the gear box.,Suzuki
As we all know in this time vehicle is a basic need for all of us. There are plenty of options availaible in the market for us to purchase a scooter. Access 125 launched a new version recently which I think is not as hit as the last one. The performance is same as the last one but the looks which is the most important thing totally disappoints viewers compared to other versions. In this price there are plenty of diffrent better availaible options to go for. So as per my opinion the first thing that attracts a personare looks which are not that great.,Suzuki
As we all know that this scooter suzuki access 125 revolutionsed the automotive industry by giving a cool mileage,Suzuki
"As you all know suzuki is higly trustworthy brand and famous its new product acess 125 highly amazing its pickup is hihgly good and almost more than any other bike I ever found that is the quality of suzuki but its highly poor in case of milege its dissaponit me a lot in this point except milege its good in everything weather comfortable, space griiped on road and look. all facility is available like other bikes this is highly tough comparable honda activa 3g and more fast its look sporty and gripped on road is also good in case of long jouney you can trust on it it is made for long jouney with in less time so I suggest to get this one",Suzuki
"As you know this is 125 cc bike, so with mileage its also provide very good power. with the help of its power its easy to ride with 2-3 people.",Suzuki
As you see the title this scooty is very uncomfortable as I drive it . Its acclerater is very tight so need much power to increase speed. When you drive about 30 min your hand will be start paining .,Suzuki
"At Last I got my first vehicle and  joined in Access Family on Feb 14.Since I am not intrested on Extra accessories and Permaent  Registration, my vehicle cost is 51, 250.Other wise it will be 54 change.i got Metallic grey Color.",Suzuki
"At Rs 1850 per installation which includes the tire, tubeless valve and fitment, these are not cheap compared to the Rs 1000 odd for the MRF Tires. But I think my life is more valuable and it is worth the price for the superb control and ride quality it gives me.",Suzuki
"At a claimed 64kmpl fuel economy, expect fuel consumption to be in the high 40s or even 50kmpl in the real world.",Suzuki
At first I thought this occurs only for some vehicles. But many customers started complaining about the same issue.,Suzuki
"At last I believe this is a masculine two wheeler which can be used by boys, girls or senior citizens due to its low weight, high mileage, good looks and less price.",Suzuki
At last I would recommend this to buy instead of activa 125 or activa 4g.,Suzuki
At last I would suggest to thing about other scooty because you can get better opint in same price thanku very much .,Suzuki
At last i'll say that I am not recommending to those who wants good mileage and good comfort zone.,Suzuki
"At one time almost all scooter were calmly settled at the 110cc, 8bhp mark.",Suzuki
At starting the bike is very good but after some days I have not liked this bike. The mileage of this bike is very less.When fuel will be over in the bike we turn on the choke it will not come for 2 km also.,Suzuki
"At the same time, many customers are boasting how they got the vehicle within 15 days.",Suzuki
"At the time of booking, the dealer assured that, the delivery will be made within 25 days.",Suzuki
"At the time of delivery - you find no accessories fitted, forget accessories, no seat cover, no handle sleeve, no foot mat,  You ask them - they tell you that the price has gone up- and when you paid the balance amount we did not order for accessories - We have in our mind the price we spoke on day 1 - but then he says the price has been revised.",Suzuki
Authorized service --- generally ok and no complaints till now,Suzuki
"Available in many colours, I have my own in red colour. Having 6 litre fuel tank capacity is enough for me. Daily I used to visit my farm which is located 20 km away from my house. Worth to buy this scooty I am also planning to buy one more for my brother.",Suzuki
"Average of 45km/l on this petrol when driving very aggressively in pune traffic, (braking and accelerating hard). Will continue to check.",Suzuki
Aviator is also a 100 cc model with disc brake( pricey and looks like old wine in new bottle). Why pay more for looks and disc brake when power remains the same.,Suzuki
"Aviator uses the same old engine, the one in Active. Access has a brand new, high performance engine.",Suzuki
"Awesome scooter, quite comfortable. Milage around 58 kmpl in chennai roads. Nice and smooth engine. Smart pickup and Great acceleration. Moves as you think in traffics with a slight rise of throttle. Over takes almost every vehicle in front with no effort. Good brakes. Sturdy vehicle. Proud to have Suzuki access 125. Thanks to Suzuki.",Suzuki

BE CARE FUL WHEN YOU BUY ACESS 125 - GET AN OFFICIAL QUOTATION,Suzuki
BOUGHT SUZUKI ACCESS 125 ON 04/01/2010. MAIN DEALER5 SUZUKI DEALER OF CHINSURAH-HOOGHLY-WEST BENGAL. SUB DEALER- VISHNU AUTO -BHADRAKALI-HOOGHLY.,Suzuki
"BUT IT IS A GOOD SCOOTER. ITS LOOK IS SO GOOD. THE PRICE IS STARTING FROM 57, 200.",Suzuki
Back rail yet modify front disc break can be considered handle be more wider for better stability straight pass indicator and dim light may be opted for safety body plastic is so thin can be better digital speedometer may be added feature tubeless tyre is essential as no stepney is provided.,Suzuki
Back seat is very high size.so below height persons doesnot like it.so I said that the ok scooty.,Suzuki
"Basically the commuters and specially the scooters are normally boring but the Suzuki Access 125 is not that one. This scooter is not going to win any award in terms of its looks and this is not a sporty looking either but it features good looks although and it's a perfect family scooter. This is impressively quick scooter and the performance is great by the standards of its class and the mileage is also reasonable. The handling is good and the ride quality is great in this scooter. So, all in all this is a solid and complete 125cc scooter.",Suzuki
Basically while riding in a city it gives around 40-45 Kmpl but while on highway it can touch the 50kmpl mark.,Suzuki
Battery is placed under the foot rest. thus dirt and water easily goes upto battery particularly in rainy days thus making the battery wire to corrode easily. underseat storage and refueling requires to rotate the ignition key in anticlock direction. this appears to be a good thing but actually it makes things worse. repeated use of ignition hole make the connections of ignition loose and then you have to push the key clockwise harder and harder to start the scooter. After sometimes this stops working and then whole ignition assembly has to be reworked.,Suzuki
"Because I once made a big dash into a pot hole by following behind a bus near Lakkasandra and the second time near Jayadeva in BTM layout, and these were before the first service, then when I went to the service after a month, the mechanic there showed me a slight crack which had appeared in the shield of the scooter just above the front wheel cover, though not noticeable to the eye, it can be felt with the finger.",Suzuki
Because of comfort level. Its seems like there are no sark up in scooter.,Suzuki
Been using the previous model for the past approximately 6 to 7 years.loved it that I went for the new model when it was time. smooth engine.smooth pick up and not as heavy as any other vehicles in the market. various colours available for different people. i'd suggest go for a black one to know the actual product design and c'mon black just gives it very classy appearance that anybody would love.,Suzuki
Before 2 year I bought new Suzuki Access black color scooter for my father. I heard about this scooter from my friends that its good scooter of 125 cc. My friend also work in  Chita Suzuki's workshop so I bought this scooter.,Suzuki
"Before a 9 months? I bought Suzuki access 125 which price is round about 55, 000. When I bought a this your company tell mileage about 50 to 55 kmpl . In beginning it was running at mileage 45 to 50 kmpl but since three month it give hardly 35 to 40 kmpl . When I told this problem to your service center they told me to do one full service. So as per they told I do extra service to solve this problem but I couldn't not get sufficient solution of this problem. So Ultimately? your customer care staff and service center staff is not supporting me . Ultimately your suzuki access 125 is not user friendly for customers and not preferable for mileage. And I will told my friend not to purchase this two wheeler.",Suzuki
Before buying I had read in MS that some people had problem during rain. Last week there was a flash rain in Bangalore which lead to over filling of roads. Please read comments section as the system says > 7500 chars,Suzuki
Before the first service it gives an average of 45 kmpl but after the first service it gives an average of 28 kmpl.,Suzuki
"Before the purchase of this vehicle, I owned a TVS Streak. So coming from a comparatively low powered scooter like that, you can definitely feel the upgrade in riding experience. The Suzuki Access is a 125cc scooter which I feel is best in class.Positives: 1. The pickup on this scooter is very good. Easy to climb up slopes.2. The throttle is very responsive. It's not required to rev a lot to reached economy speeds.3. Headlights are pretty decent for city traffic.4. A loud horn allowing you to warn traffic of your presence.5. Light handle giving you more control over the vehicle.6. Extra long seat gives you and a pillion rider ample amount of space to sit.Negatives: 1. The suspension makes noises when you go over bumps.2. No switch to toggle the headlights on and/or off.3. Fuel indicator has been observed to show wrong information at some points. Example: I had more than half tank of petrol and it warned me of low fuel.4. Shorter riders may find it a little less accesible. 5. Turning radius isn't upto the mark",Suzuki
"Being a 125cc engine, it almost never feels strained even while sitting at its top whack of around 90kmph for extended periods.",Suzuki
"Being a compact vehicle it gives each and every thing which can the expected format it. Acceleration is a superb, which also gives its uniqueness.It can give competition to each and every bike in the market with its acceleration and control which makes it even more lovable and not only that it also consumes much less fuel than many other vehicles of same range or of same kind.",Suzuki
"Being an engineer myself I usually put a lot of thought process in the gadgets that I get, same the case here.Now for any one who is in a dilemma between activa or access I hope my input will help you.",Suzuki
"Besides that now im riding the scooty and now its more smoother and improved in terms of milege I feel. I feel after the first service it will improve a lot. So other than those topics which I mentioned above I dont have any problem with this scooty its a champ in scooty market trust me. in the market u always win the race caz of its superb pick up against activa, tvs, aviator, kinetic and even on short journey against some 125cc bikes too.",Suzuki
"Besides this, it is available in eight different colors in the market. The available colors are Glass Sparkle Black, Candy Sonoma Red, Pearl Suzuki Deep Blue, Pearl Mirage White, Metallic Fibroin Grey, Matte Black, White and Metallic Sonic Silver.",Suzuki
Best compliment for the scooter would be when someone in the car lowering the glass and asking about the scooter and which I have experienced many a time in Mumbai traffic.,Suzuki
"Best part is, it is very light weighted and also looks good. It is also good mileage is around 40-45 KMPL. But there is cons for the same. as it is light weighted it is very easy to meet with an accident when driven in speed. Also I found the radius of the tyre really lower as compare to other scooty. Self balancing is also missing in this bike",Suzuki
"Best scooter in India, much better than rival activa and other brands available in India in all aspects, . An intelligent effort of Suzuki highlights in this new access125. RIDING COMFORT is excellent. Looks different from all types of scooters in India. acceleration of this scooter ranks top among all rivals.An international standard product for Indians from suzuki.",Suzuki
"Best thing about this vehicle is it's pick up. Hence, when you stop vehicle during signal, and when you want to start it again when the signal turns green, it takes just 1 second, for the vehicle to get a good amount of push. (remember, it's a 125 cc scooter and not 110 cc)",Suzuki
Best to do it was a new year and comfort of the best for the best for the best for the best way of my mom said he said you know how much as you have a few days to the first thing I am looking forward to do not the best for the best for the best.,Suzuki
Best vehicle till now.the best class in milleage and superb pickup from 0 to 70 in just 8 seconds.talking about looks the vehicle in superb and aerodynamic too.superb space in front as well as cabin is superb too.the vehicle engine is too much powerfull too.and best in class average the vehicles fits everything,Suzuki
Bick averegeis 50km par 1liter this ok from access bick. On road averege is 45km par liter. Long draiv given averege is 50km par liter. Bick methel is faibar I dont like this methel. bick is sef.,Suzuki
"Big headlamp in the front should make your evening ride a safe one and the tail lamps were most beautifully shaped; which should make the owners quite proud of them.  The pillion footrests, made a lovely click, click sound when they were opened and had a very distinctive appearance.  I was told that these were among the items, which were imported directly for this vehicle.  Overall fit and finish of the vehicle was very tight and good which really made you feel you were driving a very fast imported scooter rather than one of domestic origin.",Suzuki
Biggest issues in the gearless bikes is the mileage. But I found in this bike that the good driving skills increases very much of the mileage. Roughly this bike gives you the mileage of 40 KM/LTR but I found 50 KM/LTR with me. So the Thumbs Up For mileage.,Suzuki
Bike has great milege and best for long drive.Bike is very popular in people.The height of bike is also upgraded by componey.It is my favourite in bikes. Most aatracting thing of boke is that its colour and look.Every one loves these qualities of bike. Best thing I love that is service provided by suzuki they very well maintain their bikes.,Suzuki
Bike is Comfortless because of its seat and height it cannot drives by a tiny people,Suzuki
Bike is a very good but only one service center in bhubaneswar. The behavior of the service center professionals is horrible. Also the mechanics are not knowledgeable and they do not provide good service.,Suzuki
"Bike is good everything is good about it company is trusted nothing is bad about it average is good decent looks. Suzuki is brand that is trusted by many so no need to tell about it, if you want a bike that is stylish as well as reliable than this bike is made for you. Go and grab your one. This is my first time that I am reviewing this so it won't be exact but this bike has got everything that you need in your future bike",Suzuki
Boot space is amazing and a helmet is easily accomodated. however I just found out the there is a clever hook under the seat that can keep the helmet locked to the scooter .(Read the manual),Suzuki
Both Access 125 and Swish 125 are currently sold in the market and the Special Edition was available for a limited period.,Suzuki
Both breaking are combined and it's called of Combi brake system so it's also good picture provided by Suzuki it has mobile charging USB port in Idukki it is also good think ok you can charge your mobile anything no need to stop in your you have if you have to you feel petrol then no need to open diggy cause feel feeling soccer Tej fitted outside its speedometer is unlock its speedometer is not digital but odometer it digital and trip metre is also digital you can check your petrol the capacity by metre so overall my experience about this bike in 2 years is very good it comes with kick start and self start both options are available it is automatic transmission in scooter there is no gears.,Suzuki
"Both have similar engines but the Rodeo has more features and is cheaper than the Suzuki by approximately Rs 4000. However the Access has some small positives like power, torque and dimensions. I feel that the Rodeo's plastic and the build quality is not as good as Access. Mahindra showroom is nearer (1.5km) as compared to Suzuki (17km).",Suzuki
"Both the wheels of this scooter are 12 inch and the total weight of this scooter is 102 kilograms and the fuel tank of this scooter is 6 liters. which us fine and you will get this scooter in at least 3 colors such as red, black, and blue and as far as i'm concerned this scooter road grip.",Suzuki
Bought Suzuki Access 125 in Oct 2017. And have given it for first service now.,Suzuki
"Bought Suzuki access 125 as honda activa had a long waiting period.I took a test ride od acess, found it very stable with good pick up and enough power.",Suzuki
"Bought suzuki access 125 mid sized scooty on my 21st birthday from suzuki showroom. It gives better fuel mileage and great pick up. Stylish and shiny look with 124 cc, electric start and 4 stroke engine. The perfect design of seat provide comfortness during ride. Hence my riding capacity being increased.",Suzuki
Bought the Acess from Jayanagar showroom in 2010 and still it runs perfectly smooth. The bike didnt give much of a problem only sometimes the brakes get stuck and the shock absorbers also create a little problem.,Suzuki
Bought the vehicle 2 weeks before(drum version).Suzuki has successful now in crushing activa series with the aid of this scooter.Here are my views about the scooter,Suzuki
"Bought the vehicle from umang motors delhi, the mileage till now is good even after 40000 km's, but the spare parts are tooooo expensive and can only be bought from the authorised service centers which everyone know how much margin is kept, the spares are unaccessible even from the market in karol bagh delhi, which is considered the biggest mkt for spares, now it has started giving lots of problems the mechanic suggests to sell it off as its pressure goes of every now and then, no local mechanic can repair it, most of them dont even know how to open it",Suzuki
Bought this beauty last year and I am very satisfied with it. I own glossy blue colour and it looks amazing. It has long seat which helps if your are big size guy. The cushion is soft and comfortable and then is ample of space of keeping things beneath the seat. If you're a tall guy then no worries as it has good amount of leg space. The pick up is nice and being 125 CC engine it runs at good speed.,Suzuki
"Bought this in anticipation of great quality, value and economy associated with the Japanese brand Suzuki. However, didn't turn out to be a very satisfactory experience. Following are some observations:",Suzuki
"Bought this in the year 2011, the bike was very good while it was new.The pick was good, the average was good, the handling, engine etc everything in the was good. But with in one years problems started with the bike.",Suzuki
"Bought this scooter 6 months back, main reason was looks. 3 break downs so far. compressor problem, spark switch problem, starting problem. I had to push the brank new access 3 times so far, so I a dont trust this vehicle. My activa which is 9 years old, is still going strong. I regret the decision to go for suzuki access just for the looks. The height of the seating is a bit higher compared to activa, so that makes a little uncomfortable for seating. Go for activa, that is more reliable",Suzuki
"Bought this vehicle for city use.It is used shared by me and my dad.In the past 2 years the vehicle is giving lots of problems and is slightly turning unreliable.It requires servicing every 2000kms or else it will frequently off on deacceleration. The rear wheel rubber belt cracked into pieces while riding the vehicle making me to push it the the nearest service center for 2 kms, luckily if this problem would have taken place far off it would have to be towed straight away after which I avoid taking it to rural areas.",Suzuki
"Brakes - initially very low but after a few thousand kilometres are adequate to stop in emergencies. But I generally feel that for the scooters power , the brake should have been much better",Suzuki
Brakes are really bad.the vehicle is skiding when we apply brakes on 50 Kmph.,Suzuki
"Brakes fail when they overheat. They overheat when they are continuously braking while driving. If you continue to drive this way, and supposing you need to emergency brake, you will crash.",Suzuki
"Braking distance reduced by half: These tires are much better whether you are riding on a clean road, or a muddy road or a wet road.",Suzuki
"Braking is pretty bad, skidding, intial noise.fibre finishing maximum .rear looks .silencer finishing is looks like away from scooter .",Suzuki
"Brand - suzuki model access 125 price 61, 900 launch date 03/14/2016 body style scooter displacement 124 cc engine type 4 cycle single cylinder air cooled 50 hc 2 valve maximum power 8.58 bhp@ 7000 rmp maxumum toque 10.2 nm@ 5000 rmp bore 52. 5 mm stroke 57.4 mm ignition cdi etc this is not good for all and price is so hige",Suzuki
Break - This is not really good in Suzuki access. This troubles even at 40 KMPH. You have to apply both the brakes still it won't be under the control. It little skids and you have to balance a lot to stop it. Not sure if this is bug but servicing people said they are fine.,Suzuki
"Build quality is pretty good, it is having a fiber body kinda plastic but it lasts for about 6-7 years the positive side is that it is having a fiber body and a 125 cubic engine which is pretty good .",Suzuki
Build quality is very bad this bike. I can say quality check is not done proprly. when front wheel into small pit holes or small hump makes noisy and they have side black colour breeding's for body and it will come out soon. beetween this days experience I am sharing.,Suzuki
"Bullshit review. I am driving this scooter since last 3 months, and it has never stopped.. Probably you should take class of driving scooter. Also, your dealer gave you bad service does not mean all dealers in the country will treat all customers the same way.",Suzuki
But As it have 125 CC Engine but it doesnot have that much power as compare to Honda Active. For First Fews It is better but after some days it starts making problem .,Suzuki
But I am still disappointing because of very poor quality of material utilizing in to the scooter for example when my scooter fall down on the stand so all accessory and head light are broken down and after purchasing this scooter I have to repair the wiring of light around three times in six months.,Suzuki
But I asked in manual it's showing 63km per letter after one month 1 services I asked service enginear but what he's telling no this bike gives only 35km per letter.,Suzuki
"But I used kick 2-3 days and then after 4th day I used self start in the morning, it started smoothly, and so on for next days. Now there is no start problem at all.",Suzuki
But I was wrong when I drived other scooty then I got to know that this scooty is little bit hard to handle .,Suzuki
But access has the best bodyweight and super milage and confident ride. I am not getting 48km/L milage.,Suzuki
But after marriage... I need to think of a vechile which wd be of help to me and my spouse. I dont want to describe much abt it coz I find it to be true wat all the reviews that I read. But wd like to thank u all and mouth shut.com... in helping me to choose this No problem bike. An am a happy customer. Color I own is flint grey..,Suzuki
"But being a 125cc engine, it almost never feels strained even while sitting at its top whack of around 90kmph for extended periods. The CVT unit is new and clearly, emphasis has been given to bottom-end performance for ease of use in traffic. The ride quality is stiff and again, surprising as the older model managed this aspect rather well. The front telescopic suspension has good low-speed damping qualities where small undulations on the road aren't felt but jerks on the handlebar go up progressively as speeds increase.",Suzuki
But for others out there who need more power and great mileage this is the one to buy.,Suzuki
"But hear ye, Fools!  whoever reads these threads wants to know the truth. Writing the reviews for this bike based on some random ready advertisement data is useless.",Suzuki
"But i was happy now to know that there was some recommended to change the spark plug, air filter and oil filters. Now my scooter is again back on track.",Suzuki
"But if you compromise in this , suzuki Acess 125c is a good scooter.",Suzuki
But if your looking for performance than better buy Access125 don't even think of buying any other crap scooties that have just good looks. I assume Access have only one rival that is Activa. I can only advice to suzuki that its braking needs to be improve on Access125 as this vehicle is beast of all scooters at this range!:-),Suzuki
"But it have also very high pickup in scooter range comfort is just amazing, so it is very reliable while driving it have no vibrations and sound in high pickup it may sound.",Suzuki
"But it was a brain driven decision, not a heart driven one, hence it took some time to convince the heart. I was very happy with Trigger's performance, there were surely some issues, but the pleasure a bike gives you, nothing can replace it. I test drove Suzuki Access 2016 around March and immediately knew that it was a contender, but with the anticipations of PCX, Zir, SR150 made me wait, wait for something that will be a perfect marriage between practicality of a scooter and performance of a motorcycle. So, the wait eventually ended when Aprilia launched the SR150, and that too at mouthwatering price. I went ahead booked one on paytm, without even seeing it in person! Long story short, when the demo vehicles came down to the showrooms, I test drove it and found the SR150 to be short on space, all around, the seat and under seat storage and finally leg room. The other issue I had with SR150 was the stiff suspension, I know its race set, but for my usage it was not suitable. So had to say goodbye to my booking amount on paytm and forget about the SR150, hard decision, but had no choice. With no announcements from Honda about PCX150 and Hero about Zir, it was all new Suzuki Access 125 then!",Suzuki
"But its major problem is its road grip, the road grip of this two wheeler is not good which will lead to many bad things happen on the road. The causes of poor road grip is, the poor quality of wheels. Due to poor quality of wheels this rider is not able to have a good road grip.",Suzuki
But mileage is just normal in city test conditions. Mobile charges proves a good advantage. Its well suited  for our tough roads. Well its good to ride it. It is slightly overprices I feel. Could be better if prices.,Suzuki
"But more then this, what I have felt most is that they give warranty of 2 years but in that there is condition to get all services done by them and oils to be changed by them only as and when they say. Normally they dont follow prescribed schedule of service book and ask customers that it has to be changed.",Suzuki
But my bike geving only 25 to 30 again he done some tuning he told me sir ur bike geving 32km he told me sir u shoud do 3 service after this well give after 3rd service also its giving 25 to 30 only .don't by anyone this bike,Suzuki
"But none has a solution to it. I repent buying Access, total waste of money.",Suzuki
But now the updated suzuki access 125 is build with all new design and its crome headlamps look cool also the suzuki now produced all new engine and it states that its a SEP i.e Suzuki Eco Performance which increases milage along its power.,Suzuki
But only negative aspect is about the brakes even if you apply both the brakes it will take at least 2 to 5 seconds to stop. Which may create problem at times.,Suzuki
But overall a good scooter and probably the best in the market as of now.,Suzuki
But the only problem is it stops suddenly while driving( even if there is enough fuel) .,Suzuki
But the other Scooter like activa has digital display. The mileage of access is more better than the active. The seat is bigger than the another scooters. I like the design of the access. I stay in Hyderabad the Suzuki service center not available as mush as honda hero. I prefer u to set back brake as disk brake. The sound from the scooter is much more than the another scooters. I would u to buy access it is much more comfortable than another one,Suzuki
"But then this is no surprise as the engine is a 125 cc as compared to 102 of Activa prima facie, which may though be compensated by higher weight of Access 109 Kgs as compared to 104 Kgs of Activa. Riding position was much more ergonomical and comfortable then Activa but purely from my physical characteristic point of view and hence may differ from individual to individual. Braking was spot on and didn’t have any spongy feeling like Activa. Front forks are pretty smooth and may better Activa in typical Indian condition which has potholes and craters. I managed to drive it intentionally at low speeds through potholes and it was pretty impressive as it didn’t bottom out as was the case with Activa.",Suzuki
"But they are not interested in solving the problem . So for the first year it was great without any problem , but from 2nd year onwards it started giving problem of Low mileage ( Even on Highways) , accelerator problems , engine noise & worst was start-up problems in bright sunny days(Forget the winter even in Mumbai climate) . every time the service center ( MRP-Dombivali Mumbai )  took additional charges ( as its out of warranty ) & informed that we have set the things now ..it will work fine . But the problem resurfaces after 8-10 days .",Suzuki
But today I faced problem in my scooter is eat the oil (oil khay 6) & my scooter 37000k. I am runned. Completed,Suzuki
"But we need to make an important statement that all of the comparison scooters had made entry into the market at the right time.The all new Suzuki Access 125 REALLY is brand new, almost every bit from chassis to design and engine to improved torque. Suzuki has always brought noticeable difference in every new launch. They surely have understood the like minds of Indian customers. Taking this as an advantage their very new product Access 125 has given the right product by appearance.",Suzuki
"But what is really nifty is the fact that the scooter now comes with a couple of handy features like the ignition slot doubling up as a boot release, a useful front pocket, and even a mobile charging socket available as an add-on. Switchgear and fit and finish levels are good and on par with the rest in the business.",Suzuki
But when you have about 70km/hr which it easily does it is a smooth sailing,Suzuki
But why my scooter is eat oil please cleared in this short time?,Suzuki
But with this one suzuki should come up great and evan have come up great as compared to past.,Suzuki
Buy this only if u love the design and style but not for mileage.,Suzuki
Buying this scooty was loss of money and there is no perfect milege some give perfectly and some does not give full milege,Suzuki
COLD starting is a Big problem in this Bike as it does not start at all in winters.,Suzuki
CONS 1. the fists drawbacks is its height. I have a average 5.9 height but sometimes I feel problem with its height. 2. and the second drawback is its breaks. emergency breaks sometimes risky just because of its ground clearance.,Suzuki
"Candy Antares is available in five attractive colors: Red(19A), Glass Bright Black(YVB), Metallic Sonic Silver(YD8), Pearl Mirage White(YPA), Metallic Matte Fibroin Gray(PGZ).",Suzuki
"Cannot comment on aviator. I have never driven one. Thought it looked too guardy for a scooter. Access to me is simple, professional and sweet. I respect Honda, but anyways, I am really happy about the decision I made on going ahead with my daily friend ""ACCESS"".",Suzuki
Cant belive the mileage has improved... its giving 56kmpl now... its used to be 48 earlier. and Handling is so easy...u feel as if ur on wings. initially I had no intention of buying this...coz I never like scooter.,Suzuki
Center Stand It is extremely  difficult to put the vehicle on center stand. It is impossible for ladies. Suzuki should have addressed this issue given that it is also used by ladies.,Suzuki
"Center stand and kicker knobs are so close to each other that if u want to use kicker to start ur bike u have to put center stand and start ur bike using kicker , remove the stand and then ride the bike. Crap design . consider for girls and old persons who are riding in a busy roads. every time we cannot trust the battery self starter to get start the bike..",Suzuki
"Central stand, side stand, silencer pipes etc. are showing signs of sever corrosion and rust.",Suzuki
"Chassis Type is High Rigidity Under Bone, Suspension Front: Telescopic, Suspension Rear: Swing Arm.",Suzuki
Clutch not designed for Indian city driving conditions where one can not exceed 30-40km at any time,Suzuki
"Combi brake system, alloy wheel, handle bar with control switches gives easy handling and control over riding",Suzuki
Comes with almost all necessary accessories at the Sale price.,Suzuki
Comes with one push control lock system. You can rely on this product. Value for money and good on road performance.,Suzuki
"Comfort - In the name of comfort it is worthless and very annoying in riding and passenger too , you feel back pain and shoulder pain after some time of riding wit it .",Suzuki
Comfort - it's comfort level is just because of it' model not give such comfortable.,Suzuki
Comfort - seating arrangements are perfect and fit ride the bike freely without out any stress and feeling bad.,Suzuki
Comfort - the driving position is great especially if one sits upright and can cover long distances without much fatigue.,Suzuki
Comfort -It is very comfort to ride as seat is long and they provide more space under seat to store things as compared to activa.,Suzuki
Comfort ability is as usual not very well as we expect and if we talking about Handling and its controls its also need improvements actually you cant feel batter in traffic with this one scooter.,Suzuki
"Comfort and handling: Good, Driving position is designed to give a confident and light feel.Perfectly aligned seating and handle bar heights for a long drive, excellent handling in city traffic.",Suzuki
Comfort it has good shock obserbers so that you can drive comfortably even in dirty roads .,Suzuki
"Comfort level is as usual in all mopeds.But suzuki could have manufactured it more compatible, more reliable.",Suzuki
Comfort of the bike I found very low. Because I was getting tired in the sitting while driving the bike. Also here it might can be reason that Roadgrip of the bike is average but the stability of the bike is very low so you loose your comfort. This situation goes worst when someone sits behind one sided.,Suzuki
"Comfort, it has a good shock obserbers so that you can drive comfortably even in dirty",Suzuki
"Comfort, it has a nice shock obserbers so that you can drive comfortably even in dirty roads and it has huge space for luggage so you can use this bike for heavy works very comfortably.",Suzuki
"Comfort- If we see it's comfort it is ok but not good as other companies like Hero and Honda, But yes you will feel good while riding.",Suzuki
Comfort-the comfort level was average because of small tyres and tight seat.,Suzuki
Comfort: - Suzuki scooty is far more comfortable than other scooties I tried with a large leg space and wide seat.,Suzuki
"Comfort: - This bike weighs around 110-115 kg which is less than other mopeds. This makes diving very comfortable and even the seats give comfort as they are such designed that sitting on it for even long drive, no stress is observed.",Suzuki
Comfort: It has wide comfortable seat with front telescopic suspension and 12 inch front wheel.,Suzuki
"Comfort: Smooth to ride, one doesn't feel the weight and easy to control",Suzuki
"Comfort: Suzuki bike wonderful look and best comfort of riding. In this having design very luck colors. In this suzuki access 125 is not gear system. So, students and ladies are can use efficiently. This bike gives high speed making very comfortable for the riders.",Suzuki
Comfort: Yes this scooty is comfortable but no much comfortable as compared to Maestro and Activa but you will feel good when you are riding this scooty.,Suzuki
"Comfort: this is very comfortable bike, it has huge seat, where people can sit easily and enjoy the ride. It has great space where you can store your goods. It provide good space for legs, so need to fold your legs as its a long bike in this segment.",Suzuki
"Comfortable, although the seat is a bit high. I'm 5'8"" and there are times occassionally when I've struggled just a little bit to station both my feet on the ground. The steering is narrow and compact than Activa and I feel better control of the vehicle when I grip the steering compared to Activa. The suspension is much better than any other vehicle in its class. The scooter glides through minor bumps on the road.",Suzuki
Comin to looks access scores again & is a stunner in my book.Activa well not so good as the looks are outdated.,Suzuki
"Coming to drawbacks the handling of this Scooty as it falls down at sharp cut. And about maintenance and service,   before first service I have got 50 kmpl but after first service I got 22 kmple and while going on single vehicle will be getting off I have shown d vehicle on Suzuki service center but they didn't clear till date I am facing same problem but they are not telling permanent solution and service is very bad I was asking in showroom solve the problem but they didn't taking any action. this bike looks good for above 40 years.",Suzuki
"Coming to the bike, it is very good looking and has very less fuel consumption comparing to other scooties I have used previously.This bike has good comfort and reliability is very good.The difference I found in this bike is the effect of handling this scooty is very easy in handling and most importantly the looks of this scooty is mind blowing. have purchased it in last march stilli don't have any kind of negative impression on it.",Suzuki
"Coming to the drawbacks, one of the major ones were its lesser road grip due to its design or whatever kind of dynamics, because when I give a little more acceleration in roads/patches which had light slush or garbage littered the rear wheels just turn like crazy but the vehicle is just in the same place, lesser break power, bcoz at some point of time I was forced to brake down suddenly at high speeds in some places in Hosur road due to careless bus drivers, there I found the scooter backside skids sideways till the rear brake lever is released slowly.",Suzuki
"Coming to the mileage, the company says it will gives around 60kmpl but in reality it",Suzuki
Coming to the pickup as u know the access stands for a great pickup its pickup is awsome than you think.You will feel flying on it.,Suzuki
Coming to the point of pick up & acceleration well our bunny is 125cc & it surely lives upto this & gets ahead of activa.More power & guys wont feel awkward as thin is heavy & verty sturdy.,Suzuki
"Coming to the ride and handling, the Access felt more stable than most other scooters owing primarily to the slightly higher weight and the longer wheelbase. The front end was well weighted and aided by the telescopic suspension, handling was very stable and confidence-inspiring. It wasn't exactly plush but on state roads it felt comfortable. Many people claim that the pickup is bad. When I rode it, I realized that the gearing is different than Honda scooters so while it doesn't take off from a standstill, the midrange and top end is really strong. I rode the Access extensively in Goa for thee days and I could happily cruise at 70 all day. If pushed, it could touch a top speed of 90+ which was excellent and the Access felt stable at those speeds. Brakes were good too, though emergency braking would still need quite a lot of effort and would unsettle the bike. There was sufficient power available at all speeds, quite unlike the 110cc scooters which felt like underpowered after 60kph. The engine was a bit more rough compared to Hondas and the exhaust note was a bit brash. I can say this as the bike which I rented was a relatively new bike with only 6000kms on the odo.",Suzuki
Compairing the scooter available in indian market suzuki access 125 is the best option among all.It comes with disk brakes and with alloy wheel on both tyres.,Suzuki
Company claim 50km/lit average but it gives below 30km/lit in city.,Suzuki
Company claims it gave mileage of 70km but it in actual it gave just 40km IT SERVICES CENTER TOO BAD .They are not even know how to deal with customer they are greedy and always make fool. I am not going too buy more product Suzuki from same showroom neither I will recommending to my local friends.,Suzuki
Company claims it gave mileage of 70km/lt but in actual it gave just 40km/lt. Service center is too bad THEY DONT EVEN KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH CUSTOMERS. They all are greedy and always make other fool.  I am not going to buy any more product of SUZUKI from same showroom. Neither I will recommend to my local friends.,Suzuki
Company shall take a different look in favour of customer and see that service centre people dont behave in monopoly way else there are chances of consumer court come in picture for proper justification against such rule by company. Over all scooter is good but this incident made me loose faith on company's integrity towards customer,Suzuki
"Compared to 10W30, 10W40 is also compatible from -20 to+60 degrees. This is mentioned in the company manual.",Suzuki
"Compared to activa / wego , i decided to go for access because, you can easily make out the difference between driving activa and access. Access gives much more comfortable ride.",Suzuki
Comparing the older version the new access is comfortable with a large seats with good positioning and leg room space .The suzuki provides premium service for every customers which is a good thing.Their where improvement in looks also.New chromium borders give the access a new style and stand out in the crowd.,Suzuki
"Comparing to other scooters available in market, the Suzuki Access 125 is the worst among all. Riding comfort is not so good in city traffics. mileage getting low after service by service. power and pick-up is too high for the scooter. morally the scooter is behaving all way like a motor bike, which is very unfair for a scooter customer. only the color and looks is good but quality of the paint job is very poor. according to me, its absolutely a wrong choice, if you are civilized person, looking for peaceful ride.",Suzuki
"Comparing with Activa/ Aviator or kinetic flyte, suzuki scores high.",Suzuki
"Conclusion is, if you have some extra Influence, then only you will get the scooter. Ordinary Indian citizens have no value with Shiv suzuki.",Suzuki
Cons - Very low mileage ( am getting only 25 kms per litre in spite of getting it serviced),Suzuki
Cons.:It doesn't comes with combi brake or sync brake like activa and Jupitor.I brought 125 and changed 125 SE crome mirror.Looks very cool and better than standard.,Suzuki
Cons: - It needs regular mentainance and body is easily prone to scratches,Suzuki
"Cons: Heavy, hence morning kick starts are tough[especially for my friends of fair sex]",Suzuki
"Considering that the quantity of male shoppers in the moped business sector is few as it seems to be, it required some oomph to work. What's more, tragically it has none. In spite of a capable 125cc motor, the delight of riding is really absent in this. There are likewise the various cases of serviceability issues that have been accounted for. It's made for men however it's not sufficiently macho. Also, it's excessively macho for ladies. Great Trishankhu impact.",Suzuki
Considering the kerala road condition new suzuki access is the most prefered option among all. I love it.??,Suzuki

"Crashing into another vehicle: Bye Bye Scooter, Hospitalization.",Suzuki
"Currently I am getting a mileage in the range between 40-45 kmpl, think this is less because of my improper driving. the pick up is very good when I drove it single, but whenever a pilion is there it is getting a little bit harder.",Suzuki
"Currently I am riding it, though engine sounds like having some more rpm",Suzuki
Currently Suzuki access is top of the moped bike and new model access 125 color quality and many new features implement in the new model.,Suzuki
Currently different from other gearless bike . This have high power and more flexible to drive. There is large space inside seat this helps to leap large items also. The new model access has high power and smoothness it's seat is large compare to other bike this helps to travel more than two person . While discribing about style it's Also amazing .,Suzuki

"Damn, I am vexed up with servicing of this bike. It would be better I buy a car, but I am now in a dilemma whether to buy Maruti SUZUKI car?",Suzuki
Dasbord and contrass colour is very beuty scooter is looking nice and very prity.,Suzuki
Dealer is a cheat will not provide an additional foot mat(which is part of the accessory kit); unless you know about it and ask for it specifically.,Suzuki
Dear all I would say its one of the worst scooter in all respect. because of following reason.,Suzuki
Dear friends never get trapped with some nice reviews about milage or look become the most important part of any vehicle is its Engine and at this point this scooty will make u frustrated in no time. What I have faced is so annoying that I would not like to invest hard earned money of anyone in such worst vehicle. Here one additional star is only for its decent milage of 40 kmpl Thanx,Suzuki
"Dear friends, dint purchase this bike, because it gives very lowest mileage and worst road grip.when compare to other bikes all futures are simply waste.please dint waste u r money by purchasing this waste bike, there are so many good bikes are available in market.",Suzuki
Dears I heard about suzuki access is a bettet bike. After I bought it I undrrstood its not so good because it is not giving us the mileage that company says. Now I feels its not comfortable for drive. Old model is more comfortable than the new model. And its digital speedometer has dead within 6 months. So guys I will say suzuki access 125 new model is not better,Suzuki
"Decent pick up, don't compare it with bikes though. I've loaded the scooter with approx 145 kgs. of passenger weight and the scooter handled it pretty well, especially climbing a 20-30 degree incline of flyovers. Overall, ride quality is very good in the Pune city traffic. I travel 40-45 kms daily and haven't felt really tired manouvering through the Pune traffic.",Suzuki
"Definitely I will be able to recommend if any is about to purchase this,",Suzuki
"Delhi is crowded with traffic these days, no use of buying cars . Buying cars will result you in hours of traffic jam. So the best option is to buy a two wheeler . Suzuki is a great two wheeler provider, so I went to the showroom and looked out for Suzuki Access 125. It has all new and latest features. Access 125 is a excellent vehicle-it's mileage is good, Great engine, fuel consumption is good, looks are great, seats are comfortable for two persons, opening the storage is easy, handling and control look quite easy. Suzuki Access 125 gives me a smooth drive, also on uneven surfaces.One disadvantage is that it is small in size .You should buy this vehicle as it is best for crowded areas and traffic like Delhi and would gift you all a great driving experience.",Suzuki
Design : - Design of the scooty is very good and looks attractive when see.,Suzuki
"Design And Features - One look and it's apparent that the all-new Suzuki Access 125 won't win any beauty contests, and it's not likely to turn too many heads on the street as well. But one thing is certain, the All new Access 125 looks big, and quite handsome. It's cut out in gracious lines rather than being fashionably hip and doesn't make a loud, brash statement.",Suzuki
"Design for male, female, adult, kids and older, Less weight and easy to carry, Less consumption, highest millage, comfortable, stylish, spacious diggi for luggage, durable, easy grip, powerful breaks, no geer, specially design for indian road which has ton of diteches, affordable and worthy Long time investment.",Suzuki
Design of this scooter is quite normal as other scooter little parts of angles are differ from others and features are not same to other scooter.,Suzuki
"Designwise, Access 125 is a very good scooter, better road grip and powerful engine. But the outsourced components are of very poor quality.",Suzuki
"Despite a powerful 125cc engine, the joy of riding is actually missing in this. There are also the numerous examples of serviceability issues that have been reported. It's made for men but it's not macho enough. And it's a little too macho for women. Classic Trishankhu effect.",Suzuki

Discussing its outline its not extremely amazing its a really fundamental plan. The outline is not smooth and fashionablebut rather its calm enormous and unapealing.,Suzuki
Do you think its price should be 63k.after one year its power is greatly reduced,Suzuki
"Does Suzuki Access has better mileage, pick up than Honda Aviator? Whether purchasing Access would be worth ?All your suggestions are most welcome.",Suzuki
"Don't buy access 125, because of starting problem and some issue in engine. Engine stops in traffic many times, very poor mileage , give only 25 - 30 kmp . Engine oil leakage issue, ladies foot rest also not comfortable. Automatic engine off even in summer. When riding two person, then it's pick up go down. After use 1 year it's gives me accelerate problem, which is some time high and slow, this issue is safety purpose not good. I have changed some engine parts during the engine problem. I suggest that go for other brands.",Suzuki
Don't buy this scooty guys. Not a good choice to invest your hard earned money.,Suzuki
Don't know why Suzuki is not marketing it aggresivley? Off late now one can see the advertisement of Access can be seen on TV but not as frequent as the othter players do.,Suzuki
"Don't know why some people telling this scooter is not good and foolishly telling to choose 110 cc segment activa. Trust me first of all I also had same thought as others, that the new access has same issues like old ones and were going to buy Activa 125, but my friend told me test drive the new access at once. So I did and found more power, lightness, comfortable, smoothness. Thanks to him without any further hesitant bought this last year in August and really after 8000 KMS still enjoying and getting 48 to 55 Kmpl in our busy city. There are spammers trying to fool others but I insist people to test drive the access and then choose you like. There are no other scooter in this 125 cc segment like the new access 125.",Suzuki
"Don't you feel the diky gets too hot, need some insulation there. The engine directly under does the trick. You can not keep delicate items. Once I kept a packet of chocolets and imagine what happened to them. even though it was a cool night.",Suzuki
Dont B confused ...........It is actually an aeroplane.............just flying on the Roads..The mileage it gives is about 45-47 now...........& it is not even serviced. A friend of mine told to buy this bike instead of the ACTIVA or DIO..............as it is heavier than DIO lighter than ACTIVA.,Suzuki
Dont always ride fast it is very interesting and thrilling to go fast but someday our body parts may also go same way due to some major accident as a result of over-speeding.,Suzuki
"Dont buy Access 125. It is not safe. pls buy Activa.. Bcoz Access 125 is very light weight and no road grip. if you cross 55km speed, the vehicle is not in your control. Break is total waste but activa breaking is very good.",Suzuki
Down your accelerator and then apply both the brakes simultaneously. Some people tell not to apply front brakes but till today I use both the brakes it has not created any problem and the access can be controlled very well only if you use both the brakes simultaneously.,Suzuki
Driven both Activa( 5 years) and Access LE(6 months) overall kudos to Activa suzuki does n't have engine feel of 125CC and uphill vehicle starts literally crying .,Suzuki
Driving experience is not so reliable and hasn't a Comfort zone.,Suzuki
"Driving is so comfortable, handling superb, seating comfort, smooth riding, I don't know if I missed anything in scooty besides that tuff up tube.",Suzuki
Dt 06/04/10: It has been almost 15 days riding experience with Suzuki Access 125.,Suzuki
"Dt 23/03/10: Ok... at last I have got my access 125 after a 1 month waiting time. I drove the vehicle to home with my wife, my two little angels.. and I felt it very nice ride. the balancing was very good and break, ride comfortable is amazing. I will work out with showroom regarding noise I heard from the vehicle. But other things are great. Let me ride more and then will come back with my total feedback.",Suzuki
Dt 27//04/10: Finally after riding it for 302 KM I have given to 1st so called 'free' servicing. The problems that I have told were 1. vibration of the handle 2. high sound when accelerating 3. kick start does not work properly 4. front indicator gaurd which was pending and 5. idling issue,Suzuki
"Due to its heavy weight, we cannot handle this vehicle when tire goes flat.",Suzuki
"Due to very delay pickup , I personally dont like this bike , and but very good engine 125 cc and but with poor brakes, and mainly its totally uncomfortable for me , it just have a big space under seat , and at point of average or mileage, it is just okay for it.",Suzuki
"During June 2010 I planned to purchase a scooter type vehicle for our family use, after several reviews and comparisons, I booked Suzuki access red color on the same month with delivery of 3 months from date of booking.after a long wait(3 months), I reminded the dealer for vehicle delivery, he said ""it will take another 15 days for the required color and given a choice if you need the vehicle urgently you can go for white or black color"". It was very frustrating at that moment and went to the dealer office, surprisingly on the way to dealer office they unloading the vehicles which I found few red colors also. Then I told him what I saw, he simply says it was for the customers who booked earlier before me. Then with the help of vehicle financier, I gave him Rs.300 bribe to allot the red color, with a smile he allotted immediately!.This is was a total upset at that time.",Suzuki
During booking the talk very nicely once the amount is settled you will be the least priority person.and we need bear abusing words.,Suzuki
"During delivery make sure petrol tank is enough to reach the nearest petrol bunk, as in my case the vechicle ran out of petrol even before travelling 4kms, had to pull the vechile till the petrol bunk.",Suzuki
"During gear oil change, the oil is only slightly silvery colored(inevitable metal powder), when compared to the blackish oil that used to come out earlier.",Suzuki
"During this 1 year , I had 2 occassions where I ran into trouble. One was because of my faulty fuel",Suzuki
"During winters, it takes its own sweet time to get'heated' so that it wont stop at less accelerator(less rpm). Engine is also not problem free. my access 125 started giving out smoke at just 14k on odometer although no hard acceleration, racing, tripling happened and also all services in time. I had to pay Rs 8000 at service center for piston change.(they says we have to change cylinder as well).",Suzuki
Dynamic of the bike is good which helps to provide perfect stability over control.While riding it gives light feel to drive and smooth,Suzuki
"Dynamics are good which helps to provide stability over control. while driving, it gives light feel to drive and smooth.",Suzuki
ENGINE ROUGHNESS: the engine of this scooter is not as smooth or as refined like other scooters in this category like activa and many more.,Suzuki
Easy start system.smoother ride and added protection.the new access 125 is looking so stylish buy it now.,Suzuki
"Economy- It gives the mileage of 55 kmpl when new. but after three years of use, it still gives 40 kmpl.",Suzuki
"Economy: Very good for a scooter, can hold upto 5.5 L of fuel, consistently delivers mileage of 45-50 kmpl in Chennai city traffic and when used in outskirts on a freeway delivers upto 53-55 kmpl(mileage should be calculated on tank fill drive 200 kms again tank fill, Economy= the kms driven /no liters consumed on second fill), do not calculate mileage by filling 1/2 l or 1 litre.",Suzuki
"Economy;- Nice scooter for mileage, scooter can hold upto 5.5 ltr of full, Confidently delivers mileage 48-53 kmpl in Bengaluru city traffic and it delivers rural or byepass 55-58 kmpl. I think this is good mileage in this sector.",Suzuki
Electrical Circuit / wiring has been repaired to get lights and fuel guage working.,Suzuki
"Electrical s Battery is 12 V, 3 Ah, Head Lamp is Powered by Halogen.",Suzuki
"Elimination of vibration and noise: In conjunction with the engine oil and gear oil changes, I am happy to say that there is neither any whirring sound, not any grating vibes as I used to feel earlier. If I leave the handle, the vehicle can go in a straight line even with a pillion rider.",Suzuki
Else pick up is good and scooter is ok. Go for Honda dio or access. Avoid 125 cc vehicles. Check for 5 year guranatee on engine. Insist for 5 year warranty.,Suzuki
Email:- planetsuzukisales@gmail.com). I have purchased Suzuki Access 125 from this Sunshine showroom.,Suzuki
Emergency braking - it should be made complusary for combo brakes also,Suzuki
Endless I have this modle this have smarty look endless fuleing 45 km/l all types of assecories are availiable in market endless breaks endless horn it powerful comfortabilty endless reliabilty endless breaks no large sound produce indigeater are powerfull I servies regularly so it is like aa end point in scootries so all buy the access 125,Suzuki
"Engine Displacement: 124 CC, Brakes on Front: Drum & Power: 8.7 PS @ 7000 Resolution per minute.",Suzuki
"Engine Performance - There are no surprises when you thumb the starter; the engine settles into a reassuring hum and the scooter pulls cleanly, accelerating without any sense of feeling strained or without any vibrations creeping in. The engine is a new one- with SEP technology or Suzuki Eco performance, which reduces friction among the moving parts and is also said to improve fuel economy.",Suzuki

Engine capacity 125cc really shows the power. If you are really a good rider you'll found with in 5 kilometers test. Same happened with me too. It was really good. My all friend who have more then 20 years of experience as rider also observed. Milage is 55 in city ride within 50-70 kph speed(65 kpl at highway as i have tested.). Very smooth after 50+ speed. No vibration . I never used kick till today's date. Space under seat is more then activa and others. Front sinde space is little less then active. I cant put my cilender properly at the front . It adjecet but touch the front of seat.,Suzuki
"Engine is giving a good response with the very good mileage, this is surely a plus plus for Youth as it will attract the youth like college going, even the mid age group people.",Suzuki
Engine is quite powerful and I can easily go uphill with my Hippo friend as pillion. I haven't encountered any maintenance issue till now.,Suzuki
Engine is reliable it seems (not sure since i'm using since 1.5 years only),Suzuki
"Engine is something which most of us worry about while buying any vehicle. But as the historysays Japanese are good at their machine job, one would like to really see how it works, even if the machine doesn't deliver what is expected they get back to their labs to get what they want. The all new SEP engine by Suzuki done for Access has been refined and given to the market gine sounds smooth and it runs smooth too, which make the numbers as follows, at 7000 rpmnew Access 125 produces 8.7ps while the pullingcapacity is 10.2 N-m @ 5000rpm. The displacement is 125cc powered by Suzuki Eco Performance which has increased the fuel efficiency and stability. At an ease Access can reach 75kmph with pillion rider without any vibration on 'highway'. Well the mileage would return in good number in economy mode and style of riding. One can expect 50+ kmpl.",Suzuki
Engine oil is something that should be given personal attention. NEVER entrust the service centres with oil replacement work. I buy Castrol oil for all my vehicles and replace it personally.,Suzuki
"Engine performance is very good, even under speeding it up on 100 km/hr, I have't heard any buzzy sound. The pick up of access is ultimate.In we speak about its fuel economy then it gives an average of 40-45 km/l. Its gives more when you are on a long route, say of 200-250 km, as I have noticed during a regular drive from delhi to agra and then to aligarh route. Gear box is making a noise when you have covered around 12000-15000 km, but its normal as told me by the engine mechanic of suzuki. I am owning a access and its running on its 23k milestone now.",Suzuki
Engine performance is very good. I hvn't heard any buzzy sound it is a good advantage.,Suzuki
"Engine piston problem is there in suzuki access its starts after 1 or 2 year and then continues. Suzuki mechanic will advise you to rebuild your engine which will cost arount 8000 and still they don't take any responsibility, no guarantee warranty is applicable.",Suzuki
Engine seems to be reliable and smooth. Pick up is unmatchable.,Suzuki
Engine shuts off when slowing down or when brakes are applied.,Suzuki
"Enough with the buying process, coming to the actual vehicle, it is everything a family scooter should be, first and foremost its a Suzuki and feels like one, the new SEP engine is smooth, linear in acceleration, has good pick up for a scoot better than the market leaders in this aspect, it has good build quality. And then its convenient with its good under seat storage, best in class foot board, comes with two hooks for your grocery and vegetable runs, has a mobile charger socket(optional).",Suzuki
Enter.  A brand new scooter  which has a blend of characteristics which would suit both the new rider as well as the old.  I was fortunate to sample one at the nearby dealer.,Suzuki
Entha manchi production nanu ekkada chudaladhu vinaladhu its very comfortbull the children its very nice on road it looks very nice its going on the road someones looking to me talk to very good bike its looking softest nice bike in the world its realy good,Suzuki
Even I got it repaired from agency as well. But it started giving problem right after a month.,Suzuki
Even I have experienced such issue once. If you guys have suffered with the same problem share it here.,Suzuki
Even activa give more mileage then this scooty. It is a comfortable bike only. And this bike is poor in reliability.,Suzuki
"Even after all these incident,  they are not responsible and do not even care to respond to the costumer.",Suzuki
"Even if you compare Suzuki showrooms with Hero, Honda, TVS & Yamaha, they are shabby in look and there is no proper knowledged staffs to sell.",Suzuki
Even it was the first 125cc released arround 2007 and it beats all the vehicles in terms of power and pickup.,Suzuki
Even this scooter need lots of petrol and also it battery get down anywhere.Mostly peoples are complianting about it engine.While riding it sound some noise which hate by many people.I wouldn't recommend you this.,Suzuki
"Even though I don't like access so much but still saying that the bike is bad is not justice. So as far I'm concerned this bike is really good in its own way the style isn't a copy of other company's scooter but its unique. I have rode so many versions of access over the years and I can tell that access surely is one of the most powerful scooter in india. Its pickup is amazing no scooter couldn't can reach that level though being a gear less bike access has proven it's strength. Those who bought this bike I told them one thing that don't bother about it's look, look wise it may be little dull but its milage and pickup has no comparison. The new access has a variety of colours like blue white etc. Just like the old bike suzuki has kept their promise for this bike the speed of 2017's is the same of 2010's no doubt about it. Just like all other scooter it has all the facilities you needed, carriage, milage and good road suspension. 40-50 is the milage though suzuki promises 60-70 but the reality is 50's max. I highly go for this bike.try it you wont regret it. For looks I'm giving three stars as its not that attractive as other gear less bikes really are but manageable, for comforts I will give four stars it is comfortable for sure, handling and controls I will give suzuki access 150 three stars it's a good rating though, fuel consumption no doubt four stars because suzuki access 150 is one of the few bikes in india which is fuel efficient. Highly recommended.",Suzuki
"Even though I went through some reviews, as being newly introduced product, I could hardly find any good reviews.",Suzuki
Even though the looks of Suzuki Access 125 is good and It has a stylish appeal. But It doesn't give a good Mileage to the User.,Suzuki
Even when I was purchasing my first scooter I was bit confused in 3 scooters that which scooter I should buy then I have to come back for a lot of time and the result which I got that which scooter should I buy that was Honda Activa heat,Suzuki
Even with a pillion on board it pulls without giving any sense of felling stressed.,Suzuki
"Eventually happen to other colours at the dealer, Red and Black were hot shots.",Suzuki
Every day I use this bike for office and I ride approx 75 km. due to high distance I have selected this high mileage bike. From last 8 months I am using this bike for my office.,Suzuki
Every month it's damages became increased and I became fed up with this bike. Many times I took this bike to showroom and repaired it. But no use and comfortable as well.,Suzuki
"Every now and then, some issue or the other pops up. one fine day engine started making loud noise. I immediately switched it off. after one hour when started again, it started normally as if nothing happened one hour ago. I took it to service station and then simply says its working fine without giving any satisfactory reply as to why loud noise appeared. It is surely a below average scooter.",Suzuki
Every one easily handle this scooter. But it just expensive price.,Suzuki
Every time I face same problem they can't solve my problem permanently.,Suzuki
Everybody is saying that the airfilter design of this scooter is not good.,Suzuki
"Everyone knows Suzuki claims Access 125 gives 65 mileage but how many of you have actually ascertained the fact by putting it to test? Whats the mileage it is giving in city conditions? Think before writing something on the public forum, people are unconsciously praising manufacturers for half-truths and inconsistent data.",Suzuki
Everyone knows about chennai traffic and daily I need to travel 44 kms from tambaram to taramani.so I decided to book gearless suzuki access after lot of reviews and discussion with my friends.,Suzuki
Everyone out there should try this scooter. Guys u gonna love it,Suzuki
"Except for design and color, nothing seems to be as per the production specification. The pick up is okay, and I don't feel the power of 125 CC. The mileage sucks and it's around 30-35, the claims are wrong. The controls are not good, the breaks are not good, and it sometimes stuck which increase the risk of skid. Beside it, the service center experience is one of the big NO NO. The ground clearance is high, so it's not comfortable for short people. Not a reliable product as per my experience and Honda Activa seems to be the good option rather.",Suzuki
"Exceptionally awful experience, I never propose this vehicle extremely helpless mileage and client care and the most serious issue is administration focus there is not many assistance community accessible and neighborhood specialist not even t ouching saying don't have the foggiest idea about this scotty, I'm from telangana and truth be told, not very many assistance place accessible in whole telangana, I solicitation to suzuki organization to expand the assistance place in across state",Suzuki
"Execution astute its alright it gives great mileage and the plate break works consummately. The primary concern I like about it that its entirely roomy at back one can sit easily . In any case, again activa perform path superior to anything suzuki and its cost is likewise less expensive than suzuki.",Suzuki
"FIRST OF ALL DONT GO BY MY TITLE...THE VEHICLE IS JUST PERFECT, and I have already booked it after a TEST DRIVE !",Suzuki
FIRSTLY it is not as good as previous access model because I think the look of previous model is nice and look of this model is little bit overlooped .,Suzuki
Features -They provide 125 cc engine with 2 drip digital meter. and they also provide a feature which indicate about oil change in case you forgot to change on time.,Suzuki
Features also are not great in this range and the scooty also falls short on durability due to plastic used.,Suzuki
"Features and first impression .i was very much excited to ride my new access.its so smooth, stylish, matured and pleasant.",Suzuki
"Feeling worse after buying this, because of service and lethargic customer hawndling at this pin kumbakonam you don't have a proper service center, works carried out in a shabby 12&12 shed, no proper water wash and air filling facility, bills are not proper and replaced parts are not given to us, replacing spares with out our knowledge, worst place to go .",Suzuki
Few days ago we have contacted for simple ignition switch at dealer point and he just said clearly not available with him and when we forced him to contact further then also no proper answer has been given from him.,Suzuki
"Few days back i have purchased suzuki 125 access. What i can say for this scooter, just as if i am in the open air plane. Simply superb.",Suzuki
"Few factors which also suffers are like the filter problems and the odd sounds by the bike . But the major mileage problem disappoints one a lot. Even though after many services, the problem is not solved.",Suzuki
"Final Words Poor Service, nil customer service & non availability of spares at ABT Arumbakkam, chennai hampers Suzuki Access.",Suzuki
Finallly purchased Activa 5G which little bit cheaper and reliable,Suzuki
Finally I am here to review about this suzuki access 125 as I am using this scooty for 4 months.,Suzuki
"Finally I have bought it 4 months back, It is giving me all the things which I was expecting.It has awesome sitting space, no engine noise, smooth riding, hard dripping, nice pick up, cool look and excellent mileage.After my 1st servicing it is giving a mileage of 48kmpl.I am really happy for my decision of buying  it.",Suzuki
"Finally I have recd my nos I decided to go on a long drive, I can just say that its simply very very comfortable(comparing to my PULSAR's comfortness) and performance is superb, while driving on Economy Mode, it seems as if there is no sound from the scooter, simply a smooth ride.",Suzuki
Finally I want to suggest to everyone to try it for test drive first then if you are then you can go with this for purchase.,Suzuki
Finally I will say that this product is good in every thing but its road grip is poor and you can nevery relia on this rider.,Suzuki
"Finally I would like to add its mileage. After running 800 KM in a month, this is what I got",Suzuki
"Finally had option between activa and aviator, as new activa launched so dropped the idea of aviator as I didnt like its look compared to activa.",Suzuki
Finally service: The best part is service from showroom. After each service the feel of ride is amazing,Suzuki
"Finally, I really enjoyed the riding even for long distance.It seems to be my choice is correct. After my recommendation, many of my friends purchased Access and so far no complaints from them.",Suzuki
Find out what our experts have to say about Suzuki Access 125!,Suzuki
First of all Activa 125 or Access 125 was my choice.activa ruled out as waiting period and useless artificial demand from honda which is an insane.other counter parts ruled out.so left out for me is access 125 .,Suzuki
"First of all I am really thankful to Paytm which offers a 4K cashback by paying through Paytm wallet, not only this I also got 1K cashback in insurance after paying insurance amount too via Paytm. Apart from this I also got 1320 Rs corporate discount and a provogue sun glass in complementary offer.",Suzuki
First of all I bought this Bike as It was promised by dealer to be delivered in 15 days as I was badly in need of Bike for commuting and no others delivered bikes in that short time.,Suzuki
First of all I like to thank you to Suzuki community to launch this type of bike.,Suzuki
First of all the ride quality is excellent it is very comfortable the pickup of 125 cc engine is very quick responsive.It also has a storage under the seats which is enough to keep the halmet or some thing like that.,Suzuki
"First of all we talk about the mileage of this scooter, then this scooter has a 125cc engine, which makes a power of 7000rpm on 8.58bhp, so that the scooter gives a very easy mileage of 64 kilometer per liter and a special one. It is also a matter of fact that this scooter picup is more than any other scooter which is a great thing and the design of this scooter will attract you a lot.",Suzuki
"First of all, I want tell you all that I am not sales promoter or from agency of Suzuki access. I am a general public customer. If you are really confused which scooter to buy after reading various reviews in different websites. My advice is choose only one scooter that is new access 125. Yes. It is having great pickup and one will definitely feel riding a car and not driving a scooter. I am access 125 customer for the past 8 years. Person who accustomed to ride with access, will never like any other brand of scooters in India which won't give this much of comfort. It will never skid, never cause back pain, 3 persons can sit comfortably even for long drive. Don't be particular about mileage and resale value of the vehicle. In other scooters, you will fell down on road while skidding, and with backpain you will loose your money for treatment as well as your peace of mind. Considering this, why dont you be particular only on comfort, road grip, pickup which access will give you. It may be giving 40 Kmpl mileage. But it is an excellent scooter with no starting trouble in self start like Honda activa 5G. My advice is only buy access 125 with your hard earned money which is really value for money. I enjoy riding my new access 125 for the past 3 months and didnt find any difficulties so far as I have been a proud customer of Suzuki access for the past 8 years. Pls trust my words and don't waste your money in buying other brand scooters. Take right decision.",Suzuki
"First of all, any repair cost should not be so high. In less than 5k. I will be able buy a second hand TVS Scooty. Secondly, if it is so costly, then its life must be long like 10 to 15 years. I am comparing this with Bajaj Scooters which I used for almost 10 years and never having to replace anything other than clutch wire and brake wires. And Splendor which never required any part to be replaced whatsoever in the 5-6 years that I used it daily.",Suzuki
"First of all, the Suzuki Access 125 looks stylish and sleek. It has a modern design with smooth lines and a shiny finish. The scooter comes in various vibrant colors, making it visually appealing.",Suzuki
First problem is its braking system sometimes it doesn't get balanced when we brake. And the second problem is its mileage. it has very less average of mileage which I hope can be improved by the company,Suzuki
First the front look of Suzuki access  125  is Superb an about indicator its given refresh look of Suzuki access.,Suzuki
"First they told it's mileage became normal after use, but it didn't happen and I spend more money for filling fuel by weekly.",Suzuki
First thing bad thing of suzuki access 125 is very havy sound bike make noisy sound and I despointed for that thing,Suzuki
First thing body - access Suzuki Access 125 is having a plastic body or you can say fibre body but which is not that much rainfall in compared to the Honda Activa show one point goes to Honda Activa,Suzuki
First when they tell you the price- they include all the accessories in it. you get a receipt for Rs.1000/- thats all the document you get from the dealer.,Suzuki
"First, they do not stick to their commitments.-I booked access and I was told by the management that within 2-3 weeks of booking date I should get my vehicle delivered.",Suzuki
Firstly I will tell about their good things and bad things ok,Suzuki
"Firstly about Mileage: In scooters, I think access 125 is one which gives best mileage.",Suzuki
Firstly if u want to start your access with kick you have to satnd ur vehicle on double stand and then start some how it is very difficult for ladies to have thier access on double stand because access is too heavy .and their self start stop working gradually in winters . Engine need to be modified with less kilometres as compare to others .,Suzuki
"Firstly, Talking about Suzuki and how good suzuki has cope up with its 125cc scooter that is Access 125.",Suzuki
Foot board- the foot board is very small and sometimes uncomfortable while carrying luggage. The bag hook is positioned awkwardly and is of no use.,Suzuki
"For girls below 5.5"", who use to sit on extreme edge, it will be very convenient to drive and also in case of boys who use to sit little backside rather than front edge of the seat, it gave same convenience and comfort.",Suzuki
For me what sets this moped apart from the activa 4g and 5g is the power of the vehicle.,Suzuki
"For performance, ride quality and comfort this scooter is superb. In fact it is the best mileage giving scooter in 125 cc segment. I am getting between 46-50 in city drive. Now if we talk about finishing, looks and built quality then the finishing of this scooter is really good. Built quality is not as good as compared to honda activa but better than rest of the scooter in this segment. Now on co ming to the features and styling, it missed some of the main features like engine switch and petrol lid open switch( these should be there in this price range which other scooter in this segment have). Look and design is totally subjective, one may like it very much, others may not. But in my review I like its front profile but rear and side is don't like it at all. I love retro design but the look and design of this scooter is not catchy like vespa in retro design segment. Overall I bought this scooter for overall ride quality and mileage.",Suzuki
For servicing I spent 2000 rs in a year and a battery of rs 1050/ extra. but bike riding gives a good experience.,Suzuki
"For servicing have to give it before 9 am in the morning and will be given back in the noon. So my advise is please give ""access"" for service on time. It may cost around 250 to 500 per service .",Suzuki
"For the 6 months, the tyre grip was fantastic and reliable but after using it for an year, everything started falling up-part and the appeal started fading away.",Suzuki
"For those who are interested in buying these Scooter, should be going to buy an Activa or Jupiter",Suzuki
"For those who are not happy with Honda Active and its sales service and suffer from back pain while raiding other 2 wheelers, Access is very good choice and alternative.",Suzuki
"For those, whose eyes caught up on this one because lookin at it's price, and engine. Or may seem it may be best for you but think it again guys.",Suzuki
Form my expirence I would like to say to buy suzuki access is best bike.,Suzuki
Forrest expirence I had with this frequently gets repair ant the Micheal michinical are not available in the market so better don't prefer to this it is my personal expirence so it is my sincere advice to all how wants to by new one so don't prefer it in case you have this Michele better share ur expirence,Suzuki
"Found access more appealing terms of ergonomics.Then I went to access showroom.To my disappointment, I found that the suzuki guys are not offering a test ride. They were saying that the product is selling good even without an ad. Then I started consulting my friends & read several forums including MouthShut_Official to see which one would suit more for a beginner like me.Also I had to ascend 2-3 inclines before reaching home. So I thought it would be better idea to buy a scooter with more power. So I finally booked the access on sept 3rd'09 from kaimanam suzuki, trivandrum.",Suzuki
"Fourthly, there approach towards providing details of required documents for booking of vehicle.- I had asked to provide the necessary document details and they took 5 days to provide me the details and format of the affidavit required during final settlement. They gave all kinds of unusual and funny excuses and delayed it for 5 days. This caused my delivery to pushed to new date. This was the fourth time.",Suzuki
"Friends personally I have seen some critical talks from the few garage people, even I asked them some question about what I wad planning to buy for my sister Suzuki Access 125 - 2010 model was so worst according to them. The garage mechanic told me that 2010 model was not in success platform even the made was so worst. the machines which gaves always trouble and need service every some time so what is the need of it. they stop me to buy it from old seller and more thing mechanic told me about it that it needs original parts to work, it means some time if we dont find any original parts so we cant repair until we get it.",Suzuki
Friends this one scooter actually look wise ok but there is some problems. and I would like share it.,Suzuki
"From last 1.5 years I am using Access. I have prob. with my bike is low mileage. I am getting constantly 35 kmpl from 1.5 years. I told this prob to suzuki service center guys at every servicing. bt still mileage prob. is not solved. Many people claimed that they get 45-50 kmpl. I tried Indian Oil, HP, BP petrol bt every time the mileage is same. Service my bike every 2 months. What's the problem?",Suzuki
From looking point of view its good and balancing of bike is also better. Its weight help you to run the bike at high speed with proper balancing. Since 2012 no major maintanance required. after every 1500 km run I go for servicng(only oil change),Suzuki
From past years we know that Access 125 is a popular and widely used Transporter in India so I am sharing my reviews regarding Access 125 even though scooters in Activa provide the equal mileage and space as in Access 125 even at an affordable price the scooter provides a front disc brake which locks up the wheel whenever we apply the break so please review your opinions,Suzuki
"From recent reviews, it looks like delivery time is getting reduced for Access. Also after that Activa was also available for immediate delivery.",Suzuki
"From the 1st month, scooter's engine is not working properly.",Suzuki
From the 3 months I had the Expence of the bike is 6200 and this expence is morre on new moped which is been recentle removed from the Company and Moped are getting brake.Access 125 the body is fully Plastic that whenever toches your moped some of the things will brake which is damn sure and the main part is the average of the moped is to low mainly my moped gives the 20 to 25 of average.,Suzuki
From the date of bought and now I changed its body 6 times ??.,Suzuki
"Front mud guard also give up quite early in life and it keeps rattling and broke very easily(does't matter how carefully you keep it). On approaching service center, prices for small parts are also kept very high and also insists on getting fixed on their service center.",Suzuki
"Front shockers are telescopic and are supposed to take path holes with ease but it doesn't. every small thing under the front tyre is felt on handle bars. Adding to problem, the outer coating or paint of telescopic shockers starts peeling off and it looks really ugly.",Suzuki
"Front shockers make ""crank"" sound in pits, I requested while first service of the scooter, but they could not help much.",Suzuki
"Front suspension is good, rear suspension makes u jump if u ride without pillion rider. Power is enough to overtake any scooter, even sometimes other 125CC bikes and 4-wheelers.",Suzuki
"Front tries are 130m/c 60p tube, actually these tries are not recommonded for the as such bike .",Suzuki
"Front: 20 PSI, Rear: 30 PSI. Best compromise between road grip and mileage for single and pillion riding within the weight limits.",Suzuki
"Fuel Consumption and fuel capacity is good 6 liter, good looks, 125 cc this Suzuki Access 125, Engine type 4 stroke, single cylinder, air cooled OHC. starting methot: self start and kick start, But price money this two wheeler is very costly. Overall is good.",Suzuki
"Fuel Consumption: 40-45 kilometers per liters guaranteed. I am getting this mileage but yes, I never ride like few reckless riders out there.",Suzuki
Fuel Tank Capacity: 5.60 litres and Reserve Fuel Capacity: 1 litres.,Suzuki
Fuel consumption is more that other if u want an ultimate answer,Suzuki
"Fuel consumption is very high, it gives 27 to 33 km/liter average.",Suzuki
Fuel consumption may look promising on papers but when you need a service after sometime for well working of the scooter the service al would be very bad. Very unsatisfactory.,Suzuki
Fuel consumption(45/1)(kms/liter) good pick up its totally my budget.,Suzuki
"Fuel consumption- As it comes with good powerful 125cc engine so don't expect that mileage will be good, I experienced it's mileage and comes to the conclusion that it's mileage is very poor, Company claims to have the mileage of above 40kmpl but it gives only 25-30kmpl.",Suzuki
Fuel consumption: The average of this scooty is actually not very good may be one of the reason is it's engine power as it comes with 125cc engine so we can't expect more average from it but there are some scooties in the market which are giving an average of 40kmpl as compared to this scooty which is giving 25-30 kmpl.,Suzuki
Fuel injection Technology provided by Suzuki Access so it is also good think gearbox call Sweety and engine bola is 52.5 yum yum Subah is also not so small this is my experience about my Suzuki Access 125 I hope it is good review for you or helpful for you if you want to buy this scooter I recommended for you.,Suzuki
Fule consumption is stunning 50 to 60km/l full average able bike.we can use it to drive in city and to go any long drive,Suzuki
Full fiber body and its parts rate more. example if front panel got small damage you have change whole panel and it cost is Rs1300.,Suzuki
Genuine review.I got the new 2016 Suzuki Access and getting around 140km for 4 litres of petrol filled when bought on the day.,Suzuki
Give balance to drive it and speed is 1to 50 km/h in only 15 to 20 sec and less time also l appeal.,Suzuki
"Gives about 50 kmpl in city traffic - after the 1st service. I've heard of a few people recording 55-60 kmpl., but I'm a bit doubtful of the mileage touching 60 kmpl.",Suzuki
Gives good road grip and pick up is also awsome. Mileage is given as promised.,Suzuki
"Gladly, Suzuki designers have taken stock of the situation and given the new Access 125 a fresh lease of life with respect to its appearance. The new Suzuki Access 125 gets more angular lines while the handlebar mounted large headlamp with chrome housing and apron mounted turn indicators give the new scooter a dominating face.",Suzuki
Go buy it and enjoy this lil champ but be careful on the topics which I mentioned above.Thank u all for reading this.Have safe ride and happy Life!,Suzuki
"God forbid, if stuck on the road you cannot do anything but to call service station. No service parts that you can do it yourself. I miss those bajaj days if it does not start- incline at an angle, clean the spark plug yourself etc. and what not.",Suzuki
"Going to the bicycle, it is attractive and has less fuel utilization contrasting with different scooties I have utilized previously.This bicycle has great solace and dependability is exceptionally good.The distinction I found in this bicycle is the impact of taking care of this scooty is simple in taking care of and above all the looks of this scooty is mind blowing. have obtained it in last walk stilli don't have any sort of negative impact on it.",Suzuki
Good afternoon friends today I writr a review about Suzuki acess 125 it is a most successful moped in india by suzuki it was introduced in 2007 and it is most liked moped after activa but after activa launched 125cc moped then its selling is low and now in 2017 suzuki lauch a new model with new look and new colour It has SEP engine which give extra milage and pickup to Suzuki access when it come to pickup then access has good pickup because it has 125cc engine which produces a power of 8.5 bhp at 7000 rpm and its engine is smoot it has disk brake in front I think its a good moped after activa so u can buy this instead of activa,Suzuki
Good boot space but you'll have to test with your own helmet to make sure it fits - not all do.,Suzuki
"Good choice...that is the best choice to go for if you can take a good decision...happy with the mileage...it gives mileage around 45 to 50 ...so it is one of the best mopet.... If it rains, well just wish someone doesn't make a sudden move. Its hard to control the bike travelling to 35 to 40kmh, starts weaving around.  ""That is the problem comes only when there is rain in the muddy roads...""",Suzuki
Good combination of power and weight 125 cc engine in 102 kg . I am getting a great millage due to this combition. Suzuki SEP technology really improve the performance of new access,Suzuki
Good driving position - Does not cause shoulder or back pain.,Suzuki
Good experience excellent scooter and very more confortable to drive and more confortable in seating arrangment and more confortable in weight mileage is 64 is tell company and we get 59 and smooth drive and good company service access 125 fuetures 125cc mileage 64 brake disc or drum tyre type,Suzuki
"Good for ladies and college going girls, But used careful for long Distance.",Suzuki
"Good looking, Stylish, Comfortable. But milage is 35-39 kmpl.",Suzuki
Good mileage. I am getting 48 in city and 52 to 55 in highways.,Suzuki
"Good morning friends, aaj mai aap logo ko apne jeevan ka experience batane ja rhi hu. Maine 3 saal pehle suzuki access khardi thi, mera ab tak ka safar bohat he badiea rha hai, umeed hai k aage bi accha he rhega.suzuki access house wife, college student, office employees, and other filed ke lyi bilkul perfect hai.

Eski seat bi bilkul perfect hai. Ese chalane se back pain jaisi problem nahi hoti hai. Eski light bohut hi shaandaar hai. Ese chalana or control krna bohat hi aasan hai.",Suzuki
"Good scooty , good mileage , and performance . I am also using suzuki scooty. So I feel like as bike riding so I trust suzuki access is very good performence. But his parts is not available in showroom . So I trusted only scooty.not showroom so I think that scooty is best perform in that time .",Suzuki
Good support at the rear to raise and get down from the main stand.,Suzuki
Good thing is that we got Test Ride as soon as we entered the Showroom. The vehicle was really good in my first impression. Also he said that the RC book will be provided in the form of smart card within 45days of delivery.,Suzuki
Got fixed mobile Charger-cum-holder at Rs.500/- to my left mirror.,Suzuki
"Got mine a week back after waiting of 32 days from Kothrud suzuki, Pune. Gotta say the scooter exceeded my expectations. Every thing is fine & much better than outdated Activa. This one is smply head turner. Evev today, I stopped at signal & got half a dozen queries(Feels soooooo good). So far, no probs what so ever.",Suzuki
Got to increase more dealers in the region. Truncate waiting list by half . Honda dealers  have a ability to sell you the scooter by hook or the crook. They kill competition. I escaped their temptation else I would be a owner of aviator. I saved few thousands.,Suzuki
"Got transfer from Kolkata to a Dist. hd. qrs town in Orissa few months back. Reported duty & stayed with my younger sister for a month( before I was settled) who has a scooty. Used her scooty several times & was very happy over the convenience this class of vehicle offers. Thought of buying one, but not so seriously. till such time I was not even aware that Suzuki-Access is available in the market.",Suzuki
"Gr8 acceleration in its category, and yes I did observe it zoom for 0 to 60 kph in 6 secs, a reason attributed to XTP.",Suzuki
Great LOOK!  This very useful scooter for Family. All members including Ladies.,Suzuki
Great bike for daily commute and also suitable for long rides.,Suzuki
"Great handling, power, comfort, etc.. but I don know about the mileage of this goody. I'll write a detailed review when I get my access.This is just a thanks giving post and the main review is on its way......",Suzuki
"Ground clearance - there is nothing to worry, the silencer will not touch the ground while riding through potholes even if fully loaded.",Suzuki
Ground clearance is good and self start is working fine. The waiting period for the bike is high. I got my bike after 2.5 months of booking.,Suzuki
"Guus im using this moped and this is my personal experience about this moped1. Mileage Superb. Im getting around 58km/lt2. Space is too comfort from inside and outside I think this is only moped bike which has more space.3. Road grip is good, pick up is good. And its a sep technology.4. Valaue for money.5. Engine sound is Very smooth.6. Features like mobile charging which is very essistenal for us. Charges too fast. Bit you need to pay extar 250rs extra for installation.",Suzuki
Guy's nowadays it is the popular for its mileage and sudden pickup. It's as good mileage up-to 55 to 60.It as SEP engine it as charging plot which we can charge anywhere anytime.It as daylighting headlights which will work morning also which reduces accidents. It as the best quality in Suzuki Showrooms.,Suzuki
Guys I have a worst experience with this scooty I have taken suzuki access 125 on februray 2017 this model scooty have several problems like vibration getting more sound in engine and also very poor mileage it gives around 30KMPL bad for mileage it you are buying for mileage dont take it but pick up performance is best.,Suzuki
"Guys this model is quite balanced in its designing , as its very confortable to ride , it has displacement of 124cc",Suzuki
HELLO FRIENDS I'M AMIT AND I'M GOING TO SHARE ABOUT SUZUKI ACCESS 125. IT IS AVERAGE SCOOTER IT GIVES AVERAGE MILEAGE AND THE COMFORT LEVEL OF SCOOTER IS UNSATISFIED THE SOCCER IS NOT GOOD . THE ROAD GRIP IS GOOD BUT AT THE TIME OF MONSOON IT HAS WORST GRIP IT SLIPS TOO MUCH AND THERE IS RISK OF FALL FROM SCOOTER.,Suzuki
"HELLO GUYS, SUZUKI ACCESS 125: I am using this scooty from 6 months, it is easy to ride withn it.When the market is rolling with vehicles like honda activa, honda aviator, tvs jupiter, and hero maestro . The upgraded version of this suzuki acces 125 can be a nice game in the moped industry. The newly upgraded design will play an important role in increasing the sales back. Now the suzuki access comes with a slightly powerful engine of 125 cc . Which is slightly more than that of honda activa. If we see the comfort aspect, then this is the plus point of this one . As this model gives you a higher comfort. I suggest you to try this scooty. Thank you, have a nice day.",Suzuki

"Hai friends, iam Mani iam going to write a honest review about Suzuki access 125. Ok lets start the review. Suzuki company is very popular and good company and also this Bike's features is very good. The mileage of Suzuki access 125 bike's is upto 45 to 55Kmpl, this is very good mileage camparing to other bike's. This Bike's comfort is very nice and the seat, also very comfortable and this Bike's weight is normal so easy to travel at city. This Bike's reliability for them who ready to buy a scooters.

I love this bike. I suggest you to buy this bike and this Bike's price also low. THANK YOU.",Suzuki
"Hai friends, today I am going to share my personal experience about my Suzuki access 125. Mileage: Compared with other bikes mileage of this bike also high. it gives a 45-55 kmpl.

Halloo my dear friends I was purchasing ALL NEW SUZUKI ACCESS 125 before last month. . its Amazing bike also very conformable all generation I like this bike so Much. the performance of this bike is impressive. This bike gives you supermodel and best millage and Powerful engine of this bike can be able to perform well. I have 1 month experiences with this super-bike.,Suzuki
Handle grip is good than other scooty. It gives good Mileage and comfort.,Suzuki
Handle quit bigger so handling is not easy task on tough roads,Suzuki
"Handling & Control- Handling & control is quiet good and pickup is also superb as it comes with 125cc engine but when you speed up it seems like scooty goes little bit out of control but it is rarely, so don't drive fast.",Suzuki
Handling &Comfort;- Designed the driving position gives comfort with confidence stability feel. Alighned the seating and handlebar is perfectly local or long drive. Inside of the city riding handling is excellent to say.,Suzuki
Handling and Control of the Suzuki Access is mind blowing with front disc break to make it single hand control.,Suzuki
Handling and Control: Handling wise it is good even the pickup is also good and it is a heavy model so there is no problem in handling while you are riding above 60 kmpl.,Suzuki
Handling and control of suzuki access is too good. Everyone can ride this scooty.,Suzuki
Handling and control of this scooter are not very good it is very tough to a new rider to ride this scooter.The handle of this scooter is also very uncomfortable to handle.,Suzuki
Handling and control: 2 models are present in market; one with front wheel disc brake and other with drum brakes. It's your own choice. I got one with drum brakes on both wheels and I never found difficult to handle even at 65-70 kilometers per hour.,Suzuki
Handling and riding of the Suzuki scooter is more stable and comfortable to ride and it is inspiring.,Suzuki
"Handling even in heavy traffic is comfortable.its suspension is pretty good and gives us smooth ride even on bad roads.over taking is easy task on this vehicle, but I am only just satisfied with the braking.a front disc brake could have given a great confidence to the scooter.",Suzuki
Handling even in heavy traffic is more COMFORTABLE and truly I never faced any problem with self start even in the winter season.,Suzuki
Handling is amazing and in crowded city it is worth the money.,Suzuki
"Handling is excellent. The new handlebar is taller(overall height is higher too) and it allows a more comfortable riding position. It also allows much taller riders to ride the Suzuki. But the little detail is that the Access 125 sits on a longer wheelbase – 1, 265mm, 15mm longer. This is perhaps why the Suzuki Access 125 feels stable and neutral rather than top heavy or too eager like scooters are wont to do.",Suzuki
Handling is good and comes with disc brake with all new feature it's means comes with mobile charger and 22 ltr space the access is very good. And exellent scooter for unisex.,Suzuki
Handling is smooth than other same rate bikes and company provided disc brakes for better control.,Suzuki
Handling is very very good and found no vibration good boot space and front pocket its alternative .,Suzuki
Handling of scooter is not so good. It takes lots of efforts to move it. Breaks are so so but not so good.,Suzuki
Handling of this scooter is very good even in traffic. I had not faced any problem in this scooter. It has very good gripping on surface. The acces 125 also offers a small lamp in storage compartment and usb charging for mobiles or other gadgets.,Suzuki
Happened to purchase this little wonder 25 days back. I am a avid car lover & never thought n planned to purchase a two-wheeler ever after my LML Vespa Scooter & Bajaj Chetak Scooter.,Suzuki
"Has been completely redesigned front profile New Suzuki Access 125 is designed with a lightweight frame also has been working on its styling. The scooter has been completely redesigned front profile. These changes in the new Apron, including large turn indicators and new headlamps. Large rear grab rail and sleek profile of the scooter Mud Guard said.",Suzuki
Hassle free driving without clutch and gear shift.(chennai and banglore people must go for this).,Suzuki
"Have purchased the scooter for my family. Before I cud purchase I had 2 options Honda Activa and Suzuki Access, looking at the reviews, pro's and con's, pricing, engine(cc) etc I opted to go for Access.",Suzuki
"Have taken a test ride based on the reviews posted on this site and fell in love with it and have booked the same delivery is slow but the wait is worth the time. I really liked the Autocop option that is available and it makes the scooter real chick, the blue colour of the scooter is really cool and the front telescopic absorbers are the need of the hour especially on Indian roads.",Suzuki
"Have the disc brake version . engine was too good. maintaince  cost was to low, Its weight is 102 kg. This scooter is light weight.",Suzuki
"Having taken my 2 wheeler license very lately (10 years after taking 4 wheeler), i was looking for a suitable gearless scooter. Obviously my first choice was Honda activa & 9 out of 10 people recommended for activa.I wanted a new model.So I started googling and shortlisted on 3 scooters. Honda Aviator, Access 125 & pleasure. Pleasure seemed to be a bit Girly, so I removed it from list.So I checked Aviator, looked good during test ride. But really didn't liked the shape.",Suzuki
He rides on the road and off the road also but get benifits with this bike.this bike can ride anywhere.if 3 prrsonsalso sit on it then nothing happen to it its look as  dame as before brand tyres with all brand features,Suzuki
He told me that the pollution exhaust was out of place.I had bumped into a big pothole on the way back,Suzuki
Head Light is good enough. Access has 125CC engine that promotes 8.5bhp at 7000 rpm. Pickup is far better that Honda Activa. Under Seat 20 Ltr space is good to keep your full face Helmet safe. Less noisy even at speed for 80 km/hr. Top speed approx 85 km.,Suzuki
Height of the scooty suitable for taller peolpe.it is batter option in scooty,Suzuki
Hello  namastey. This scooty is not good.  I purchased this scooty before my sister marriage.,Suzuki
"Hello , friends today I will share my personal experience on Suzuki access 125 which is truly a fashion icon. I have said this scooter a fashion icon because the body style and degisns are very cool and especially the cut edges at the back and a nice crome finish which make this scooter even more stylish. It has a 4 cycle single cylinder air cooled SOHC 2 value powerfull engine and produce the power of 125cc. Pick up is very good. Fuel consumption is also very good. Handling and control is very stable and good. You will feel comfort while riding. Overall the performance is excellent.",Suzuki
"Hello Friends Today I am reviewing the Suzuki Access 125cc bike. I am using this bike from past 10 days. This is yet comfortable but body is made up of plastic. The newer looks are gentle. Unfortunately, I met with the accident yesterday. My access is crashed and all the plastic gets out. The mileage is of course good and pickup is also good. Reliability is also good.

"Hello Friends, Today I would like to give a review on new access 125. The new model is quite high on its ground clearance and with bigger seat. The engine is quite less powerful than its old model but it's economy has been increased so mileag is the plus point. The storage space is quite more big with the charging power port. And is good in handling and with good braking power. It's more lighter in weight comparing to other 125CC Scooters. It's a good scooter with big storage with powerful engine with comfort. So I would like to buy this one surely in other 125CC engine Scooters.",Suzuki

"Hi Friends, Suzuki access 125 is good scooter but I Said Honda is best scooter ever Suzuki access 125 is light weight scooter so that why everyone drive suzuki access 125 the average of suzuki access 125 is 35-40 and the pick up average suzuki access 125 look is not so good the honda activa also drive men but suzuki access also drive by men but its look is woman style. So I said this scooty is not good.",Suzuki
Hi Guys I have bought this Scooty 2 years ago. no doubt it has been lasted till now. It worth it for money. The mileage has been good enough. I has a stylish look and in good in color. It was very comfortable & very smooth to drive. the wide and long seat is plush and comfortable and it's suitable complemented by the suspension. All sorts of bumps are absorbed quite nicely . Overall Nice & best Scooty to drive,Suzuki
Hi I purchased this Suzuki Access 125. in 2016. My usage is minimal within the city limits only. The mileage is low(30-35kmpl).Pickup and ride comfort is good. Service centres in Delhi are worst. They are worst even compared to non mechanic. They just bill you and return the vehicle as such. good water wash and 3 M polish your service is done. 24K kms the engine has started giving problem enquired with several access customers every body is complaining about the worst service and engine problem after 18K kms.,Suzuki
"Hi all I have done 20, 500 km on my access 125 and would like to give a real feedback. About my driving, I ride my scooty in a very relaxed manner all the time. The first problem arrived after 3 month's of buying was a bent in handle T bar, I thought it's a normal thing it can happen anytime coz of our country's roads, next thing I got to know about was a weard noise coming from gear box I went to service centre these guy's told me it's a manufacturing fault we will fix it and will not charge me anything I was like clueless, thinking myself am I made a mistake buying Suzuki product although they are a Japanese brand, things went smooth for some time and another problem arises engine oil leakage. My scooty engine oil level started dropping down this time. Again the service guy's were very normal saying that it's a normal thing, these engines usually face these kind of problems now and then I am really very SAD after the Suzuki experience. Very bad product. My thoughts are very clear with Suzuki now will never ever suggest someone to buy Suzuki 2 wheeler I doubt about there Bike's coz now a days they are manufacturing big bikes like Hayabusa in India don't know what they will do to it. Please some one from Suzuki Japan do the cross check what is happening in India. Don't spoil your brand image. Suzuki is launching his new scooter Burgman Street with the same engine so people out there please make sure you invest your money wisely.",Suzuki

"Hi all, Odo reads 1102km no and I got my first service done. Dealer was co-operative, since it was first service I personally wanted to know the details under hood. Battery is located under front foot rest (Amazed!), the vent you see near leg room is engine cooling duct, Mr sparky is deep inside and to access him with spanner you need to flip open left side small lead. Dry foam type air filter who breaths under the seat. As documented in first service overleaf, oil and oil filter were changed, valve clearance was adjusted, complete wash and wax was done brilliantly.",Suzuki

"Hi guys! Im a suzuki employee working in a showroom, I can say that suzuki access 125cc is one of the best bike from suzuki motors. As im going to share my opinion on access 125. It comes with drum break, as well as rear disc break and also with a special mat finish coating called special edition. In drum style there are several colors red, blue, white, black, grey & silver. Other alloy with disc break bikes has only white, grey & black colors. The major highlight was its suspension, the front base tyres are higher than the back base, so we can handle the moped easily without hand pain. The engine was so good and smooth even when we are reaching 80km/h in an highway road, there is no vibration are heavy sound. Coming to the milleage part, it gives 40km in traffics inside the city and 45-50 km in in a highway road. For an overall performance it is good family bike, any one can drive the bike easily.",Suzuki

Honda access is not that much gud it is bad in mileage even the bike is very low weight bike by that we can fall down easyily reliability is too bad we can not take this bike in long trip bcoz it so less in weight and it is also not run problem in roads bcoz of small wheels and appel is also veryy low so it not better we need to increase his weight so it can run properly in road we need to change his road grip and mileage is also too bad bcoz of less milage we can’t ride this bike in city and also it looks is not as much better,Suzuki
"Honda started this trend with its energetic engine of Activa and stylish design of Dio. Access taken this to one more step by presenting a 125cc scooter. People who are inclined for more power and ability to overtake other bikes, without the burden of changing gears opt for access. For a normal user who simply wants a scooter for his/her day to day commutation,  scooters like Activa or wego would be sufficient.",Suzuki
"Honestly I am not being biased, it beats in performance as compared to its competition.",Suzuki
"Honestly I am saying this scooter is very very poor in mileage( 30 to 35) and need a high maintenance . Body type is very cheap not by looks and broken with very small accident . Believe me friends in one word its not upto mark , I have purchased this cause getting best mileage experience from gs150r . I sell it , now I am looking for a new scooter , if any one here please suggest me what should be better option in mileage segment . Please",Suzuki

"How many scooter manufacturers r their in India. Bajaj has no scooter in its bag which is worth riding. LML is not unisex scooter, hero honda pleasure targets only women.  Kinetic is a no- no when it comes to fuel consumption and maintainence. So in the end its only honda and suzuki. Activa ruling the roost for last 6 years and had no competition. In some cities it is still sold with booking. That is a great surprise to me when I went to purchase one. I could not wait for 21 days booking for a scooter. At that time I even did not know that a 125 cc scooter of suzuki exists on this earth which is available in my city READILY. For this 125 cc beauty I came to know only through internet surfing. And rest is history with a red suzuki( my son's favorite colour) in my garage.",Suzuki
"However its been a few years since the access 125 was first lunched in 2007. A special edition Suzuki access 125 with some cosmetic changes was also introduced in 2013.

"However the if we compare the cost B/w Honda Aviator & Suzuki Access, Suzuki has comparatively less cost, even the maintenance cost is also less, over a period of time Access has been improved both in Style & performance as well. If we talk about Styling it has been given an international Look which is lacking in this segment of Scooty.",Suzuki
However the scooter carried me for another 3 -4 km before coming to a halt. Fortunately a mechanic was just a km away and he changed the airfilter and dried the spark plug and voila. the scooter was back on the road again.,Suzuki

So now, in 2016, Suzuki has introduced a facelifted and upgraded version of the all-new Access 125. The 2016 Suzuki Access 125 will be sold alongwith the older model, at a slight premium. So, what's new?",Suzuki

I booked a blue colour and drum brakes variant which looked very classy. But during those days it had a high demand due to which I got mine almost after 3 months which was very annoying for me.when I finally got it I enjoyed the first ride.It was very smooth, comfortable the only thing which I did'nt like was its engine sound. the glossy blue looks too good and shines awsomely under the sun. The 3D logo look shiny and classy, retro look of head light is very eye catching. it has a very good leg space. Talking about the mileage, company claims it to be 64 kmpl but I never tried to find it out by myself. The seat is very spacious which allows comfortable sitting.Its been one and a half year and it has no worries till now.",Suzuki

Not only this their service is also superb, they are giving 4 free services 5 paid services, also you can choose different colours, you can also buy special edition in matte black colour, now the cost of the bike also increased compared to previous price because they are giving 5 years insurance at one time.

There were also many problems related to battery and the kick gets stucked in the center stand ! Please guys do not buy this bike just because it can run fast ! Instead buy activa 3g.access 125 is totally waste bike .I would give it a 1* out of 5,Suzuki

"I argued that the company cannot run out any vehicle if it does not fulfill RTO requirements, even then I was forced to buy the accessories for Rs. 1900/-. The same accessories are available in city market for Rs. 600/-. The on road price I paid to dealer was Rs. 50700/- whereas I found that the On Road Price on the website of Suzuki Motorcycles was about Rs. 48000/-. That means The dealer charged me aprox Rs. 3500/- extra.",Suzuki

Behind it was the fuel tank with a nice and prominent lid.  When the seat was closed, everything is nicely concealed.  The front fork is built tough like a motorcycle and utilized telescopic tubes, which slide in an out.  So no bushes to wear out.",Suzuki

"I bought Access 125 with 5 years warranty Since 1st week scooter engine is switches off after few meters on its own, the moment I press break, engine is switched off. The moment scooter goes over speed breaker, engine is switched off, this is quite annoying and dangerous. I have being giving scooter for servicing regularly. There are several times when scooter has stopped in middle of the road and other vehicles almost have come and about to hit me from behind. This is Safety issue. I have shown to service center several times however there is no solution. Today because of this engine switch off issue, my 2.5 years kid fell down, I am very upset. It was big mistake to buy Access 125. Do not every buy Access 125 scooter, they are cheats. Safety and security is big issue. Second problem is very poor mileage of 10 km initially and now it is 20 km, service center says this happens because it is new scooter, however its has being over 6 months, still mileage is about 20 km which is really poor.",Suzuki
"I bought Access after a lot of contemplation.  The scooter is good and returns a faily average mileage.  The worst thing about this scooter is a  VERY VERY limited supply of spares.  The front mudguard is so designed that I u accidentally hit something in front, ur tyre will not hit the object but the mudguard will definitely hit and break.",Suzuki
"I bought Access in March 2010. Initially it gave 20 kmpl; afterwards average increased to 30 kmpl. I did paid servicing at authorized service centers. After 5& half years one mechanic found out the fault & suddenly average jumps to 55kmpl. Actually choke pipe was leaked & due to this vehicle consumed more petrol for 5 and half years. Nobody in the service station could able to find out the fault; one private mechanic from Dapodi, Pune rectified it! His shop is Sai Motors. I strongly recommend Not To Buy this Vehicle! Though ride quality is good & comfort too; but very poor after sales.",Suzuki

"I bought Suzuki access 125 a month ago. I was looking for style this time and I couldn't find anything better than this. It is too stylish, looks too cool. It's chrome head lamp cover is it's first adjective. The front fender and leg shield are of steel which is a safety additive. Talking about power, it's four stroke 125 cc all aluminum engine giving 8.7 ps at 7000 rpm and 10 Nm at 5000 rpm with latest SEP technology from Suzuki is unmatched. Talking about peripherals, it has digital Meter in such a price range which no one will give. The seat is long along with foot board making it comfortable. Front disc brake is an added feature. It has much storage space and a front pocket too which I have not seen in any other. Now the most important thing, mileage.it is on average 55-60 kmpl which is more than any other. Go for it",Suzuki
"I bought Suzuki access125 1.5 years ago. It was the worst scooty I have ever ride. It was not all worthy, it is totally waste of money if you are buying Suzuki access125. I had a very bad experience with it. I would never suggest anyone to buy this scooty. Scooty's silencer is too bad that I can't explain it makes so irritating and annoying sound. Brakes are useless are they are not combined. After every two or three weeks you have to replace it's break shoe. Mileage is also not good it only runs 27 or 28 km/litre.",Suzuki

When ever I told them they said the same thing. First service they told me it's done after two day again I am facing with same problem. Till third service same thing happened. Four days back head light totally gone bad. yesterday I went there I told them full thing then they started doing it but main problem with wire which connected with it. I told them to change it then they dont have that wire in there stock. Finally I went to some out service center then did it.we are not satisfied with service of Suzuki Access 125.,Suzuki
I brought the suzaki Access 125(grey color) bike 8 months back and I had very bad experience in terms of mileage and bike performance. Daily it used to get stopped at middle of my journey and spare parts got repaired after 6 month. I suggest you guys just think before purchasing this item.,Suzuki
"I buy sujuki access 125 bike in 2010. Upto now I used this bike. This is comfortable bike to ride. Bike's fuel effitiancy is very good. My bike is given me average is 58km/ltr. Honestly I told you if you are purchage a new vechile the sujuki access 125 is a good choice. The features of the sujuki access 125 is they are provide telyscophic suspension in front, mooe leguage space in front and belo the sitting seat, there is low maintenance cost. Please choose thank you.",Suzuki
"I buyed this scooter 8 months ago.i think its better than activa 125 and activa 4g. the attractive features are - big seat. Big storage capacity, mobile charging , tubeless tyres, nice attractive colours like blue and silver, gud engine with 5 years extra warranty, and great millage and good service ! I thought thus scooter is definately going to win the battle in the upcoming days in the scooter market! Loving it",Suzuki
"I called them today to their landline no: @ 11:44am before reaching service center. They mentioned my vehicle will be ready by 2PM and I can come over there to collect it. I reached service center @ 3PM, when I showed my slip to the security guy. He was checking for the vehicle and took me inside and found that my vehicle was in the same state and mentioned that they have not even started the washing of the vehicle which is the first stage of servicing.",Suzuki
I can rely a safe drive on Suzuki Access for atleast 50-100 kms as well.,Suzuki
I can surely give good review on this bike because I like it.it gives 50 -60 mileage,Suzuki
I can tell you about Suzuki access 125CC is one of best bike of Suzuki motors. As I am going to share my opinion.,Suzuki
I can't comment on hero maestro vs access as I did not get a chance to drive maestro and even i did not see anyone driving maestro.,Suzuki
I cant comment on mileage as it just had covers 125 kms yet.It gave me trouble once but it was due to the Air Pipe which got disconnected. I called the service center and the boy came and fixed the issue same day.,Suzuki
"I completely ignored Mahindra Duro, Kinetic Flyte as they were not much popular and  reviews said they have ground clearance issues. Since mostly the scooter is used by my wife I did not want to give it a try.",Suzuki
"I completely read all the lines of all your reviews and found encouraging to book my vehicle in the same dealer. Earlier I had a test drive in ABT and later booked it swapna. I'm waiting for about a month and dealers are showing not much enthu now a days, and that makes me worrysome.",Suzuki
I contacted a mechanic near by and asked him to help. to my surprise the engine oil was nil only with the use of 1 month only.,Suzuki
"I could easily take up a calculator and calculate the Mileage, but below I will give you a practical example for the petrol it consumes",Suzuki
"I crashed it one time and still for some scratches and some fenders, it has been doing great.",Suzuki
"I did learn a lesson, one must never buy a vehicles only because its good, but should buy it if the service is good too.",Suzuki
I did lot of survey and comparison between activa and access. But on all the fronts access won over activa.,Suzuki
"I did nt personally like the sound of horn, it sounds very tweety and small",Suzuki
I didn't find any cons for the bike. The ride is comfortable and I get a mileage of 45-50Km/Litre (BTW I always go for shell super petrol).,Suzuki
I disliked this suzuki access 125 scooty because there are many scootys less than this rate for many features.I have average experience with this bike but activa is more best and better than this scooty.,Suzuki
I do not find the scooter reliable as there is a lack of engine power in terms of pickup and efficinecy and hence makes it low in toughness.,Suzuki
"I do not want to declare my name, on this complain as I know it was also have no effect, better you take care of you service outlets.",Suzuki
"I don't know much about activa and dio and all I can say is that I did the right thing in going for this scooter .it was a gamble that paid off. This scooter is the combination of activa and dio . It looks nice though some may argue , suits perfectly for the whole family like activa and still has lots of power like dio. So I say that if you want basic family scooter that can carry luggage and people and not power go for the activa and if you want thrill in riding then go for the dio and if you want both go for the access, you will not regret your decision.",Suzuki
I don't think its an appealing scooter from Suzuki.You can have more better scooters in same segment.,Suzuki
I don't think that any doubt about the secure access being the most popular 125cc scooter withthis kind o efficiency performance,Suzuki
"I don't understand what happened to my bike, when ever I had a problem I will took my bike to suzuki service centre, every time they took 1 day for repair and  they will say new issues and need to change a part in bike they simply give me a 2500 to 3000 bill but the problem was that not solved and its make a irritating sound amd it to remains same. I was totally fed up with this scooty.",Suzuki
I dont like one things that is it lock.when we use 2 years and more we must change our lock.company should imporve this.it is also come with tubeless tyre.I love this .its look up is very impressive.,Suzuki
"I dont recommend going for access because over the run I found lagging, oil leakage and low average, requires service every 1.5 months with oil change, engine sound also changed. took review from others and found it leads to costing more after 2 years of usage. average was good for around 1 year and then gradually decreased over the time. u will not find the same power and ride comfort after long usage",Suzuki
"I drive approx 40 kms average per day from home to office & return+ some customer visits. The braking is very average and if compared with Active OR Deo, is poor.",Suzuki
I driver suzuki Access 125 its very excellent to drive. its look better than other scooter. Acess maintains charges also normal. It as fabri body. It made by new digital meter display the chrome fitting in front is very amazing. The service also very good. It get super millage. The suzuki Access 125 can use all age group people. The reliability of scooty as very nice. It as good speed& pulling capacity. The weight of Access 125 is 102Kg. The chases is excelant it as auto-clutch. It as three different colors. Access 125 ginseng is excellent. I suggest people to bye Access 125 to bye because comparing to other scooty it very nice to drive& it as more space. Super scooty to derive .,Suzuki
"I drove this scooter on many occassions and found it a comfortable ride, unlike honda activa a wide comfortable seat allows to travel long rides with suzuki.",Suzuki
I eliminated TVS Jupiter because of:- Lack of Interest by the sales teams at A) Ashwa TVS & B) Bharat TVS,Suzuki
"I everyone I owner this access 125 4 years ago, its milage is good & its look is also looking good, a big head light, with lagre indicators, the important this is that its having a disk break also in front wheeles, i like its speed its good speed compare to activa, the service of suzuki access 125 is also in ur buddget, it having a very comfort seat for 2 or 3 persons.it also have a good handeling & control.the leg room is also big.there is no problem for big boys or girls to drive.the main thing fuel consumption is also very low, by this we got good average & we cover approx 25 to 27 km in 1 liter., the ful tank capasity is 21 lites, according to me its sufficent for everyone.its having the power of 125 cc.",Suzuki
I feel if you buy it you are also not satisfy with this scooter.,Suzuki
"I feel its certainly better then Activa. For 100 cc engine Access has, its supposed to give more mileage. But I guess its not. Then Access is a clear winner here.",Suzuki
I feel that the price is a little steep but considering that the same is from the suzuki stable it should be worth the same ( Only time can tell the same),Suzuki
I found that access is really a good choice and it will give a strong competition to access. However I was not able to calculate its mileage because its just 5 days I bought access. I will post my review about mileage once its first service will done.,Suzuki
"I gave my vehical to service,  they gave it back in 2hrs saying service is done and they took money,  I took my vehical and was on my way back,  almost withing 4-5km my vehical caught fire. As I got access to water I could prevent petrole tank on fire or it would be a fatal on a busy road.",Suzuki
I gone through many reviews thanks to mouthshut.finally decided on access 125 black color with disc brakes.got it for 72k on road hyderabad price but bs 3 version but ok nice.,Suzuki
"I got a 600km run Access , 7 months old , for approx 9k lower than the showroom price ; not a great deal but the fact that I did not have to wait OR haggle with unprofessional dealers made this a fair deal.",Suzuki
I got changed my stock hologen bulb - A.C. 35w with 42w LED Bulb (D.C.) - cost Rs.600/- with slight wiring. Now my vehicle headlight gives me almost 5 times more light then stock bulb.,Suzuki
"I got feedback from so many friends who were having activa and they told me that everything is fine in activa except mileage. Mileage was from 30 - 35 KM PL. And because of this constraints, the running cost of activa was very high.",Suzuki
I got good service at authorized service centre of Suzuki. My scooter got serviced on the same day.,Suzuki
I got my Access 125 on 26th June 2008 after booking it on 14th March 2008 in Pune. Such a long waiting period ..!!,Suzuki
"I got my Access a year ago from Swargate motors, Pune. I had only 2 options either Activa or Access. The latter won hands down.",Suzuki
"I got my Access in Jan, 2010. I have been using Access for last 10 months (8500Kms). Overall, I am very happy with the vehicle. It gives me a milege of almost 50 in city riding. However, the rear suspension gives a bumpy ride and of late I see the rear wheel wobling a little bit. The service center guy told me that may be the vehicle might have bumped in a trough. It definitely has bumped a lot in the troughs, but does that make it wobble?? Please share your experiences about this, if any.",Suzuki
I got my Access today... in 1 hour.. walk-in..pay... and drive out...,Suzuki
"I got my Suzuki access on 19th Aug and to this date I have clocked 300kms. Guys u need to ride to believe excellent handling and feel, I am living in one of the excellent location where all terrains are at vicinity. I have already made my Access climb 2000mts  and was easy. Braking is excellent and so is the reliability.",Suzuki
"I got my access a week back. Due to increase in demand the proce has gone up by around 2000 RS. but believe me, it's worth. In mumbai on road with accessories it was close to 49k.",Suzuki
"I got my suzuki access 125 cc on 16 th sep, Previously I had apache 150 cc and hero honda splendor.I met with an accident by applying only front brake(due to disc) and got skidded from my bike(minor accident only).What iam trying to say here is - Applying Disc brakes alone is very very dangerous",Suzuki
I got my vehicle on July 22 08 my vehicle color is red I was mainly concerned with mileage of the vehicle which was told that it will 60 km pl but later after using it I found out that the mileage was only 32 kmpl then I thought after the first service it may improve.,Suzuki
"I got the best one because the wide and long seat is plush and comfortable and it's suitably complemented by the suspension. All sorts of bumps are absorbed quite nicely, so potholes and minor road undulations are taken care of without any judders.it's fuel consumption is less and it is really comfortable bike good suspention quality. reliability of this bike is also better in class.I am really happy for purchasing this bike.",Suzuki
I got the top speed is 90 is very high for scooter is very good and fast.,Suzuki
I got this 4 weeks back and have completed 950 KMS. About to give the scooter for the first service. The delivery was immediate.,Suzuki
"I guess it will be a good idea for Suzuki to concentrate on this market which is still to be looked on by other manufracturers except Honda. Access is damn good on Looks, comfort, reliability and comfort.",Suzuki
"I had Splendor, prior to buying this, which I had successfully used for 10 years, was still in excellent condition when I sold it.",Suzuki
I had a experience of using this scooter of almost 6 months and according to the price this one is the best scooter ever,Suzuki
"I had a experience of using this scooter of almost 6 months and according to the price this one is the best scooter ever thumps up for this scooter all the time and this bike can be used for heavy works and all. And now lets talk about the reviews of this scooter in terms of mileage it gives me to 55 - 55 kmpl and that must be a good mileage for the scooters of all kinds. According to comfort it is very smooth if you are comparing with some other model in various bike like activa, Jupiter etc., the suspension is very smooth and good for me its almost end of 6th month and its still like it was in the beginning, the best thing I was like in the bike the height, the space, the boot space beneath the seat is much more in the normal scooter a full size helmet and also much things like gloves, bottle can be together kept in it and that thing is pretty good about this scooter and the space given for the charger and also a pocket in front to kept bottle or a mobile phone according to its look it is sweet and simple looking bike and the back light look is awesome and also the alloy wheel give this scooter is great look and only one thing is missing in this is the external fuel tank, but it is ok since the seat gets open from the front always we don't want to remove keys, and the tank capacity is good if you are going to buy this bike then just go don't want to remove keys, and the tank capacity is good if you are going to buy this bike then just go don't think much you have decide right one. Go ahead you will feel after some more years, yes I done a good decision to buy a best scooter ever I will assure you this is going to happen. I recommended this to you all, you will be fell great comfort while you ride this scooter other then activa, Jupiter etc.",Suzuki
"I had a smooth drive of the vehicle. it gives access and utmost satisfaction. only thing lacking in the vehicle is that, it doesn't gives fast drive. it means, the rash drive. hence, bike riders are not suitable to own or drive the vehicle. teen age gals and guys are suitable for the suzuki access ride. through I am not in teen age, I love this bike very much",Suzuki
"I had a very bad experience with the vehical specially on the rainy season, it always got stuck on road due to air filter problem, air filter always get wet and vehical won’t start and won't accelerat at all, in rainy season my bike used to consume 7-8 air filters.wrong position of the air filter on vehical, just above the rear wheel and due to that all the water gets in to the air filter and bike will stuck.very bad experience",Suzuki
"I had bought Activa in July 2010. After travelling more than 4600 Kms and experiencing its ride quality for almost 10 months, I still wonder why people book ACTIVA and are ready to wait more than 6 months for its delivery.",Suzuki
I had bought access 125 2 year ago. after one year I got my engine problem I saw this to service station but I do not got any solution for that. Mileage was very low after one year of use.,Suzuki
I had bought the Access125 in Aug.2009.However recently it is creating a great noise while starting the vehicle everyday.After  two to three minutes the noise get stopped.The mwchnic has said that that is a common problem.Can the Co.provide any solution.Also the handle grip is also of inferior quality.The rubber cover  should have been provided for kick so that it will not give trouble while making start kick,Suzuki
"I had bought this vehicle from the Suzuki showroom which is located in Old Airport Road. The people there treat you very good and explain the process in a good way. This is the only scooty which has only 125 CC engine, its very heavy which makes it little stable. If you are not taking the accessories the vehicle can still be taken on to the road unlike its other competitors. They have 5-6 colors in access 125.",Suzuki
"I had buy my access 125 about 3 years ago, It is very good scooty for handling, pickup, & average in looks.But it gives lots of maintainence, low milage & full fiber body which gives this scooty demerit.Company also gives lack of services, Overall by my experiance scooty is nyc bt other comepetitors are strong in market.",Suzuki
"I had drove suzuki access for a week of my friend when he was out of city. I found it so bulky and heavy.the pickup is good (coz of 125 cc engine) but the average I got was only 37 in city where as I own pleasure it gives me 54 in city(100 cc). The front suspension is good.but the sitting arrangement is not so good.the moped is strongly not for ladies...(as mopeds are mainly made for ladies suzuki doesn't understand the concept that this is ladies bike..) the handling is poor, hard to balance the bike in city traffic, the silencer looks outdated(seems to come outside from the bodyline).",Suzuki
I had given 3 services till now and waiting for the 4th one. Still it gives the same kmpl. I ride in less traffic areas and within 30-50 kmph speed only.,Suzuki
I had good experience with Suzuki showroom located at Paud road(Pune) called as Automatic Suzuki.,Suzuki
I had insufficient for me for a long drive you have to fill your petorl tank after very well.,Suzuki
"I had purchase this bike on may 2016 when it was newly launched after do physically check of all similar segment bike like honda activa tvs jupiter hero mestro nd one more that I m nt remindig right now from other brand. yes obviously this bike is expensive apprx. 5000 from other similar brands bt by paying this extra amount we get extra CC, mobile charger, extra length of seat, extra leg space, big storage under seat where I can put my stoods helmet even, one place of key from where we can open the dicky as well start the bike. all of the above bike is less weight nd high average compare to all similar bike segment",Suzuki
"I had purchased Access 125 in 2015, silver colour through SMK Motors in Porur, Chennai. From the beginning, the comfort of using this bike was bit hard when used for long distance, so I rather recommend this bike for casual driving. I drive close to 60 Kms in a day, to and fro using this bike. Sharing my experience on the mileage, on an average 35 Kms per litre of petrol.",Suzuki
I had purchased suzuki access in february. look wise access it is far better than new honda activa. It is also comfortable to handle and ride. But my accees gives around 35 - 40 KMPH. MY LOCALITY IS FULL OF BUMPY AND BAD ROADS.,Suzuki
"I had replaced these bulbs with LED Bulbs at a cost of Rs.180/- without any wiring work. A flasher (Rs.70/-) has been fixed along with a buzzer (Rs.30/-). However, back side break light remains A.C. stock bulb only.",Suzuki
"I had ride the vechicle continuosly for 25km twice, without any trouble.",Suzuki
"I had to push the brank new access 3 times so far, so I a dont trust this vehicle.",Suzuki
"I had used Suzuki access 125 in black color for almost 3 years , I am very unhappy with the company because just for first one year the bike was good in condition but after that it needed servicing almost each month which was really hectic job .it didnt gave expected average later on.its breaking system also collapsed frequently.its milage was fair even the comfort level was ok .overall it was not good experience with this bike",Suzuki
"I had used suzuki access 125 for around 4 years, I had bought it for 52000rupees on road, b ut after buying it I had a pathetic experience with this two wheeler, as it was completely made of plastic body and if it gets fallen down, its body will get broken, but thats not a major issue.lets talk about its performance, the fuel consumption was very poor as it only gives around 25-30km/litre in city and around 30-35km/litre on highways.other scooters available in market easily gives about 40-50km/litre.",Suzuki
"I had worst experience with Aryan motors KR PURAM, I gave service on 9 November 2012. Mr Ayappan delivery in charge person said they will not able to give it on November 9 and it will be delivered on next day. I agreed for that.",Suzuki
I hate this bike I dont want to anyone but this scooty the jupiter is best for everyone and comfortable for families use.,Suzuki
I have 4 pieces this bike my all brothers love this bike this is a great bike,Suzuki
"I have 4 scooty of the same company & it's the best, smooth feels settled at roads, Swift, great at looks, nice & affordable at price.",Suzuki
"I have Suzuki Access 125 gives average about 20-25Km per litre. It is very costly for me to ride 100km or more. The accessories of this scooty is costly when it damaged or broken. Its weight is so heavy also which girls & woman cant push, pull or turn when scooty in off condition. The tire qualtiy is also not so good. Its skid on the roads and some time I fell down also due to skiding. All the parts are also costly. Its race is too speedy due to 125cc so we need to care for race everytime. Its not bad but its not good also. This looks of this scooty is not so stylish. The service of this scooty is also costly. All over it is expensive.",Suzuki
"I have a Suzuki Access 125 moped which I bought keeping the good name of Suzuki as a brand in mind but I regret my decision of buying it. In the early days the bike ran smoothly with no issues but after a year or so we started facing the issues. Within 2.5yrs of use I have to change the block piston of the bike which costed me around 3.5k, braking system of the bike is so bad that even after changing the rear drum and brake shoes the brakes won't do there job. It's a major issue of the bike none of the brakes work. I won't recommend to go for this moped as I am facing many problems.",Suzuki
I have a daily running of approx 22KM which is around 132KM for six days and on the 7th day I have to refill the tank which by then give a indicator showing one bar.,Suzuki
I have a great experience of suzuki access 125.I know very well about this bike because all member of my drive it. It is very comfortable for women which not like to drive heavy bikes so that I think it is need of family in this era.It is big need of this era as females also participate in every field and no one have enough time to pick and drop them if all member are busy in their jobs. So that it is very comfortable bike to save time and money also due to it use very less oil according my experience it consume 1 litre for 75 km which is very suitable. It is very comfortable bike and those men which is above 70 age can drive it easily because it is not heavy bike .it is light bike which have not enough weight. It has excellent shape and shape is most important to attract the customer .It has excellent shape which attract all customers specially ladies and old men which like this kin of bike very much.,Suzuki
"I have a great experience with this scooter, no doubt this is a nice piece of engineering art. last year I had bought one of it and, I have no problem with this scooter up to date except battery or spark plug minor issue. I am completely impress with its engineering aspects like its performance, strength, better handling, high stability at its top speed and economic fuel efficiency. Its aerodynamic and stylist design real impress me and also my friends. Scooties are  real good option to move in intercity or to long distance because they are light in weight and comfortable that’s why I had chooses it and I also recommended to other to have this. We can trust on it after all Suzuki is a trusted brand. I want to suggest Suzuki to do some more unique innovation which will attract more customers, it will be highly beneficial if they do something in fuel consumption field. I again used to say this this is a nice one.",Suzuki
I have a great mileage. I have better mileage that other scooties except activa. you would be knowing that activa have launched new HET series whose full form is Honda Eco Technology which has mileage of 60 kmpl and ou get somewhat mileae around 55 kmpl in suzuki access but I do not feel any difference between acccess and activa. there would be very minor difference in mileage of both scooties. but there is also a minus point in this scooty which that it good a full plastic body which is not good. disadvantage of plastic body that it breaks very easily. I am not saying it because others say like this. I am this because I have experienced it. once driving I met with with a accident but not severe one it was quite minor but then also area below headlight broke. and you would not believe that my that accident was with cycle. but that cycle was in great speed. so you should realize that this scooty have body which could be broken by a cycle which is in great speed. from past  three to four months engine of my scooty have started making very loud noise. overall I like this scooty. it is a great scooty.,Suzuki
"I have a question here, If the parts are genuine then why cant they assure a minimum guarantee or them?",Suzuki
I have a suzuki access 125 an it is the best in power it can touch upto 110 but I would not recommend it has a good capacity of 500 liter tank I used to get about 40 milage per liter which is good with such power I will recommend this access to any one with the new competitions comming up it is still a great scooter any I had used it for almost 5 yrs and it is as new as the maintanence is also low,Suzuki
I have a suzuki access 125 cc of 2010 model. my wife used to drive this. she used to go to market for shopping on this. but sadly only after travelling 24000 kms this bike is now needs engine to open.,Suzuki
I have a very bad experiences about this scooter please don't buy this kind of scooter.,Suzuki
"I have all the 3 scooter owned by my family members viz. Scooty, Activa & Pleasure. Out of all I  rate this scooter best.",Suzuki
"I have already told you that who feel fear to drive on gears bike they definitely opt of this type of vehicle. As this vehicle is 125cc, we could not think to get into danger while we driving it.",Suzuki
I have an assess 125 in black color it almost got more than 3 years.,Suzuki
I have baught suzuki access 125 and I am using it for last three months.Its seat is not comforrtable like other scooters.The only thing I like about it is its mileage but the money saved is again wasted on its services and body parts.Its material is not of good quality Within three months I have make 6 visits to the mechanic and agency for its various problems including its engine voice; self problem etc.I also faces the loss of visibility at night due to its poor light.it can result in accidents.The braking system is good but it vibrates when we ride it above speed of 65.,Suzuki
I have beem using this scooter for almost 2 years naw but with time am getting in deeper love with this bike. The performance and smoothness of Bike is as good as new.,Suzuki
I have been a suzuki customer in the past. I loved the old Accest. It was more comfortable and with better looks. This old access is poor in looks. It is more of a lady ride. I would recommend to go for Honda Activa. Activa has got better looks and wide body which looks great. I haven't seen any issues with activa. And the new activa has got more better looks of the headlight and a digital screen. Activas exhaust sound is better than Access. And even the servicing price of honda is less than Suzuki. I would say no to the new Access for this time.,Suzuki
"I have been driving my access 125 for more than a year. In this period, I had analyzed my scooter's pros and cons. I have also read many professional reviews and comparisons on access. I thought of providing a comprehensive review on this scooter to help in your buying decision.",Suzuki
"I have been driving this scooter from more than 3 years.have taken this vehicle for long drive as well an average of my long drive trip is 400km, did not face any issues while driving, yes it's low on average compared to its rival Activa but better in performance.",Suzuki
"I have been mistreatment this scooter for six month and across. its performance is simply too sensible, finally there has been a competitor for honda activa. the appearance is cool and therefore the engine performance is incredibly price shopping for",Suzuki
"I have been purchased and I satisfied with the all comfort , power, fuel economy , style , handling .",Suzuki
"I have been purchased one and I satisfied with the all comfort_ power_ fueleconomy_ style., !",Suzuki
I have been riding with almost all types of vehicles for a decades and never experienced such issue with telescopic suspension and automatic clutch system.,Suzuki
"I have been the usage of this Suzuki get entry to given that two years and it’s one of the nice scooter I see on this section. And price is also very inexpensive relatively with other car. It costed me around 63k. Performance may be very high-quality however it just that mileage is bit much less while we compare it’s section car . Normally different vehicle on this phase costing bit greater like if we see activa. With a view to be price us greater than 65k but electricity is bit less, it’s 110 cc vehicle. Suzuki get admission to 125 is powered with 125cc. We can without difficulty convey heavy baggage’s on it and we never word lagging while using. Enough storage location is given in vehicle. All good with the automobile.",Suzuki
I have been using  Access for a year now. Mine is black color purchased from Baroda.,Suzuki
"I have been using Access 125 from past two months and being a fair costumer, I would like to share the experience that I have gone through. I bought this bike because of its amazing looks and its powerful engine. It has a variety of colours and all of them look exceptionally well on this bike. The sound of the engine is not soothing to ears but only reflects the power it has. It is comfortable to ride but it is difficult to take a U - turn with a person sitting behind. It gives a tough competition to India's No. 1 two wheeler company!",Suzuki
I have been using Access 125 since July 2013 and have rode around 7000 kms.,Suzuki
"I have been using Access for the last 5 years, bought in May 2008 from Dobro suzuki, Hyderabad, and travelled over 60, 000 kms on this vehicle only. As per me this is best for city and off road rides. I can see no other bike which is more reliable than this one.  I travel to my office and other places daily which is around 45 kms daily ride.",Suzuki
"I have been using Honda Activa for almost 5 years, I have used up to 72000 Km, all is well except the millage its 30 Km/lt. hence I felt to change over and try access125, I booked a vehicle by paying Rs.1000/- and after 4 months I got the delivery today from its dealer in Bangalore:Aerolex Motors Pvt.

"I have been using Suzuki Access 125 for 4 years.I got this scooter in 2014.Most people demands for the mileage but iam a person who loves the real power and thrust.So I choose access 125.About the mileage, company provides about 45 km per litre in 2014 but it has increased now with maintaining the 125 cc engine.Eventhough mileage is 45 for long distance running it is far more efficient.",Suzuki
"I have been using Suzuki Access 125 for more than 6 years. I really liked the pickup of the scooter. I have travelled atleast 100km a day I found it completely comfortable. As it is 125cc engine the mileage is approximately 45-50km per Liter. It has a amazing grip while traveling for short or long distance. One thing I found is that, it really costs alot when you go for servicing of the scooter, or else I would say maintance of the scooter",Suzuki
I have been using Suzuki Access 125 from last 1 one year it is very very wonderful the design is very good even for the boys and the girls It has good leg space so person like me 6 Foot 3 inch tall can sit comfortably . The mileage is also pretty good it can it can give you about your 42-45 kilometre per hour average mileage. 3 people can comfortably sit on it.,Suzuki
"I have been using Suzuki Access 125 from past 3 months. As the new customer to Suzuki yhey should update the customers for all the updates like RC received, Number received, Servicing dates like that. For Ex: For every new customer they will provide some free services and that dates to be confirmed by Service centers only. They hadn't informed us this at first. And when we went for servicing they told they will no be servicing now for that they had defined dates and for the first servicing we have to ride alteast 800 KMs, then we went back to home.",Suzuki
"I have been using access 125 from last 2 years, there are many pros and cons of access 125.",Suzuki
I have been using honda activa for 5 years from now and find it more powerful when it comes to pickup.,Suzuki
I have been using new access for about nine months now. I have used other scooters also but access is the one I prefer from now firstly is the performance and smoothness is very good and just feels so pleasant to use the throttle.the mileage is slightly less than the other scooters but it is not a big deal.i have ridden my cousins Activa 125 and I should say that I cannot find the kind of smoothness and quicker acceleration like in access in it. I definitely recommend access for those who want a family commuter.it fits perfectly as a family scooter,Suzuki
"I have been using old model of suzuki access 125. I have one of the best moped experiences with this. As far as regular maintenance is done, there is nothing it gets done . Reliability and comfort is great with pillion rider as well. Average is somewhere it lacks but it is acceptable after convincing ride quality. I need to suggest in one thing. If starter doesn't work, it is very hard to kick it as kick is placed near main stand. You have to pull whole moped on main stand and then you have to kick the scooter. For females, it is difficult to start with kick.",Suzuki
I have been using since a year.its the best bike I rode in all. I suggest u to buy this without any second thought.before buying I have reasearched in many sites and showrooms more than three months.later I regretted why I wasted lot of time in searching but finally got the best bike,Suzuki
"I have been using suzuki access 125 since 2017. I am getting good mileage and it's weight also fine 102 kg. Very comfortable to ride. It's front brake is disc type and has alloy wheels. Maintenance cost is also low. As per my opinion the scooter main defect is headlamp always working, it's light connection directly connected to the engine. Other defect is center stand, we can't operate kicker without holding center stand. It's very difficult for ladies.",Suzuki
I have been using suzuki access for 3 years I think access is the best two wheeler vehicle.access is having a great mialage and good material is used in manufacturing.it comes in many colours as well I am having the grey one so I would like to say access is the scooter at its best I can give it 5 stars without any doubt.??????,Suzuki
I have been using suzuki access for more than 3 years and the maintaince problem is very less only main problem was with the speedometer cable whivh gets broken many times. Overall the bike has good looks as well the performance is unbeatable with great pickup and the main thing the average you get is only in range of 40 - 45 kmph/l. I have two access the old and new model has powerful engine light weight and the front tyre is bigger than the rear one which makes a problem of sliping on turns. Thats all but its really worth the money. I still use suzuki access for long rides that means only trustworthy vehicles are used for lond rides and its trust qorthy.,Suzuki
"I have been using suzuki access scooty since 5 years and like to confess thats its overall results are really appreciable, 125 cc power engine make your ride powerful whereas in other scooty such as activa they had given 110 cc engine. Its showroom price is high as compared to other normal scooty, it is 70, 000+ whereas activas and Jupiter's price is 65, 000+ . I found it nice because it provide almost good mileage of 50 to 55 in city, I would like to say that if you are looking for a powerful scooter than this is best option than you will find anywhere else.",Suzuki
I have been using suzuki access since two and a half year. for one and half year I did not faced any problem bu now this scooty have started giving problem. I am using 128 cc version of this scooty which very good. even I would say it is great scooty. two best thing I like about this scooty is that this scooty got a great to speed and excellent acceleration.,Suzuki
"I have been using suzuki acess125 from last four years.when I passed my 10th I got this as a gift.in this segment having 125cc is mouth watering combination for the people how love speed, pick up, and reliability. Even if you load the vehicle with more than 150kgs also never had any trouble with speed and pickup.",Suzuki
"I have been using the new suzuki access 125 ( standard edition) since last 9 months. To begin with this sccoter is stylish and appealing and together with excellent road grip and comfortable handling, it makes riding a wonderful experience, I have been getting mileage between 40-45 kmpl consistently. Its engine is powerful ( suzuki is known for that) , plus the storage sections ( specially near the the legspace) is super convenient. It includes socket for charging devices as well. All in all it deserves the scooter of the year award.Things to note: 1. If your height is below 5.5, your legs might not reach the road.2. The button via which the digital meter is accessed is very losoe and can be taken out easily.",Suzuki
"I have been using the scooter from last 5 months , and untill now I donot have to face even a single problem and its quite nice to say .",Suzuki
"I have been using the suzuki access 125 since nearly past 3 years must say the experience cannot be shared under these walls of the internet .Its not just the mere experience but an memory the scooter has surely payed off me the cost I payed for it .It consists of a 125cc engine with a decentmileage of 35 kmpl as least decent in accordance to my way of riding the scooter .In city traffic mainly the scooter behaves very well the power it tends to deliver is the best and appropriate .The maintenance cost of the scooter too isnt that expensive I would say just the regular servicing may keep the scooter going? I totally recommend the scooter for the family or individual who commutes through city traffic and wants a trusted brand with a refined engine.This was my experience with my old access 125 and I also recently bought the newer version and I must say this moped is beyond words the instrument cluster, tubeless tyres, more refined engine it old version multiplied by 2 .LOADS OF LOVE TO THIS SMALL 125cc SCOOTER",Suzuki
"I have been using this Suzuki access since two years and it's one of the best scooter I see in this segment. And price is also very cheaper comparatively with other vehicle. It costed me around 63k. performance is very nice but it just that mileage is bit less when we compare it's segment vehicle . Usually other vehicle in this segment costing bit more like if we see activa. That will be cost us more than 65k but power is bit less, it's 110 cc vehicle. Suzuki access 125 is powered with 125cc. we can easily Carry heavy luggage's on it and we never notice lagging while riding. Enough storage place is given in vehicle. All good with the vehicle.",Suzuki
I have been using this bike for one year.but with in days there have been a lot of complaints.Some times it has a starting problem and its brake is immediately complaining.The desingns and model of access 125 is very good looks.And it's runnig is smooth and it has good pullup.but there are become lots of complaints,Suzuki
I have been using this bike from last 1 year.i give looks 5/5.i give control 3/5 becz.the handle and seat alighment is not so good wat I like the most about bike is pick up is just great becz it has 125 cc engine,Suzuki
I have been using this bike last three years but it is very high on its maintenance. As it has fiber body its strong but tyres dont have grip more over it vibrates a lot. Fuel consumption is also too much.,Suzuki
"I have been using this bike since 2017. I am getting a good mileage and its weight also is fine 102 kgs. Very comfortable to ride. Its front brake is disc typeand has alloy wheels. Mintenence cost is also low. As per my opinion this scooters main defect is headlamp always working, its light connection is directly connected to engine. Other defect is centre stand, we cannot operate kicker without holding center stand. t is difficult for the ladies.",Suzuki
"I have been using this scooter around of 4 years. I am in Real Estate Marketing guy and have to travel a lot. I have already passed 40, 000 kms on my bike. My experience is extremely good and suggested around 15 people to buy this scooter and almost every people is very satisfied with this vehicle.",Suzuki
I have been using this scooter for past 3 years. Pick up is good. Control is good. But this year I had to get the engine work to be done because of Air filter bursted in rainy season. Now I have spent more than 20000 Rs. But still there is not guarantee that it will be OK for more than 2 months.,Suzuki
"I have been using this scooty for more than 6 years. I have 3 scooties right now. All are Access 125. The main thing I like this scooty is it's pickup, speed and mileage. A rear combination you would see in other brand. Moreover, Availability of service centers make it easy to get service done anywhere in India.",Suzuki
"I have been using this scoter for 6 month and across. its performance is too good, at last there hass been a compitior for honda activa.the looks is cool and the engine performance is very worth buying",Suzuki
"I have black access 125 cc its been 1.5 years i'm using this scooter, it gives great mileage, the performance of access 125 is very good.",Suzuki
"I have bought Suzuki Access 125, in November 2009. It was was waste of hard earn money. In first six month seepdometer failed then going forward battery then rust in iron rod.Twice clutch bearing failed all in daily 40 km running. In three and a half years I have spend around 10 to 15 thousand Rupees.",Suzuki
"I have bought a Suzuki Access over Honda Activa, Dio, Maestro, Pleasure etc.I have gone through technicalities and reviews before buying.Most of them are 110cc and average  mileage  is 40-45, but when it comes to Access its 125cc.",Suzuki
I have bought access suzuki 125 which is old model.i bought 3 years ago in rupee 55000 + insurance will be extra.,Suzuki
I have bought an Access 125 about 20 days ago.........& I have completed 930 km running.........from Kothrud Suzuki inWarje pune........After a waiting for about 1.5 months which was simply uncontrollable I got skyblue colour of this AEROPLANE.,Suzuki
I have bought around 5 years ago it works same as 5years ago powerful engine and best scooter from other scooter and pick up is very powerful I love this scooter,Suzuki

I have bought this scooty 1 year ago its a very good but needs a lot of maintenance and servies. The main thing that I liked it that it was very powerful 125cc scooty and I like the pick up of this scooty very much. The average is quite good and the looks wise it I more better then other company scooties and I liked the most this scooty ?,Suzuki
I have bought this vehicle from Bangalore Airport Road Suzuki when Suzuki launched it in 2007.(Delivery in Nov /Dec 2007).,Suzuki
I have clocked 10000 km on this scooter and this review is based on that good and also a little bad experience with this scooter only. First the good- Mileage is very good as I have been getting 40/50 km per liter but with specific riding style. Second- The comfort-Long and wide seat with right seating position provide immensely good riding quality and comfort. The long floor board also ensure that your foot are placed comfortably and it also allows to carry things easily between it. MRF Tubeless Tyres ensure good grip and let your scooter stick to the road properly.,Suzuki
"I have come across many access owners praising the power it delivers, but i would not compromise my fuel money on this piece of crap just for extra power, the Activa gives decent power at least.",Suzuki
I have completed above 10000 kilometers and it does't affect anything on a scooter I have a long road trips also but I think the scooter is very good and the seat is very comfortable .,Suzuki
I have decided to buy a scooter for me and my wife to but confused in Suzuki access. It is cheaper than others but many of the reviews are not good.,Suzuki
"I have done 2 free services but average & performance was not good. Then i have given my access for 3 rd paid servicing. After servicing in the evening, i travel for 1 km, i am unable to start my access by button or kick. I have called in shiv autoriders but nobody has lifted my phone. Next day they have done servicing & my access started.",Suzuki
I have driven this vehicle on highway (NH8) and on city interiors and even in subzi markets. Only small thing is the lack of comfort from shock absorbers when only one person is sitting. Otherwise the ride has been quite good.,Suzuki
I have experience because I have both Activa and Suzuki Access but I like Activa much then Suzuki Access.,Suzuki
I have experience with this ridiculious product.suzuki access 125 have lot of mantanance for 20 days. Its pivk up is waste and control of scoty is fail.,Suzuki
"I have had kinetic hondas for last 17 years( 2 of them) and they never broke down on roads with out warning. This suzuki breaks down despite alternate month service by apple auto. The standard answer by suzuki is, please get the vehicle we will service it.",Suzuki
"I have heard some of them are not even getting average mileage, practically what I observed in this vehicle is, try not to exceed speed 40km/h . I was also not getting an average mileage, I was getting around 37km/l in Hyderabad traffic with pillion . In this heavy traffic it takes 50mins to travel 17kms in hyderabad. I tried and drove the vehicle not exceeding speed 40km/h, now I am getting 41km/l.",Suzuki
I have just completed one year with my Suzuki Access 125. It is a very good scooty which comes with easy handling and the texture of the scooty is very smooth and eye catching. Though I have striked it once or twice bt it was not that much noticable and after I got it serviced it serves me as it is new with it's amazing performance. It also doesn't need that much of petrol to survive on. I must say it is the best scooty in today's era with the minimum amount of expenses on it.,Suzuki
"I have my own Access 125 bike I like this bike because of good pick up, fuel Consumption, average weight than activa bike comfortable to go I am driving its since last 7-8 Years nice bike by Suzuki all good for handling, nice space for Ur luggage, and every thing thank u Suzuki for a nice bike.",Suzuki
"I have my own Suzuki Access 125 for lost 18 months. it's look vey good and light weight vehicle. it's seat so long so we feel comfortable. It's run very smooth and one of the gearless motel . There was sufficient power at all speed. Starting from paint quality pastiches used, electric parts, switches everything is good.i like Suzuki Access 125 vehicle. I like this product.",Suzuki
I have my own in red colour. having 6 litre fuel tank capacity is enough for me. Daily I used to visit my farm which is located 20 km away from my house. worth to buy this scooty I am also planning to buy one more for my brother.,Suzuki
I have my own suzuki accsess 125 for last 2 years. It's good and very lightweight vehicle. Its look so good. Its pickup is good. its parfect scooter. Its seat so long so we feel very comfortabl. We easily seat 3 person. Very comfortable foot seat. Stering height is good . Most important thing is it's look so good or cool,Suzuki
"I have never ride activa, so I cannot compare it with access in terms of riding styles.",Suzuki
"I have no regrets at all about decision rather whenever I Ride this bike I feel a sense of happiness Anybody who is interested in buying a scooter, I will suggest go for a test ride of Suzuki Access 125. With my honest opinion this bike really worth for a 5 Star Rating in all respects. I feel Suzuki should use aggresive marketing Strategy to push it more in Market.",Suzuki
"I have not checked the fuel efficiency numbers yet, but anything around or near 50 KMPL will be good for me. Have been through the first service and it was a pleasant experience. The total cost of service was 270 rupees and the scoot feels little more smooth now.",Suzuki
"I have owned a suzuki access 125 moped with maroon colour outlook. But its not having the any of the godd attitude look, it is the moped with very low milege, also it has the huge price , the access 125 moped engine also use to make the more sound as compare to other moped vehicles, also it does have a vibration problems, as the moped once go more than the speed of 60 kmph it decreases the balancing and faces some kind of vibration, also the bike does not have the alloy tyres which the company has not mentioned , overall I dont like the much of its performance.",Suzuki
"I have owned this scooty 3 years back and what I feel from my experience is that it is the best scooty in terms of function, features, mileage and performance.",Suzuki
"I have possessed this scooty 3 years back and what I feel from my experience is that it is the best scooty as far as capacity, elements, mileage and execution. The smooth outline makes it extremely agreeable for lengthy drive and the speed it spreads is incredible. Comes in different shading choices, you don't need to limit your decision to high contrast shading as it were. It is outfitted with support free battery, tubeless tire and focal locking framework. The parts are effectively accessible and give extraordinary execution in great cost",Suzuki
I have purcashed Access 125 on Diwali. I purchased it from PAYTM which gave me 5000 cashback. Best in speed and performace. Avg is also the best. 45 to 50 kmpl depends on the speed. If you drive in economic i.e 40 to 50 speed you will get best avg. It is spaces and comfortabe for daily. One of the best thing is charging port in the bike.,Suzuki
"I have purchase Suzuki Access 125 . I love that scooter . that scooter is only use nothing for me my sister, my mother and brother also use. that handling very easily and smoothly .

I have very impresed with color combination and look of the suzuki access. its look prety good.the lower seat storage it open at the key side so its advantageous for me because I dont need to plug-in and plug-out my key many time so I like this features of suzuki access.The breaking control of suzuki is very good whenever I want to stop it gives perfect responce. but little bit maintainace is ver high of this vehical I have to change lyner in just four month so its very costly to maintain it. the seat of ths vehical is very soft I cant getting tired with long journey .pick-up is amazing very good to go ahead in trafic.who have pilles problem, back problem, another etc I really suggest it cause the comfort of access is very good. its decent for older as well as younger, so every one go for it who do not care about maintainance anf fuel efficiency.",Suzuki

"I have purchased a Suzuki access in 2011 from Panchkula . It’s Worst scooter, worst product by Suzuki. From the start date of bought it gives me trouble always. The scooter self start is not working, scooter stopped automatically while running, lots of sound before 10 months ago. and the service center of Suzuki Panchkula employees not able to sort out the problem and not responding properly it seems as they are untrained. They have changed 5-6 batteries, charger, charging wire, lock in between 2-3 months, even which was already working but they changed, don’t why they did this?",Suzuki
"I have purchased a suzuki access 125 model and is my favourite, it is a very comfortable ride and is affordable. It has a good mileage and provides hassle free rides. It has a unique design and is a comfort to eyes as well. The seating is wide and long enough and has storage under seating which is accessible from the ignition. It has an analog speedometer and digital fuel meter. It also has an easy start system which is very comfortable. Overall a great one which provides comfort riding.",Suzuki

Local mileage-40-42km/l, high way-52km/l, waste head lighting, very bad front suspension, seating for rider is hectic, cheap tool kit, self starter troubles in morning and gaps of usage,  showroom personals don't tell u about battery maintenance and its weak points.",Suzuki

I have purchased this scooter few weeks back and it meets my expectation to be a best scooter,Suzuki
I have purchased this scooty 2 years back and according to my experience its the best scooty in performance and in mileage the best thing I like in this scooty is its design its very comfortable for long journey.,Suzuki
I have purchased this scooty before a month and I dont like this I have activa before I have purchaed it and I will say that activa I far better than access fuel consumption is around 25 l/iter scoty is comfortable handling and control is not good of this bike looks are normal but not so good I will recommed you not buy this bike go and purchase honda activa . acitva is far better than this bike handling and control and fuel consumption is better of active,Suzuki
I have recently bought access 125 and using it since about 45 days and not a single problem found yet. It give good average about 59 kmpl in new condition. Its new engine is better then older one. If you are confused about which is better among access 125 and activa 4g(because these two are most trending now a days) then I will recommend access.,Suzuki
I have recently brought this machine.Looks very cool and design wise matured with predecessor.Engine is quiet good compared with Activa 125CC.It is very well refined  engine and power.Millage  it will cross more than 40 in city and Highway not yet tested.It is very comfortable for small family and busy traffic. Large boot space and floor.Now BSIV model comes with always on headlight and Park light.Suspension is very nice and little soft not much harder.,Suzuki
I have recently owned Access 125 Silver colour and I am totally satisfied by its performance.,Suzuki
"I have repaired its Clutch Parts 3 times  and get the service the vehicle, now also it has very noises inside and outside Engine.",Suzuki
"I have ridden all the scooters including the Activa 125 and I find it baffling when Activa 125 is put up as a competitor to the Access 125! It is totally a mismatch! The Activa 125 may have a 125 cc engine but it doesn't act or feel like one! I find it totally ridiculous that the Activa 125 and the Access 125 are put in the same bracket. In reality, the Access 125 is the truly superior scooter and blows away most of the competition. Only the TVS Ntorq and Suzuki Burgeman are superior to the Access 125.",Suzuki
"I have ridden at high speeds all the way to Mahabaleshwar and back. Scooter touched 100 and I constantly drove at speeds not less than 70. Scooter handles so well on the highways, that my friend who was riding pulsar 180 was embarrassed. That, along with the comfortable front and back seats means no back pain at all. No stiffness, not even a twitch.",Suzuki
"I have rode Activa and did like it but the Suzuki Access just swept me off my feet, The look, style, mileage, comfort, handling is just awesome!!!!!I did see quite a bad review here before I buy but guys trust me this is so good!!!If your planning to get one for your GF, wife or even for yourself then go for this!!!",Suzuki
I have seen people posting negative reviews here for acess 125. Its not that bad a scooter. If a 125 cc engine gives 50-55 that's great. I have ridden activa and I was not impressed.,Suzuki
I have shown it to different mechanics also but damaged was done by service center. I am regret of my dicision of purchasing this scooter suzuki access. I recommend each and everyone for not to prefer this scooter as it may not live upto your expectation and would be a very difficult and horrible experience for everyone.,Suzuki
I have shown many mechanic but everyone says nobody guarantee suzuki access repair work. It has highest maintaince cost.,Suzuki
"I have spend more than 10, 000 Rs on the vehicles engine. And after one month it again creates the same problem, very heavy smoke, lots of sound and unable to start the engine .",Suzuki
"I have spend more than 10, 000 Rs on these problems but didn’t get the solution YET. Mechanics don’t know properly what is the exact problem. Now when I called them then again they want to change the battery.",Suzuki
I have suzuki access 125 I always face starting problem in access many time lot of attempt then access is on suzuki access not for long distance I face starting problem when I go to long distance that why I dislike suzuki access125 service of suzuki access is very bad and delay in my area very bad .,Suzuki
"I have suzuki access 125 as well as honda activa.Access 125 rocks, it has awesome pickup and has smooth riding, feels like driving car with very less noise.",Suzuki
"I have suzuki access 125 for past 10 years, it's a good buy. But only to those who don't have money issues, who hates speeding. In terms of mileage it will give between 40-45 kmpl in the first 5 years only if you service it well and on time. after than the mileage will drop to even 30 kmpl. It has 125 cc engine which will provide you pickup more then activa and a petrol tank of 6 liter. comfort level is good and can be taken for long rides. Reliability is not a question, so don't worry about it. Road grip is good but guys it's a scooty it will have small tires you can't do anything about it, I recommend do not expect much in terms of grip. Appeal wise it is bold, powerful, and attractive.",Suzuki
"I have suzuki access 125. Fuel consumption average is 50 to 55kmpl but company has said its 65kmpl. It is too low.

"I have taken Suzuki access 125 on April-2016 from credit pee Suzuki Sulthan Batheri, Wayanad.After 2 months they call back the vehicle to show room and change its shaft.Before the shaft was changed a week ago, a sound came from within the rear wheel.I told the problem to the showroom and they had it done.Vut in two day, it was damaged again. Now it's done six times, but after a few days it's damaged again. Now I'm going to move legally. This is not just a problem vibration, getting more sound from engine and also very pure mileage it gives around 30 kmpl are the another problems. These were lot of customers in the same problems as there was not only my scooter. In this situation, so it would better not to take this vehicle.",Suzuki
"I have taken Suzuki access 125 on February 2017 in Avanish motors Vijayanagara Bangalore.this model bike have several problems like vibration, getting more sound in engine and also very poor mileage it gives around 30 KMPL. As of now 2 services are completed but still facing above mentioned problems.the same I have informed to Suzuki access service center they said like once cross more than 5000KM then will get pickup. In my experience and suggest to u guys don't go and buy this kind of bikes.",Suzuki
"I have taken the blue colour, which was liked the most by both myself and my wife. The delivery time taken was 3 days from the date of booking, that too only because the blue and silver colours were not available at that time. Had it been grey, black or red, I could have got the delivery on the spot itself.",Suzuki
"I have tanked lone, I am thinking that bank work vl take more time..",Suzuki
I have these model in Metallic Gold color and its nice in usage the weight is not so more as compare to bikes and activa,Suzuki
I have this bike since last 4 months.one thing I dislike about it is its bad looks which needs to be improved but its mileage is very good 55kmpl for 1 litre.thats worth the money.,Suzuki
I have this scooty from 4 years and believe me it's engine is as good as it was 4 years back by the way I don't like scooters but when my father brought this I was very disappointed but when I drives this for first time I was thinking like that I am driving a sports bike I mean it's pickup and engine power is so good it's mileage is awesome me and my friends always make our funtime with my access it has become a part of my life and its condition is so good even today,Suzuki
"I have this vehicle since over a year now.  I must mention it's best in market.  May it be looks,  performance,  power,  comfort, handling, it aces all these fields.",Suzuki
I have to agree that in india suzuki offers best 125cc scooters in low budget. Still it has got a major drawback. The self start button in new access scooters doesnt work properly. It becomes very difficult for a customer to start the vehicle when they are in a hurry. Everytime they have to kickstart the vehicle now and then.,Suzuki
I have to wait for this ...no other option I have....but if u r taking this bike just ask them I after how many years vl they give u8 the bike,Suzuki
"I have told this problem to service center many times, but however they have no solution.",Suzuki
"I have tried a lot of two wheelers in the market, but this particular vehicle is totally amazing. It has a very good pickup when compared to other vehicles of that sort and also comes within my budget. Its also provides good milage despite of being 125 cc engime. But for the first two to three months you will have to compromize the milage but after three services, the milage will be increased. You will also get mobile charging port in the vehicle which is very user friendly. The vehicle is very attractive and comes with chromed head lamps and also mirrors. It has got comparitively large tires than other scooters which gives a good riding experience. Overall its a very good scooter!",Suzuki
"I have used Kinetic then Honda Activa. In both scooters I didnt get the power I always feel lack of power in crowded areas & took lots of load pressure to drive in rushy area, but in Suzuki Access Pick up is so great that im fond of this Scooter especially in traffic, A it gives me excellent milleage of 50 kms. Its Value for money. I ve done 5 or 6 th service and the dealing of the dealer is very excellent. I got all the help tips regarding my vehical from the dealer. I strongly recomend that every body should prefer Suzuki Access.",Suzuki
I have used this bike and this is alsothe most commen two wheeler used by the people in my area.,Suzuki
I have useing access 125 the pickup of scooter is much more better than the another scooter.,Suzuki
"I heard that it would give good milege up to 40 to 50, i am only getting up to 31 after 4th service .back pain while driving bad roads in cities if it falls into small potholes it hurts a lot .but it is quite ok in good roads, i dont about high ways drive.barking is not up to mark they should gone for disc brake.engine power is good.but i wont recommed it no no na na na",Suzuki
I heard the Scotty is not so nice. It is write that it is a big brand but in truth the Scotty is not so good. On one hand the Scotty give well mileage and is very comfortable. But on other hand the Scotty is not nice looking and assome. According to my suggestion you should not buy it. According to its price there are no well features.,Suzuki
I hope this will help you in decide whether to go for this scooter or not.,Suzuki

"I knew about Suzuki access moped bike it's good drive and comfort and well designed as well as features, it's help to carry little materials also on that bike, fuel consumption is(kms/litre) 50-55 average, easily control, looks good, smooth engine, quickly start, and advanced, riding with comfort and I prefer to others buy Suzuki access BIKE because without gear go fast with comfort and reliability, looks good, sounds good",Suzuki

I like the blue color is very look good. I like the mobile charger port is new feature in this scooter.,Suzuki
I like the steel body of this scooter I don't like the head lamp old scooter is better look in terms of head lamp. I like the engine power and this scooter reach 0-60in only 7 sec I like this very much.,Suzuki

"I like this bike Its an amazing Bike, Finally someone brought something that the Pakistani Youth can enjoy . Previously Katara Bikes like Honda never even thought about changing the design, they could have even brought some new tech but noo. current companies rule over Pn by keeping their pre historic designs and charging them alot of money. I am Glad Yamaha brought alot of features. I myself Love it. Self Starter is amazing. Great suspension and awesome features. my friends like this bike",Suzuki

"I love suzuki access 125 because of it smoothness in driving Fuel consumption is good but its not as prescibed by the company it gives around 40kmpl as per my calculations. This is heavy and very confortable, as compared to activa aviator and some of other bikes, suzuki access 125 is the best in its confort line This bike goes very smoothly with a very low negotiable engine sound, it rides so smoothly that one passing through this bike will not understand wheather yhe bike is on or off. Handling and control is quite good as cpmpared to others. It looks fantastic, the new access 125 has very classic look with amazing design. So finally I recommend people to go for this nice one.",Suzuki
"I love the Access 125 the best when it comes into its character and settles into a steady growl at 60 Kms. Its competitors struggle to breathe at the same speed. It has given my a mileage of 37.6 Kms/Ltr. This is before the first servicing. Post which, I expect it to touch atleast 45 Kms/Ltr. My friend has a Mahindra Rodeo, but he however, after sitting pillion on my bike prefers my Access!!!",Suzuki
I love this . I bought this scooter by loan . This is very comfortable . When I am drive this then I am feel very comfortable . The sit is long then 2 or 3 members are sit on it . The grip of this vehicle is good . The performance of this vehicle is to good . It can pickup a speed of 60kmph in just 5 seconds . Shock absorbers are good that it does not make us experience any shock or any other conditions,Suzuki

I m driving this scooter from  15 days and found the following,Suzuki
I m recomended to all costomers to buy this bike. Without any thinking . All paisa wasul.,Suzuki
I m using access from last four years.it gives good smooth ride.but very bad in terms of average it gives merely average of 30-35 kmpl,Suzuki
I m using suzuki access 125 and its very expensive as I spent more money in it maintainence mileage is also not  gud its too low its required a highly maintainnence service  have to change oil in every week n its  headlight also start shivering n self start problem sometime its get on the road and accelerate problem.,Suzuki
"I m using this Suzuki access 125 from 7 months and I m totally satisfied from grip, sitting, comfortable, and material used in it. This scooter runs very smoothly and fine which I like the most it has digital meter of petrol, km reading, and oil change alert which is pretty nice.",Suzuki
"I managed a FE of 35kpl with two people on board and a 80% highway riding while maintaining speeds above 70kph for most of the time. I'd say that's pretty good for a 125cc scooter, I owned a Yamaha Gladiator 125 which returned me an average FE of 40kmpl on highways, so being an automatic, this FE wasn't bad at all.",Suzuki
I managed to ride a road test it stands auto expo and engine power is awesome.  Iowned a suzuki access can I tell top three selling scotter.,Suzuki
"I may not suggest persons who have ladies in their house to purchase this vehicle if this is the only vehicle, but if they have a substitute vehicle they are always welcome to purchase it, atleast its better than Activa in pickup, mileage is overrall ok with min 40km per ltr.",Suzuki
"I mean this is insane for a non-gear vehicle he travels minimum of 40 km per day and what does he expect I would say Indian maker TVS JUPITER is far better than any other non-gear vehicle in the market so far, it gives a minimum of 50 kmpl and the service cost is also affordable, and TVS performs better than Suzuki access.So close your eyes and go for it.",Suzuki
"I must say its the best. ive been using this bike for about an year now and I have not faced a single issue.the best thing I like about this bike is its smoothness and comfortability its just super smooth.and another must mention propety is its power.it has a great power and pickup I think it has the top pickup in gear less bikes.fuel comsuption is also managable, its ok but you know power cost fuel.and it also has good looks white is my favorite .and it also has good handeling and controll.so if you are thinking to get one of this dont hesitate.good luck",Suzuki
I myself own a black access.and race it to 70;).its got really good mileage.it gives me upto 48 kmpl.Quite good.At least better than'ACTIVA'.!.Its just 1 thing I feel sad about in this vehicle.the material worth which it is made is good enough but it makes the front mudguard a lil heavy.and it makes the vehicle a bit hard to handle at very low speds.other than this no cons from my side .:) im happy I chose it.!,Suzuki
"I never been long distances though. I like the bike in many accepts like pick up, shocks, riding stability.",Suzuki
"I never considered Activa, because of comfort reasons. I never considered the Mahindra vehicles, as they were formerly Kinetic and the review for even Flyte in the long run didn't go well at all. Even for Scooty Pep+ or Streak, I didn't give it a choice as I have to travel 60 kms up and down everyday using the vehicle, and hence I was looking for a higher CC, for better power and pickup. The only advantage with Scooty was that it was light weight and my wife could comfortably handle it.",Suzuki
"I never face any major issues and concerns. Just few here and there small concerns, but it's OK it's a Machine. It has good pickup, till the time I used to get the my bike to get start in 1 attempt only.",Suzuki
I never look Suzuki Access 125 as a first rate vehicle due to its too many unaccepted fallacious attributes.,Suzuki
I never recommended this scooter for any body because  of my Bad experience for service and bad engine never solved problems. I Sold this Scooter in just 35000Rs after one and a half year of when ever I paid 59000 thousand for it. Its a bad deal for me.,Suzuki
I never satisfied because of its service center specially HIMMATNAGAR in GUJARAT. I always want to complain about this service center but I don't know where I complain but access is better for riding. u feel quit better than Activa. I got it in 2010 but still it run far better. The problem which I face is its maintenance.,Suzuki
I now prefer the scooter more than my car for moving out due to the sheer pleasure derived by driving this & of course for the convenience n economy it offers. My wife is still learning & hopefully will do her duty alone after a couple of weeks.,Suzuki
I now use Castrol API 4 GL gear oil. This has significantly reduced the whirring noise from the belt and gears at speeds above 40.,Suzuki
I now use Shell Advanced fully synthetic 10W40. Price is Rs 650. Lasts 3000 KMS but I change it every 2000 KMS.,Suzuki
"I opted for standard accessory set with pricetag of Rs 1, 940. It includes the following:",Suzuki
"I own Suzuki access 125 Limited edition Black variant with brown seat. There are few things I like about this scooter, the look of this scooter is really attractive made it little old style with crome headlights and crome mirrors which gives a dope look. Fuel capacity is more as compared to activa. Seat is now much broader and bigger and is very nice and comfortable, cushion is very comfy. It has disc brake in the front which makes braking very strong and reliable, no matter at what speed you are when you apply brakes scooter slows down immediately without any hassling or fearing of falling down. Pick up is also very good as compared to other scooters I ride. There is good amount of leg space which makes seating very easy and you can stuff bags, small boxes etc. In all I have a good experience with this scooter and I enjoy every ride with it. I will recommend this to buy.",Suzuki
I own a access 125 from suzuki from the last 6 years.  I must say that the vehicle is amazing and nothing short of a gem.,Suzuki
"I own a access of your company, and I have noted that customers are been looted in the name of free service, I have got my 2nd service this month and noticed that saying free service, I have been charged 440 Rs. on 1st service I was been charged 510 Rs. what it is meant by free service.",Suzuki
"I own a bike access 125, (model 2008), I ran for almost 24000 kms. I had a complaint where my bike stops at slower speeds and so last week I gave my bke to service center people. Later when I went back for picking it up I was told that my bike needs some engine overhauling. But I asked not to do anything. So I want your help on this.",Suzuki
I own sizuki access two year ago from then access is going very good I never face any major problem in it.this is a low maintenance bike.,Suzuki
I own the scooter access for myself . The red colour is a very charming colour. I can run this scooter even if the meter is about to touch the empty side. Very fuel efficent scooter. The power is just amazing helps to overtake the cars and bikes easily and I could overtake all the other scooters. It looks very good. The scooter is fiber so its light weight which helps for the power. The maintenance is cheap suzuki has made a great scooter in terms of maintenance. In my opinion it has no negatives.,Suzuki
I own this Two wheeler back from 3 years and still the performance is good. The mileage is also good around 45 kmpl while driving in city and now refined engine models have come offering 60 kmpl of mileage.,Suzuki
"I own two of these since 8 years. I also used others in this segment like activa and jupiter but foud this one the best among all. It has got the best pickup, lowest time to reach from 0 to 60 nice and smooth engine and I love everything about it. It also has very low maintainance cost I take it to workshop every 6 monthes for oil change and it costs about 500 to 600 for full servising of the vehicle. Its milage is also very good but this depends a lot on your driving condition . I drive it very softly and it easily gives me around 45 to 50 kmpl.",Suzuki
"I owned access 125 almost one year back. It's giving me a decent mileage of 43-50 kmpl and an average of 45kmpl. I think that's good for this kind of vehicle. It gives me good stability till 65km/h. But when speed exceeds 65km, vehicle tends to loose control.",Suzuki
"I owned this scooter from about 3 years. my experiance I share with you. milage of this scooter very bad in city or at long drive.maintainance of this scooter is high than other scooter. I have many times problem in engine . I spent more than 5000 thousand at a time. In my scooter block piston problem, oil leakage problem, it does not take race of accelerator many times. road grip is good and plus point. pick up and speed is best about it. comfortable in seating and driving",Suzuki
"I payed entire 51, 080 on the 1st day of booking, and had to wait for 34days for delivery. Registration had been done.",Suzuki
"I personallly find this scooter very comfortable as I am 5: 10 feet, but this scooty can be a problem for short riders as it is a bit tall scooter when compared to scooters like activa.I have buyied the bs IV model from the local showroom .It weights only 102 kgs have metals on its front part and on its mud guard, seats are quite comfortable, it has a bit longer seat which is very very comfortable to sit for longer journeys, it has a chrome finished headlights which are good, suspensions are very good we won't find difficulties in indian road conditions, it has also got a nice ground clearance.If we talk about the pickup then for pick up it is the best scooter in terms for pick up we can reach 60kmph in just about 7-8 secs and the milage is also good for 125cc scooter it gives around 50kmpl and the top speed is 85kmphr.Here are the things that I like about this scooter ( personal opinion) 1. good top speed2. Value for money3. Long seat which is very comfortable4. Good hadling5. Classic look6. Light weight7. Large under seat storageCons ( IMO) 1. Sometimes the front part vibrates while giving the accelerate after braking2. Not for short riders ( they will face difficulties while riding it) I am personally using this scooter for now 11 monts and I fell that it is very good scooter",Suzuki
I personally have been using the Access 125 for over a month now and I feel that this might as well be one of the best scooter in the indian moped industry.,Suzuki
I personally owned the vehicle and it's no words to say about this scooter its really fast in speed good pick up power good comfort its international brand good parts but little costly but a good scooter.must go with it.,Suzuki
I personally prefer to buy this scooter only compared to anyother.,Suzuki
"I personally purchased this vehicle 3 years back.till now I am not satisfied with this bike. I have already spent more than rs 10000 for maintenance.it conumes more petrol. normally its spare parts are not available(original).when I have visited its authorised spare parts center, they will sy, spare part are not available.as compared to honda activa, it is not good at all.now I want to sell it, but its second hand market value is very low",Suzuki
I personally recommended to you check other scoter like activa and other before buy this,Suzuki
"I personally use this access 125 its a great piece of machine its fuel efficient and very comfortable its handling is to easy and its look is stuning and also its a suzuki's bike, so its reliable . I personally recommend it. its control is also very good and its consumption of fuel is also very less. it gives mileage of 50 km per litre. it has disc brakes which makes it more protective in taffic areas",Suzuki
"I personally use this by about 1.5 years ago it is good bike it, about 60 to 70 mile in one litre petrol Sometime if you use it in the town so I think it cover about 50 to 55 meal in a 1 litre petrol because when we stop and drive the lot of petrol is wasted due to this reason it It cover small distance in the town.",Suzuki
"I personally used this by about 1.5 years ago it is good bike it, about 60 to 70 mile in one litter petrol.",Suzuki
"I personally used this scooter for 3 months. But it gave me a very bad experience. On the style and design side it looks very good. But it is not durable at all, it picked up many scratches. On the performance side was even worse. Its acceleration is not so good and camt even tolerate accelerating fast and fluctuates its speed. This also results in bad milage and goves only 35-40 kmpl milage. Tje opening of the fuel cap is alao a problem as it will not open at any cost at the time needed. Also the vehicles wobbles and vibrates if you speed up over 40kmpl heading to a harsh noise. The brakes also did not work well. Forget about the servicing. The customer care is also pathetic.",Suzuki
I plan to buy the new activa or Dio soon to get rid of this pain in the back.,Suzuki
I plan to use API 5 GL gear oil when this can is over. It should be make the drive smoother.,Suzuki
I prefer old people to use this bike very comfortable.maintainance is also easy.,Suzuki
I puchased my bike 1 year ago and till now there is no big problems with this bike,Suzuki
"I purchase Suzuki Access 125 before 20 days .  And all thing is good but the mileage is very less about 20 kmpl.  And bike dealer says "" It will give mileage of 40-45 kmpl"" Now I am very disappointed with this Suzuki Access.",Suzuki

"I purchased Suzuki Access 125 recently. I booked the Access by making full payment at the time of booking and had to wait for ~ 40 Days!! But after owning the Access, I feel its all worth it :) Undoubtfully Access is the best in class scooter.

"I purchased Suzuki access in January 2015. In the starting off drive this moped it feels good. But after some times it's problem get started. access make big noise when it will start, In the winter every day one big problem occurs, access doesn't start, as we keep trying then it will start after 5 to 10 min. when we talk about fuel consumption it was take so many fuel. Access 125 give near by 40 km/l, I will check millage 3 times. it's handling was good in the average speed like 50 km/h, but when you try to drive more then handing was little bit complicated. At that time some thing happens or we break suddenly then access will have more chance's for sleep. Access looks was good. but it's accessory was very low quality. And main disadvantage was it's parts are very low quality, In my access I reaper it's speedometer 2 times till now. And during winter starting the access in the morning it will stop some times. it's suspension was good compare to other moped.company not give the proper service to the clients.this was my own experience. It's engine was to hot when we travel around 10 km. so It's engine oil need to changed earlier.",Suzuki

I purchased a suzuki access 125 a few months ago and now I realise my decision is very good as the scooty is very amazing. The scooty is much more better from the other scooties in this class.,Suzuki
I purchased access 10 days before and it continuously getting breakdown. On the second day when i complete my shift at 10 pm it suddenly break downed i drew the bike 8 kms . The service center people repaired it but same thing continuous..... I took 3 and half-a-day leave to its services. I spoke with the manager he promised me to give replacement after recording all the statements for the service center people within 2 days and finally he changed the total boby of the old own stating that the problem will not arise but again done the same. And now i'm going to file a complaint against them.,Suzuki
I purchased access 125 cc. pickup is ok . mileage is reasonable. Battery life is very less. (hardly one year). front break and rear break gives kiiiich sound which is annoying fro pedestarians as well as the rider.maintenance cost is not reasonable for middle class person.,Suzuki
"I purchased access 125 cc. pickup is ok . mileage only 30km/ltr, front break and rear break gives kiiiich and also while pickup also rear weal making abnormal sound. If we ask service people they are not respond properly and that sound is very irritating & specifically Bangalore APPLE service team don’t know how to behave with customer & they are talking very rash and in Bangalore very less service centers,",Suzuki
"I purchased access 125 recently went to purchase Activa125 but on test driving and looks bought this scooter.I am getting average fuel consumption of about 50 kms to liter of petrol as the scooter is new and engine will take time to set.I like and enjoy the ride quality, you feel taller than crowd riding this scooter.Lights are very good.Storage space is excellent.Shock absorbing is very good.Overall I like this scooter. Now in 2021 after 5 years of ownership, I bet I made I right choice buying Suzuki Access 125cc. Perfect scooter all maintainence services from dealership no issues.",Suzuki
I purchased access in 2012 and experience with this scooter was not satisfying.,Suzuki
I purchased access in sapthagiri Suzuki. Most observably awful moped and customer service.Not even 1 week after I acquired get to it started spilling oil .I additionally need to say one all the more thing in regards to get to that this vehicle doesnt give mileage.It was taking 10 mins general to start potentially I had keep crushing starter or use kicker for 10 min. On my first free organization they took 3 days to profit my vehicle and they had in like manner realized a minor gouge on mud ensure which they were charging for me .The motor stops a great deal which is bad for a vehicle.Till date I need to do reboring and changing of finish bore very nearly 5 times. When I got some data about the blemish on mud screen manager condemned,Suzuki
I purchased brand new SUZUKI ACCESS 125 CC scooter with the worth rupees sixty five thousands only at the very popular and eminent destination of SUZUKI .,Suzuki
"I purchased my scooter two years bage from bangalore. Apple auto(not good a service providers, engineer knowledge zero).bangalore. I paid ther 48k case. As i was sure about suzuki engine it really greate performance and smooth.",Suzuki
"I purchased new Suzuki Access 125 in last month. Main thing I want to tell about Mileage, the mileage of the bike is very acceptable around it will give 45-50 km per liter in a Bangalore city. The look of the scooter is very beautiful anyone can attract that beauty. Then come to comfort of the scoter is very excellent because the scooter’s seat is very large and easily sit three persons.  Hence the scooter is very comfortable when compare to any other scooter available in the market. The power of the scooter is very excellent when compare to any other scooter. The engine is excellent. It is very attractive in looking. I am very glad to say that the new access 125 has now came to market with colour variants. In this new colours are maroon red, and blue very amazing colours. I purchased Red access 125 which is entirely different from old Suzuki access 125. Engine is very powerful. Ladies also can ride and balance easily. Because the pleasuring thing is that its kerb weight is now deadly reduced to 102kg which is normal weight for all genders.  Riding is very extra-ordinary and gives exciting feel. The new look which I most liked in this scooter is steel mirror with round shape. It further enhances the look of our scooty New Suzuki Access 125. The more important advantage of this scooter is its under seat space is widen than the old access 125. Due to this wide space we can easily keep our helmet and rest of the things easily. Another needed benefit introduced in New Suzuki Access 125 is mobile charging pin in the front and keeping half litre water bottle in the left side of  front. Thrilling riding and high pulling capacity and luggage spacing is really amazing which I never seen in any of the scooters. Its multi-purpose scooter we can say. Because its helpful for family riding, like 3-4 people can easily sit due to its large lengthy seat. Another thing is its stylish which can also be bought by the college students who prefers most stylish scooter. Fuel saver is its main feature. One mind blowing thing I wish to say is my scooter is now ran upto 300km, service is not taken yet as the service is given after purchasing by one month or 750km whichever is earlier.  I am very sure that without service only it gave upto 45km mileage so its 100% sure that after regular services no doubt it will give above 50km/litre. Excellent modification because I have discussed with many of my friends who are using old access 125 who were complenting that its not good at mileage wise, so don’t buy. But when I visited to showroom those salesmen were very sure about new access 125 mileage and they preferred us to buy and gave assurance about its mileage. Its sure. I suggest to all scooter buyers to buy new access 125 which will really serve your all purposes.",Suzuki
"I purchased one for my wife she is a teacher for traveling at a maximum of 10 km per day. Its ok for us to use this one, but the service of this two wheeler in Cochin especially Manikandan motors are very poor they don't know the actual complaint and remedy.",Suzuki

"I really don't like the styling and performance of this bike. This segment has lot of other best options to buy, rather going to suzuki access. The pickup provided by this bike doesn't matches with the engine provided with this power.",Suzuki
I really dont like the sound it makes while driving. It sounds like an old bike. It doesn't sound smooth. that is the horrible part.,Suzuki
I really not recommend this Suzuki bikes because if have any problem they have attend and try to slove our problem but thier service is favour to thier dealers. To connect Suzuki customer care we have to wait more than 7mins and thier will take three days of time to know your problem and attend us. Really too bad service and this bikes having manufacturing problems,Suzuki
"I recently bought Suzuki Access 125 and believe me, its a great non gear bike. Not only in terms of its looks but also in terms of performance. I became a fan of this bike, when I first saw it. Lets talk about it features.",Suzuki

"I recently met with a accident in my scooter. The scooter was hit by another bike.  I expected more damage and expenditure to rectify the scooter. But to my surprise, just the air filter cracked and I had to spend 800 rupees to replace that. It has proven that it is well made scooter.",Suzuki
I recetly buy this scooter what a amzing performance great pick up nice head light stylish classic look seat is also too good totally comfortable smooth rides nice gripping on road but mileage is low as they sad but at the and I think its best in this class totally amazed by this scooter it available in many colors all colors are good.i personaly advised take a test drive of it if you planning to buy a new scooter.,Suzuki
I recommand all my friends it is very nice scooty and good milage.,Suzuki
I recommend all of you don't buy Access 125 only one feature good that is pick up and other than that nothing is good in this scooter if we compare to other scooter in the segment,Suzuki
I recommend each and everyone for not to prefer this scooter as it may not live upto your expectation and would be a very difficult and horrible experience for everyone.,Suzuki
"I recommend other options like Honda Activa, TVS Jupiter rather than going for Suzuki Access.",Suzuki
I recommend that nobody should buy this vehicle due to its poor suspension its not suitable for indian Road conditions.,Suzuki
"I recommend you all to go with ACCESS 125, based on its performance and all its a great scooter .",Suzuki
I regularly went to services for my bike in time. Form past 7 months it's annoying me like anything for every 2 weeks it's creating a new problem and troubling me on road.,Suzuki

"I researched alot and took test drive of Activa and Access both. Finally I opted for Access for its look, mileage and comparively better reviews.",Suzuki
"I ride it one time there are so many confusion b4 purchase it . I think Suzuki is not a successful competitor in Indian market coz all previous 2wheeler are badly flop in Indian market. where the question is belong to ACCESS 125 we can't say much more. as all user says it is 4-5000 costly than the other coz on its mileage but if we compare it with other like Honda Activa, Aviator etc are easier in the long run these bikes will sustain their mileage. The parts of Access are costly and not easily available in small cities. services are also costly. The Ratio between mileage cost and Maintenance  cost  will be equal as like others. We can say Mileage is more But Maintenance cost is Also more. in other bikes Mileage is small less and Maintenance is more less.",Suzuki
"I ride it one time there are such a variety of disarray before buy it . I think Suzuki is not a fruitful rival in Indian business sector cause all past two wheeler are gravely slump in Indian market. At first for 9 months being another vehicle benefits works for me regarding smooth ride, great pickup, but  the mileage that it gives just around 40km per Liter. The parts of Access are excessive and not effortlessly accessible in little urban areas. administrations are likewise exorbitant. The proportion between mileage expense and Maintenance expense will be equivalent as like others.",Suzuki
I ride the bike for about 35 km per day. So my priority was set on mileage and comfort. Another requirement was to allow rest of the family members to ride it without much training(Every one drive the previous Kinetic Honda),Suzuki
I rode a lot of scooters but suzuki access 125 is the best among them all.,Suzuki
"I rode all bikes in market before I decided to buy htis one. Had gifted one to my dad 2 years back. He was more than satisfied with this scooter- he has used many scooters in his life- lambretta, Bajaj Vespa, Bajaj Priya, Kinetic Honda. this one is real NO HASSLE bike.",Suzuki
I saw the new suzuki access125 on the suziki stand at the auto expo my heart sank .it looked so em weird and then it did back flips it d gained torque and lost nearly 10per cent of its weight lets get styling out of the way suzuki has reworked practically every panel of the new access 125 the front apron and mudguard are metal and the body is plastic under that bodywork is an SEP-fied 124cc cylinder engine with CTV transmission SPE is abunch of tweak that allows suzuki to offer more performance the new access 125 make 8.7 ps adn 10.2 nm weight 112kg to just 102kg suzuki finally haven't head back on features either theunderstant cavity has significant intrusions but is still 21 liters in volume well we got 48.1kmp on our city cycle and 58.5 on the highway which round out to 50.7kmpl overall. The slotis also joined by a cigarette charging socket and a mamual choke lever on the inside of the apron .,Suzuki
"I sold my 6 year old Bajaj Pulsar to buy this scooter. Not only this one has huge storage space beneath seat, but also has great pickup as compared to any scooter available in market today. Engine is very responsive and pretty silent. Smooth ride is guaranteed with good shock absorbers- especially the front fork ones like a motorcycle.",Suzuki
I specially want to write about suzuki access because I have really suffered using it.,Suzuki
"I started my search with HONDA scooters. The staff in showroom were less care about the test drive and customers queries but more into sale of there product. On-showrom/ ex-showroom/ loan/ interest rate/ RTO fee/ insurance/ all money related query were thoroughly explained but when it come to real deal about the product i.e. scooters they were sailing, there replies started becoming insufficient and blank. They stick on there market popularity agenda and best millage record. Aviator was my choice from all scooters they had. But all honda scooters have this problem of brakes and the jerk u get at road pits.",Suzuki
"I strongly feel that suzuki doesn't know how to make moped.there is no need to give 125cc engine coz it has got auto clutch and the automatic scooters are well known for poor average like(kinetic nova 135, kinetic honda etc).the handling is not so comfortable(compare to activa and pleasure)when u take a turn at slow speed it feels that the bike is unbalanced.....apart from that it has got typical look LIKE A BULKY DUCK....",Suzuki
I strongly recommend this to everyone who is looking for Family scooter.,Suzuki
I strongly recommend to the citizens to India to go for the vechile blindly.,Suzuki
"I taken suzuki access from resale owner just within 5 years. I taken last 7-8 months, till date I put 7000 -8000 but still it stops frequently.",Suzuki
I tell you nothing is better than this comfortable thing swag and standard so even the college students can prefer this vehicle speed and safety at same time,Suzuki
I then called up the Company head office and complained the issue and it was concluded that dealer cannot force to sell accessories. He was ordered to pay me back Rs. 1900/- for accessories. Still he has not responded for the rest of the amount that he has charged extra saying that it is extra expense towards RTO passing and has to offer bribe to RTO officer which is again a big issue. As a customer we dont have to pay a single rupee more than that declared by to company as ON Road Price. Just be aware while buying any such product and send a complain to the company. I trust the brand as it is world famous and I believe that internationally the brand will not take such complains easily.,Suzuki
I think Access is giving good competition to Activa. But the attitude of the company with regard to after sales is acting against its favour.,Suzuki
I think dealer advised me to use kick start for few days because battery was new and it will require some time to get charge. Other than this its super scooter. Suspension is really comfortable. Good pick-up with power. Really good one.,Suzuki
I think in market there are lot of option available to purchase mileage giving giving bike. so if you are looking for mileage giving bike dont buy this one.,Suzuki
I think it better but nt good and price also much.i think its only for rich people and not for suitable for poor peoplw thats my thinking other wise its good bike.who have more money they can afford it and,Suzuki
"I think many of the complaints pointed out in other reviews, like poor service, irresponsible dealerships, poor battery( exide battery used actually) etc. are all isolated problems. Such things could happen to any other bike and we can not generalize them to all Access scooters. I have got bad service experience with my Honda shine and Chevrolet Spark as well. I now learnt that this problem is common with all dealers and we must be prepared to handle them.",Suzuki
I think one this is scooter matches the reliability norms as compared to Honda Activa,Suzuki
I think that is look is awesome for the womens and girls and the teenagers it is really comfortable with teenagers and girls.,Suzuki
"I think the look of the bike is awesome for the women's, girl's and teenagers. It is more comfortable while driving`",Suzuki
I think this is not so nice I donot like this scooty at all cause of balancing my frd have acess and he is using from last 2 year he said the petrol performance is good but the scooty body are of fibre so iski wajah se scooty kharab h by chance agar scooty gir jaye toh puri body khaarab ho jayegi aur kharcha ayega bhot zda I think I will suggest this scooty to girls only baki the pickup power of this product is very great,Suzuki
I think this is the worst scooter of my life. I did not think about to buy this again. after 2 year I have to sale this scooter at a price of 30000 only I hate it very much,Suzuki
I think this review will be able to tell you relaity behind using this product,Suzuki
I this scooter engine is in center balancing is the most important feature .when you ride scooter at 60kmh and suddenly brakes apply not skid on left or right.,Suzuki
I thought to purchase a scooty which will give good millage and finally I choose Suzuki access 125 because it is giving excellent milage with fuel consumption and 3 persons can freely travel through access 125. This is the greatness of this bike and Handling control is very nice and comfortable in traffic also. It looks pretty awesome and scratch less. The comfortness is very important to every traveller where here we can get that definitely.,Suzuki
"I took delivery today ACCESS 125.What a vehicle.Because of MS I choosen this vehicle.I was using Activa prior to this.For using more than 6 years I thought of going again for Activa but after Access 125 entry I realy liked its looks & design, I followed reviews in mouthshut then I decided to go for it.",Suzuki
"I travel almost 45KM per day in city, so unknowingly before 1st service I had gone to 70s speed though I thought to control the bike within 40s speed before 1st service. Further after 1st service I noticed that the bike is giving a very well mileage of 52 km to 57km/lit, if I drive the bike above 60s speed the mileage will 52 km and if I remains insight of 60s speed then the mileage is very much appreciated to 57km.",Suzuki
"I travel on it app 200 kms per week Till date absolutely no issue, though I know my scooter's servicing is pending...One incident I would like to share: I was zooming on it one fine day and On road there was a car, the driver was already disturbed as a truck was taking u-turn and he was behind the truck. So I was passing from left but the driver didnt see me and hit from his left corner on my vehicle. Like I said I was in speed, (50-60 km/hr) so the vehicle got disbalanced.",Suzuki
I tried to complain to Suzuki in their website but to my surprise al the emails bounced back. It seems they are not interested in solving customer grievances & just interested in product selling. Then I got pissed up & showed at local mechanic & he rectified the problem as it was due to some wrong settings. Now i am planning to dispose this & buy Honda Activa which is tried & tested by millions. !!,Suzuki
I trust on this company tooo uch becoz my 1st bike was Suzuki samurai 125 it's helps me alot when I strt riding bike when I was a kid I love to ride that bike no one can chase this company .,Suzuki
"I ues this bike last 11 months. Suzuki Access 125 is a good bike.a awesome bike milage is very good and this bike good for middle class family.its very comfortable and handling is nice.its a famous bike for long driving, batery life good, self start, low weight, easy control and everybody can drive easily.you can drive it down cities and villages easily any type of ways you drive it comfortable.its spare parts available in market. Suzuki Access 125 available in many beautiful colours.its a good bi.ke",Suzuki
"I use only shell petrol. You can feel the difference between shell and and other brands while driving, Off course slightly it will be heavy on your pocket,",Suzuki
I use this but it is not satisfying for me I use yamaha bike which more greatful to this.milage is good so.comfortness is also good but company can do more better than this reliability is good but not satisfying. road grip is also not satisfying so please do a road test and after satisfying purchase this . I am a fan of yamaha bike whish is very good in all the parameter so go and take a test drive of all the company and than deside to buy,Suzuki
I used it for about 4 years and I oberved that it requires a high maintenance. The mileage of the scooter is also not that good. It runs only 25-30km with 1 litre of petrol. the grip of the tyres is average I would suggest you not to buy this if you are buying this scooter for mileage.it is comfortable though has a large seat compared to other scooters but I later on discoverer that jupiter is more comfortable than access 125. The best thing about the scooter is only the looks but nowadays you can get a much better scooter than access 125 so I would suggest not to buy it.,Suzuki
"I used it for my daily travel to office, market as well as other places. Low maintenience required and very good and upto my comfort. Good vechile ever rided by me.",Suzuki
"I used it more than 1year roughly before selling it but it never gave me any sort of problem. its the best among its catagory in terms of milage, pickup and speed. I used it in street races and did stunts with it with ease. its very comfortable and also have the best resell value. and I was in love with its unique engine sound and now I am regretting selling it. I may just buy access 125 again.",Suzuki
I used last 3 years now also the avrage is mainten and its one megor problrm is its front wheel is Baumping more. Its a major problem in each and every Access 125 scopter.,Suzuki
I used so many times my friends bike suzuki access 125. This is very extraordinary bike for all age groups and have very passionate want to buy this bike. It gives max 50kilometers per liter and have good looking of old model suzuki access. It is very comfort to seating for a ride. Me and my friend ride this to tirumala hills. That road are all ghat roads then the bike got very much pickup on ghat also. Suzuki company released so many good appeal colours. The road grip is good at the time of breaks and U turnings.,Suzuki
I used this old model. it was very nice. It is a wonderful bike and it is more driving is suspension is light low but buddies price very nice. its scooters pickup is very good other scooters it is a more powerful than any other comparing scooter. it is wait so light so it was a very highest speed in go and I am drive many time 90 kmph this scooter old model I used since 7 year and it was a very nice condition and its engine is very good condition but the piston is so light low quality. it's mileage is of 55. And their new model is a also beautiful and this better than old model their body is a very strongly and their colour is a very beautiful.Thany you .thank you for watching my review and my opinion,Suzuki
"I used to havw this vechile it was good it was comfartable but the biggest and worst problem is that once it start creating problems it will never be okay you will get it repaired and there will be same problem in short time so you just have to sell it , its never gonna b working fine again two major problem of this its kick will stop working and it will start to throw a lot of smoke",Suzuki
"I want share my experience to you I had purchased Access 125 scooty.this sooter is so looking for good. from the beginning the comfort of using this scooter was bit hart when used for long distance.so I rather recommend this scooter for casual driving .i drive close to 60 kms in a day.in the mileage of this scooty is 35km per litter.after this scooty one year I stater encountering too much trouble in terms of maintenance.the electric start is hardly started working for me in the mornings, i started getting used to kick start.in this bike hard to use during raining season as the placement position is very low for rain water enter and create trouble.for the 8 months, the tires road grip is fantastic and appeal but after using it for an year everything is falling up-part and the appeal starting fading away.after using this scooter is not comfortable to use. so friends I recommended to you buy this bike don't waste your money.thank you.",Suzuki
I want to feel more comfortable when I drive so now I want to purchase a automatic scooter there r many scoters but the real competion is between acess 125 and activa.so plzz guys help me out with this problem.me alread read all the reviws of both this scoter in this mouthshut but still my confusion remains constant.mailenge is not a big deal with me but what I want is maintence free bike like mine tvs victor.waiting for ur comments guys..,Suzuki

I wanted to go for family bike where every one of family can ride the bike and then I choose for Suzuki Access 125. Well I paid for it in two instalments of 10 days and got the bike to me after 2 days of all payments and it was very surprise to me as the sales person had committed to me only of after 30 days to get me the bike due to high demand. I selected to Red as my choice of color for my bike.,Suzuki
"I was Hero Maestro till then and felt ok with it due to some problems I was above to change to new one, shortlisted Honda Activa 125, TVS Jupiter out of two I have finalized Honda Activa 125 Disc which consts me 82 k( Hyderabad onroad price) nearly I was looking for black color and tried in 2 showrooms but stock unavailable and I need to wait for 3 weeks for my selected model I have decided to wait and above to book, but somehow New Access 125( which was not in my choice of selection) attracted me while and I wen to showroom immediately and had a look and really liked it and I have done test drive and with its pick up and driving experience I have deiced to go for it, I have opted for Black color in Access 125 disc onroad price was 72k and which was available in stock and taken delivery on January 12th 17.From the day 1 iam enjoying the drive and recently we have planned for long drive almost 1600 kms up and down, believe me its foolish thought but myself and my friend went off from Hyderabad to Srikakulam recently, its really wonderful highway driving experience we had, we never came down speed of 90 kms stability is rock solid with doubles with our luggage, road stability, turnings, pick up is excellent, in our 1600 kms journey we have never faced any trobles really I liked my choice, yes there were some flaws as mileage we got only 30 to 35 kmpl( as we cannot expect more than that at athat speed) and in sudden braking we have felt rear tyre skidding which was a dangerous but overall its my good choiceI suggest people looking scooter with pick up and good experience can opt for Suzuki Access 125, Thnks",Suzuki
I was confused between Honda Aviator and Suzuki Access....  then selected Access cos of Mileage and power..this baby is 125 CC  where as Aviator is 102 CC... incidently  Aviator uses the same engine used in Activa and Dio....,Suzuki
I was decided to buy dio instead of access.but I bought access. Now I feels that my decision was right.,Suzuki
I was happy with Activa (60000 KMS) yaa some minute problems.Believe me I never crossed mileage more than 40kmpl.Fine no problem.Only disadvantage is suspension & morning I have to use choke for starting.Iam happy today.,Suzuki
"I was in market for a gearless scooter. Two reasons contributed in making a decision to sell off Honda Trigger, which was serving me good; namely Hyderabad city traffic and a need to cater the grocery and vegetable market runs which were utterly uncomfortable with 1 up on my Trigger.",Suzuki
I was little hesitant with WEGO because of lack of trust in TVS engines and not explored / proven in the market.,Suzuki
"I was looking for a allround package and selected Jupiter, New Access and SR150. after taking test ride of SR150, I striked out coz it was too tall for my wife. then we tried Jupiter, it clicked all the check-boxes, but I was looking for something beyond 110CC. a friend of mine recommended to NEW ACCESS 125. I took a test ride with my wife. the moment I raced it from the standstill, I got to know whats underneath. shear performance of 125. I zeroed on Access, then I had to just coerced my wife into getting this slicker zipper. Got everything in place and Blue Mermaid was delivered in the midst of thunders. Took a ride down the internal roads and found my decision was not wrong. Handling was very good compared to any other except the new entrant(SR125, SR 150, NTORQ). Its just breezes through. THe common problem I face with other 110CC's was that the pillion rider had to stretch his thighs on the outside due to fatter rear, but in access 125 this is not. it has got the slimmest rear, hence long pillion rides are not painful. suspensions are feather light. it easily absorbs bumps with two in tow. I found the front tyre was little smaller than the others but then the breezy overall handling negated this. the only thing which troubled me is the frequent visits to petrol pump. gave me an average of 30-35KMPL. My daily commute is 7km with 10-15km on weekends. maybe thats the reason it is not giving more. Digital console is just a gimmick, it looks like a 2 liner pager with fuel meter, tripmeter, oil change. No CLOCK. with a big speedometer.  instruments & controls quality is good. after a long year of ownership it still zips around as a new bie. TOUCHWOOD.",Suzuki
I was looking for a good scooter for my wife and I found that Activa has monopoly because no other scooter was offering the kind of features activa was giving.,Suzuki
I was looking for a scooty and decided to buy suzuki access 125 after some deliberation as my son liked it. The looks are quiet good and the good things stop at that. It has the worst mileage amongst all the gearless scooters. mine does not give more that 30 kmpl when riding smoothly.,Suzuki
I was looking for a second scooter to fulfill the yawning gap between a 9 year old Pep and my Corolla .My choice narrowed down to a Wego or Access . Gave the Activa a bye as its ergonomics are bad - very poor driver posture wherein one can end up with arms paining.,Suzuki
I was not able to feel so called XTP- extra torque performance in suzuki. they got to inject more of XTP.,Suzuki
"I was not willing to write a negative review puRobotouchcly however one incidence made me to do so. Saturday 23th I had given my scooter for service @ 9.38AM, @ S K Sanskriti motors, Wagholi, Pune that is in time.",Suzuki
I was one of the first customers of Suzuki. Bought this bike as the name 'Suzuki' was associated with it. I have been using this for the last 3 years or so..,Suzuki
"I was promised a call back after service is done, I haven’t received any, after to many call at service station and no response I had to walk in.",Suzuki
I was very excited before I bought this scooty. after buying this this scooty does not make me happy as I think.,Suzuki
"I was very impressed intially & now also because of the control I am getting in lower speeds in the bumper-to-bumper traffic.Even at 5km/h, the scooter is steady and well balanced without the need for stretching out your legs to balance.In the intial days I use to love the traffic lights. When the signal turns",Suzuki
"I wasted my half day in servicing station begging them to complete. I complained the same with manager Raghavendra about the above incidence, he also don’t have any answers. I said them on face, I will escalate this to Suzuki team about this incidence, they are considering this as minor no need to highlight it and it will bring bad name to their dealership, in turn I said this need escalation so that these are not repeated to any one",Suzuki
"I went for this new model because of my association of quality with Suzuki(Cars). I visited Honda & Bajaj showrooms. even though I have driven Kinetic Honda for long time, I still respect it for many aspects.",Suzuki
"I went some 10 ft ahead with an unbalanced bike, by then I had applied breaks and I halted. I took a deep breathe and looked behind, the driver was looking at me.well I was in hurry so I had to leave... but the moral of the story is had it been Rodeo, Pleasure or any light bike, I would probably had spent a couple of months lying in hospital. That day I thanked suzuki by my heart and my decision to buy this :)",Suzuki
I went to all the suzuki/Honda showrooms in Hyderabad.for its Onroad Price and TestDrive.Unfortunally no testdrive is provided for Aviator.But the waiting period is too long for Aviator 45 days.Access30 to 45 Days.,Suzuki
I will clear this in detail. This bike is first of all 125 cc bike but not go up to 80 km.its pickup is ok but not as much as I expected. Its average is also bad. Not good at this range.,Suzuki

"I will review on suzuki access 125 which is my all time favourite scooter.suzuki is a top brand automobile manufacturing company which manufactures great vehicles which are good in mileage, speed and performance.Mileage-The mileage of this scooter is good.it is somewhat 50-60 kmpl when it is regularly maintained.200 rs petrol can easily work for 3-4 days when ur office is not more than 10 kms from home.Comfortness-The comfort level of this vehicle is beyond level.the seat of this vehicle is too comfortable and its too large that 2 people can easily sit on it.more over the shock absorbers of this vehicle are so good that it does not make us experience any shock on bumpers or any other conditions.the grip of this vehicle is so good that it can easily be governed with perfection and moreover it is user friendly.Performance-The performance of this vehicle is awesome.It can pickup a speed of 60 kmph in just 5 sec which is too awesome.moreover its engine is well designed which makes the drive smooth and fast.Reliabilty-The parts of this vehicle is durable and doesnt break off easily or unconditionally.when it is kept idle for months than it may show some deformity but if it is used frequently, it is tougher and will not dissapoint.So in overall conclusion I would say this vehicle is awesome in all aspects and it is worth buying.",Suzuki
I will suggest not to buy this moped instead buy the Honda Activa.,Suzuki
I will suggest you not to go onits lools with Suzuki Access 125 . it is a very bad scooter and you will be dissatisfied after buying Suzuki Access 125.,Suzuki

I wish they could design the air filter and spark plug to be located a little higher from the current place. twice I had water getting into the air filter during heavy rain in Bangalore after the silk board flyover. The water level was around 7-8 inches high.,Suzuki
I would ask for purchasers never choose suzuki access 125. Its the most exceedingly awful bike I have ever gone over. The motor got stopped following 10 months of utilizing it even in the wake of keeping up as a part of approved administration focuses of suzuki.

"I would never like to recommend suzuki access 125! It comes with 64 kmpl mileage, 124 cc engine capacity with 91 kmph top speed. It comes with alloy wheels and radial tyres. Comfort level is also very good. And if I talk about handling and control it is just awesome. Looks of this bike is AVERAGE. BUT THE MAIN THING IS THIS BIKE IS NOT DURABLE AND RELIABLE.I have been using this bike since last six months, there are many issues I found like engine defects, services issues etc. According to me if a bike do not have good after sale services then we should avoid to buy. And even ACCESS 125 is actually giving me just 41 kmpl mileage.",Suzuki
"I would not reccommend to middle aged ones because it lacks build quality and power sometimes.Access is all about looks.It has a stylish body, digital speed meter, disc brakes etc.It is really fun to ride in traffic.",Suzuki
I would not recommend this access 125 to anybody for the following;,Suzuki
"I would request buyers never opt for suzuki access 125.

I would say the small business man should but this vehicle to expand their business and also help to reduce cost of materials moving from one area to another area.I would suggest all small retailers and small business man should go with Suzuki Access 125.,Suzuki

"I zeroed down on Access 125( Fibroin Metallic Matte Color) Suzuki has now incorporated tubeless tyres, Aluminium grab handle at back. 3D Access Emblem on both sides. Also the front fender(or) bumper is now steel and it looks sleek compared to older models.",Suzuki
I'll say that is not a vehicle problem that is service providers mistake who dont know the product.,Suzuki

"I'm here to write a review like a normal user but not like a professional user of suzuki access 125. I did check all the top scooters models like activa, fasino, Jupiter etc. The reason why I did choose suzuki access is its design. I really liked its design and style. I got bored of looking at the same head light shape, same design for all the scooters by honda, hero, yamaha etc. some scooters are really horrible with lots of stickers attached to it saying it as a design and style. I shortlisted suzuki and yamaha fascino which looks extremely stylish on girls. but later decided not to buy yamaha because of its availability of spare parts and its cost. Yamaha spare parts are really expensive and customer service is also not so great. so finally decided to take suzuki access.",Suzuki
"I'm not here to discuss about the features like a professional explaining about the torque, power, cooling system etc. But ill give my own experience with this bike in a normal way.",Suzuki

I'm really happy and feel good after buy this suzuki access 125.,Suzuki
I'm really unhappy about the vehicle because when I did a market research about the mileage it said it would give 35-40kmpl but it gives around 20kmpl which is pathetic. I'm really feeling worried to take my vehicle outside. I took my vehicle to the Suzuki service centre but they unable to rectify the issue but they say it will become fine after few more servicing. it's been 2years and nothings been change. they are just eating the maintainence cost which is again very high. trust me they have literally looted me.,Suzuki
"I'm sorry; your'touch' is not as gentle as you think. If you can't drive without touching the brakes, please practice on a bicycle first and then come back to a powered vehicle.",Suzuki
"I'm sure this is not only service center people, the company also share the loot.I will strongly suggest not to go for the brand'suzuki' if you don't want to br cheated.",Suzuki
"I'm using new latest model access 125 last 2 months.I have good and worst experience in this vehicle. Actually, it has the good horsepower.Because its pulling is very highly appreciatable.It's road performance also good.But there also a big problem.It's back brake is very dangerous at the time sudden brake.I was nearly escaped three times very badly.About front wheel brake is disk brake.Its is also average disk brake feel.About the mileage, I can go in one litre petrol almost 50 kilometre.I think its meter has also a problem.Because almost everytime its signal was blinking.We can use this as for normal use.About the road grip, it also average experience.It's feels sometime comfortable and also uncomfortable.Access reliability is good.",Suzuki
I'm writing this review after using the Suzuki Access 125 . suzuki Access is one of the best scooter compare to other scooters and its useful for all age groups. I have old model suzuki access 125 but company now launch new look and design of Suzuki Access 125. Access is powerful and fuel efficient scooter. Average of access is 45-50 kmpl. Access gives me comfort while driving. Handling and control is very nice. Access looks is very nice specially new launch access,Suzuki
I've been using access125 for 2.6yrs and it's really doing well. Of course I've serviced it regularly in the initial year just after I brought this vehicle.,Suzuki

"IN KUMBAKONAM suzuki Don't have a proper service center, works carried out in a shabby 12&12 shed, no proper water wash and air filling facility, bills are not proper and replaced parts are not given to us, replacing spares with out our knowledge, worst place to go .",Suzuki

"Iam very unhappy and not satisfied with this vehicle. I purchased on 25/04/2013. I have problem with sound, bikes' back light, no pick up.",Suzuki
If 5 complaints are reported 2 or 3 are taken action on the first attempt. You still notice the issues reported at the time of service. Unreliable compared to HONDA in terms of service. Spare's prices are pretty decent however availability of spares is a problem.(even in showrooms),Suzuki
If I got chance to meet the owner who designs this scooty I will meet him and say him a very good luck for our and his future. So please like it and comment below,Suzuki
"If anybody plans to buy Please don’t look to Swapana Automobiles in Chennai anna nagar, they works for margin only not for render after sale service. Don’t buy any extra fittings provided from Swapana Automobiles. Only two dealers in Chennai city, which is again having monopoly. Moreover Suzuki is not at all interested in accepting any complaints. They seem to be passive in business. They will not give any feedback or suggestions for complaint rose. There may not be any Marketing dept or head.",Suzuki

If anyone have to bought scooter I will suggest to purchase suzuki  access 125,Suzuki
"If described I have checked on first service not my gear oil neither my engine oil was been changed, and in the name of accessories I was been looted with 2 advises sold to me(When I went to collect Access it was already been billed, so I cannot say anything) which I do not need at all on both the services.",Suzuki
"If it does not sway from side to side smoothly, then the metal bar under the headlight is touching the pivot.",Suzuki
If it doesn't pain you enough the service center people will do the needful to make sure that you should curse the moment you decided to buy this brand. They will paste a label of fool on your forehead.I was told the mileage of 56kmpl. However it never gave more than 43kmpl with the best quality petrol.,Suzuki
"If someone is looking for the peppyness while driving and zipping through Mumbai traffic with getting a lot of attention then Suzuki scooter is for them, not for people who very much is concerned about average.",Suzuki

If u are thinking for a new awsome scooter then this is for u,Suzuki
If u compare it with activa which gives it a clear competition I will give a very brief comparison of both as if own both of these now and have used them for more than 3 years  now.,Suzuki

If we built the accessories of the bike then it look is not good and also if we talk about the average the access it gives average around 40-50 and decreases day by day.,Suzuki
"If we talk about the piwerful engine for a non geared while than yes it was the machine which broke the thinking of powerful engine. They introduced 125 cc engine which was unique in its own. The first look of access is great and gave competition to honda activa which is sucessful innovation from honda. So after using it, in crux I want to state both its pros and cons.",Suzuki
"If you are a biginer, so this is scooter is the best.have great grip stability and look give good milage and stability.it has so powerfull engine to climb high roads this scooter comes in differnt colours it starts very fast.Its milage is about 50to 60.I recomend evryone to buy it even I also gonna buy it.",Suzuki

I decided to change my vehicle. The decision came from some reasons - 1. It has already traveled for 30000 kms. 2. I have met with a number of accidents, and once the frame got bent and had to be repaired. 3. The engine was making some noise, and the Honda service people were not able to fix the problem. 4. The starting problem became acute in the recent times. In the morning it will not start with kick at all. 5.

"In 2016 I Bought Suzuki Access 125.Before Buying Suzuki Access 125 I bought Honda Activa 3G in 2015.but Activa is Not better for those people who loves long drive.Access has More space in Seat than Activa. and Also Access is Taller than Activa.In Access you have Disc Brakes , Chrome Rear view mirror, Chrome Body, long seat, taller body, mecwheel, Big Mialage, better speed, and Better design, and 125CC angine with SEP technology. but Activa Dosent has Mecwheel, disc brakes, chrome mirrors. I have both vehicles and I rided Most of The Scooters but Suzuki's Access 125's pickeup is best.",Suzuki

"In Aviator, to open the dicky, you have to use the key in a different keyhole, no centralised control, whereas Acess gives you the comfort of one insertion of the key to everything on the scooter.",Suzuki
"In a first look it looks like ordinary scooter like Activa, Dio, Lets etc. but the handling experience is quite good compare to others. It's quite smooth and light in handling which is an advantage for women / girls. It has 125cc petrol engine and has an automatic transmission like other scooters. It weighs just 110kgs so it's good for handling.",Suzuki
In access you get enough space to keep luggage on foot board.,Suzuki
"In all the service time I told them to tune the mileage, but till now I am not at all get the mileage above 36 km/l. When argued with the manager of service center they told me to leave the vehicle for 2 days for checkup. Finally they recorded as mileage as 46 km/l in the job book. When drive on the road it is only 37 km/l only.  After few months it comes to 28 to 30 km/l.",Suzuki
"In any case, then this is nothing unexpected as the motor is a 125 cc when contrasted with 102 of Activa at first sight, which may however be remunerated by higher weight of Access 109 Kgs when contrasted with 104 Kgs of Activa. Riding position was a great deal more ergonomical and agreeable then Activa however simply from my physical trademark perspective and thus may vary from individual to person. Braking was right on the money and didn't have any elastic feeling like Activa. Front forks are really smooth and may better Activa in average Indian condition which has potholes and pits. I figured out how to drive it deliberately at low speeds through potholes and it was really noteworthy as it didn't scrape the bottom similar to the case with Activa.",Suzuki
In every home some mopeds are available for household use and with same intention we purchased this Suzuki Access 125 and it wil complete 1 year in the next month on Christmas. Its mileage is not improved yet and nowadays its average is 45 KMPL which is too low than any other mopeds in market. Backseaters do not feel comfortable while seating and mostly they get pushed forward while crossing bumpers.,Suzuki
"In fact I was the first one to start the scooter on that day(Saturday – 17th 2007) early morning and it did start with one single press of a button….unlike the Honda activa which had to be given initial choke for few seconds. So for hassle free start it beats Honda Activa compared showroom to showroom while real life starting may differ but I still feel Suzuki access scores here. Next obviously was the exhaust note and acceleration. I had my apprehensiveness as to will opening the throttle stall the scooter like Honda Activa(happens in cold start) but here again it scored. After warm up I went for a test drive and the exhaust note is pretty interesting(more depth) then activa in fact its like Honda Eterno! As I opened the throttle to start moving, the delay from standstill to intial movement post opening the throttle is typical of any variometric scooter and after that it zooms past. The pickup appears slightly better then Honda Activa though I didn’t clock it.",Suzuki
"In february I have purchased this two wheeler.this two wheeler has so many problems like vibration during high speed, poor plastic body and even high engine speed. overall I am dissatisfied with this two wheeler. Even mileage wise I am very disappointed as it gives mileage round 28-30 kmpl. now I have completed two services of this scooter and still has same problems. comfort level wise this bike is very poor you cannot travel for long distance due to hard saddle. even the maintenance cost is also high and company do not have well trained mechanics. this two wheeler is not so reliable and do not travel much on this scooter during rainy season as road grip is very poor. I have also appealed to company for solving above problems but company has ignored my problem . overall very poor quality and I do not recommend this too anyone.",Suzuki
"In free servicing they only wash your vehicle. If you miss the servicing , They say that the warranty is not vaid. Will Suzuki people look into this matter?",Suzuki
"In general, there's little to whine about the all-new Access 125. Without a doubt, there's not a lot to go ga-ga about the outline, however it's an attractive bike, with downplayed, yet shrewd looks and that itself will discover advance among a considerable measure of shoppers searching for a solid and stable family scooter.The drawback if there was one, would be the seat, regardless of the possibility that it's very rich and agreeable. At 780mm, the seat tallness isn't exactly open for riders of all statures, and what mixes matters is the width of the rider situate. In this way, at somewhat more than 5'9"", I couldn't put my feet level on the ground at stop lights, so this could be a test for a few riders. In any case, the new Access 125 likewise gets thinner - a great 10kg at that - over the more seasoned model; so it has better energy to-weight proportion and simple mobility. At an asserted 64kmpl mileage, anticipate that fuel utilization will be up in the 40s or even 50kmpl in this present reality.",Suzuki
In indian market there is only limited number of scooters have more power which means more than 120cc. So I baught suzuki access125 before 6 months .Now im not satisfied with this scooter .it have more power and worst controling and handling .the milage is ok its satisfying.the scooter big in size so its not easy for girls,Suzuki
In last. so if you are looking a scooty options then according my  personal experience you should go with Suzuki Access 125 because its a very affordable cost and have a good strength .,Suzuki

"In my experience its not a good scooter for youngsters who are looking for aggressive scooters. its a powerful 125cc scooter but handling is so bad. automatic transmission feels lagging every time. fuel consumption is very bad, I got just 36 km per liter.the com pony said that it is maintenance free battery equipped scooter, but with 6 months usage the battery lost its capacity of storage. so its a bad scooter from my daily experience, only the co lours are worthy. better try another options in our market.",Suzuki

I got an mileage of 60 km/ lt which was very decent. I would recomend every body to buy this scooter.",Suzuki
In my home I have active and access 125. In my Activa is better than Access and much safer than access 125. Pls dont waste money just for 5km extra millege.,Suzuki
In my opinion its good to buy Suzuki Access only if you know a suzuki dealer or have more money to maintain it.,Suzuki
In my option you can get better option that this scooter suzuki Access 125 I didn't get even a single think or a feature good in this Scooter.,Suzuki
In my personal opinion this scooter is best for any physique especially fatty peoples due more powerful engine.,Suzuki
In my view racers or bikers should buy it cause it has a nice engine and more cc in any other comparative it has 125cc engine its fuel consumption is nearly about 64km/per litre. Its handling and control are very nice one of the best thing I liked is all about their service very great service provider. But the main thing as its body is not made of metal so when an accident happens you need to change full body parts. But I think they are even working on it and the new models are really very cool comparatively!,Suzuki
In new model the new thing is that this model is fully metal body the last vesion is plastic body . in this model the digital speedometer is given and the it increase the height of front tire this model is available in 7 varient colors . the new access gives a more mileage and it gives 55 kmph.the comfort of this new model is very good . the length is short in this model so go and buy its perfect . because its best,Suzuki
In next if you want to ride a very imagination & Amazing  then you have a Suzuki Access 125 to make a your ride very enjoyment.,Suzuki
In our family we have already used the access model of 11/12 but now as the time.passed we decided to buy a new Scotty but its new version was not satisfied me with its features and as well as look.,Suzuki
"In present era traffic become vast problem of india ans roads consist with so many pits. People are so much in hurry, have to reach and catch as soon as possible so there is one solution of all major problem that is Suzuki Access 125.",Suzuki
"In profile, the new Access 125 looks like any other run of the mill scooter but the exhaust muffler looks out of place.The new Suzuki Access 125 gets a semi-digital unit with a digital display for fuel gauge, odometer, service indicator and two trip meters. The seat can be unlocked conveniently through the ignition keyhole which is a good addition. Also the shutter key has a one push central lock system. The scooter that we tested was the top-end variant Access 125 with disc brake and alloy wheels that hasn’t been launched in the Indian market yet. The base version of the new Suzuki Access 125 with steel wheels and drum brake has been priced at Rs 53, 887 ex-showroom Delhi which makes it almost Rs 2, 000 cheaper than the base Activa 125. As a product the new scooter ticks all the right boxes and is a marked improvement over its predecessor along with good mileage.",Suzuki
In scooter segment Suzuki access is the best choice no dout before I am.using maestro I am not satisfied on that time now I am using Suzuki ACCESS now I am enjoying very well it have better comfort .millege.better look in all.the way I am fine other speciality is 125.cc really I recommend all if you looking scooter no other choice,Suzuki
In service wise I did not get any issues with the bike. The performance of this bike is great even though it does not come with abs. I like this bike a lot and I definitely recommended this bike thank you for watching my review. Please like and follow.,Suzuki
In short its a nice vehicle and I will recommend others to buy it because I'm satisfied with what I have bought.,Suzuki
In some of the reviews people said they r getting around 50 to 55 per liter.Off course It depends upon your driving habits and handling. I hope this review will help some of the owners of Access 125 vehicle. There is no harm trying. Please let me know if this review is helpful.,Suzuki
"In terms of features, the Access 125 comes equipped with some notable additions. It includes a fully digital instrument cluster that provides all the necessary information at a glance. The scooter also features a convenient front storage pocket, a USB charging port, and a spacious under-seat storage compartment, which can easily accommodate a helmet and other essentials.",Suzuki
"In terms of looks the Scooty is fine but the body is made up of low grades metal, that gets a lot of scratches. so it doesn't make any sense engine is not fuel efficient I would say because mileage is just around 30 to 35 kmpl .",Suzuki
"In terms of numbers, the 125 CC engine on all new Access 125 produces 8.7 PS of power and 10.2 Nm of torque, which is good enough for city runs. Although I havent rode the old Access, I have been told that the new Access lost some of its power for better fuel efficiency numbers and this despite losing some weight compared to the older model. I wish Suzuki had not done this, this could have been a hoot to drive. Recently read the BikeWale.com comparison between Access 125 and the SR 150 and surprisingly Access 125 was not far behind SR150 when it comes to power and in some departments Access 125 trumped the SR, now thats a great news for somebody like me who ditched SR150 to buy Access 125.",Suzuki
In terms of reliability its not upto the mark its starting prob is always a issue and the engine knocking sound,Suzuki
"In that 4, 3 are fixed. 1, 2 and 5 are not fixed. More over they have given head ligjht misplaced again.",Suzuki
"In the 125cc scooter segment always in a competition, but Suzuki Access wins here.Becuase of the light and powerful 125cc engine and the power it takes out, defeats the competitors.It is affordable in the segment.It have a excellent looks and the new meter console is superb.It have the SEP system makes more mileage.",Suzuki
"In the event that you jump at the chance to take it anyplace in tamilnadu, dont even consider purchasing this in dream. Most exceedingly awful showrooms, most noticeably awful administration. Its like a street side mechanic shop with unreliable proprietors",Suzuki
In the final words in my view is The Power Pack Engine Performance.,Suzuki
In the range of moped this is very comfertable bike which can be prefred by all generation people its handling is very much accurate and it is very light weight for ladies they prefer it over activa because of its light weight and with power of 125 CC .,Suzuki
In this Suzuki access 125 we have upgraded version in which both the world's of power and mileage are suitable the engine was very in the upgraded version the available price range is 77k to 86 I in India it is very comfortable on raods the service for this bike is very good and they receive customers in a humble manner it is one,Suzuki
In this period I had 3 tyre bursts (rear one).One of them was caused by a very small piece of metal,Suzuki
In this product have a problem because suzuki engine was very bad why? because in this engine easily heating very well and also broke the oil seels very well so many members told me this bike is good but they have very small problem in the product we are use this product,Suzuki

"In this review, I am going to try to address some of the common complaints about this scooter.",Suzuki
In total I would definately recommend you to go for it rather than getting confused over other options.,Suzuki
Infact the shape of body is not attractive. Its not a worth at this price .,Suzuki
"Initially engine was good, the vehicle was smooth gave mileage upto 45-50 and no engine sound. After 1st service itself there was engine sound and some sound of loosen parts while driving.",Suzuki
"Initially for 6 months being a new vehicle does works good for me in terms of smooth ride, good pickup.However the mileage that it gives only around 40Km/Litre. The issue starts after then the front wheel will start jumping and with pillion rider it is too worst. The authorized Suzuki service centre people agrees that it is common in these type of vehicle as this is telescopic suspension. Secondly the clutch got easily damaged in a year. It seems it is too sensitive.",Suzuki
Initially the vehicle dragged a little but is quite smooth after 1st service.,Suzuki
Initially they told me that it would take at least 1 month to get the vehicle without any color preference and around 2-3 months for the red one. As I was paying in ready cash they gave me an option for a blue (Euclase silver) vehicle which was booked by someone else but the poor guy was rejected by the financiers. So finally I took my access home on 9th sept 2009 for 52k.,Suzuki
"Initially when I took my Red bike for ride, wow..! It was awesome to experience the Suzuki Access 125 first time. The bike just talks to wind on road when little acceleration is opened.

One of my companions has entry thus before getting it I Took a drive on it. I loved it and chose to get it. Get to has special look and outline with much leg space in front with little box given in front to keep things.  The vehicle takes a decent pickup and is not particularly substantial to deal with. The ground freedom level is great that on rough streets and guards it doesn't touch the ground. The suspensions are adequate to deal with such streets.",Suzuki
Is it worth spending extra Rs 5000 for Access since most of things are almost same? Weight would be sole decision factor.,Suzuki

"It is equipped with maintenance free battery, tubeless tyre and central locking system. The parts are easily available and provide great performance in good price. I am happy wit my scooty and it is better than huge bikes. It gives the comfort to ride and I can take it anywhere I like. I would recommend this scooty since it offers a great value for money.",Suzuki
"It is far better than Activa[25cc more powerful] and better road grip, I felt.",Suzuki
It is great and very very comfortable vehicle . I am very happy with his experience .it give me a comfortable and great and remember able journey . I am very very comfortable with this vehicle. It part are great and very long time use able I am very happy with it . It grip on road is great and very very very good I think it speed is very very good .

It is having great millagge & great pick up .But it is not so comfortable .,Suzuki
It is having pretty large fuel tank with storage capacity about 4.5 - 5 liters. It has a digital fuel indicator which will alarm you when the fuel left goes below 0.75 liters.,Suzuki
It is highly frustrating to spend so much of hard-earned money on such servicing a scooter.,Suzuki
It is is one of the best bikes available in the market in this price range. It has got very good pickup as it comes with 125cc. Bike is very comfortable while riding and seating is also very good. Makers gave a very large seat even 3 people can sit comfortably.,Suzuki
"It is just fantastic, I would rather say that iam afraid to go slow cause of the build and weight of the scooter.",Suzuki
It is less comfortable and not at all easy to handle.Moreover it covers less mileage.And the model is also too old fashioned.It is not at all attractive.It is too expensive and not everybody l can afford it.So according to my personal experience I will not recommend you all to go for this product.The company should work upon the product to make it worthy and easily accessible.,Suzuki
"It is light in weight & design is very well . It cost around 58000 INR with registration charges . It is petrol bike with single cylinder . It has max. power of 8.58 bhp @ 7000rpm . It has good milage . It has small tyres which are of good quality & they have nice grip on road . Comfort wise this scooter is ok . 2 medium size person can easily sit on this . Reliability of this scooter is good . I have to visit garage less time . This scooter is appealing to youngster , ladies , old people .",Suzuki
"It is more comfortable for the Indian riders with specific riding style and it is gear-less, so anyone can ride in our city/street use.",Suzuki
"It is more expensive than the competition.  A fully loaded (all accessories) scooter will set you back by about Rs.47, 750/- in Mumbai.   AND  there is a waiting list.  All the scooters (60 in all for the 1st lot) were sold out in an incredibly short period of time and now you have to wait from anywhere between 1 month and upwards to get your baby !",Suzuki
It is more smoother than both the bikes............SERIOSLY smooth.The Headlight is strong and taillight is attractive & it shines if it is fitted with accessories. The cost is about 49870 with all accessories. The tank capacity is 6.3 litres and the dickey has quite space with maximum of 10 kg weight. The Brakes are very good and can be loosened & tightened by hand.,Suzuki
It is more than a scooty as it has 125cc 4 stroke engine. last year I bought this scooty and I am really comfortable with it rather than other scooties. as all know it is with easy start system just push and go. best thing is that it has big fuel tank with 5.6l iof capacity. fuel consumpion is also less with a very good average. latest model of access has front disc brake. after buying suzuki gives you free service offers. handling and control of this scooty is easy and comfortble. everyone should buy access.,Suzuki
It is nice vehicle in other point of views but not relieble. Sometimes it automatically stops its engine while you are waiting at a signal or just idle. You have to constantly raise the accelator in order to keep it on.(Maybe they have done this for a reason so as to help the comsuption of petrol or maybe someother things but it irritates after sometime),Suzuki
It is normal in comfort and not so poor in speed it's mileage is sixty-five or seventy not good and internal fuel system and not having charging port,Suzuki
It is not a good motorcycle to ride. It has no mileage and maintenance is very poor. The parts are not available in showroom. My friend has these motor cycle. It complaint every 2 week. The seating arrangement is not good. If we put the luggage on this.then it will not pullup,Suzuki
It is not a nice scooty which I would preffer you if you do not want a rough use of it the scooty has a comparitively low average and it also a lower type of scooty.,Suzuki
It is not good it is excellent and after using it for almost 12 years and drive it for almost 50000 kms it is giving me excellent mileage of around 45 kms.,Suzuki
"It is not that good scooter as now many other scooters have arrived in our society, in our modern world with many new features but it is a good one for one practical family. It has a good mileage of 52.45kmpl and fuel capacity is of 5L of petrol, tire type is tubeless and it has many other features too. If you see the space of seat it is very good, means 4 members of family can easily seat and for safety purpose whenever u turn on the scooter then only automatically headlight of scooter also turns on which is a very good feature too. The smoothness of scooter is also very good. And if you buy it in festival season then you will get different and very good discounts too due to which the cost of scooter also deducts. So, according to your needs only you should go for it. And before buying the scooter, go for a ride surely, check the space and if you like the model then only go with your decision accordingly.",Suzuki
"It is not that reliable too, as there are number of issues with this scooter. The gear of the scooter broke very quickly.",Suzuki
It is one of the best powarful bike from the suzuki company with 125 cc engine displacement and it gives arround 40 to 50 kmpl and very comfortable and very comfortable seats and with a excellant reliability and the handling is very easy and with superb control the top speed will be 100kmph and looks are very different with its new designs with different colours with front disc break and rear break is drum type and the cost of the bike is just 60.000 thousend rupees,Suzuki
It is one of the most heavy and most reliable non gear vehicle in market.,Suzuki
It is one of the worst moped that I haven' t seen in my life the only thing good about this vehicle is it has good pick up thats it when comes to mileage in city it gives around 30 to 35kms per litre and the comfort zone is also low compare to other vehicle mainly the maintainance cost is very high and service centre is also not good they do not service properly .road grip is also not good if its raining there will be chances to sqid overall instead off buying this better take the other vehicles and manily after running every 20000kms it wil come to half engine work I personally suffered from this so please dont buy this friends,Suzuki
It is really comfortable for shorter rides.and for womens it is the best.built quality of bike is good.there is no vibrations. This scooter does not require any special maintanance.it is reliable.Handling is good.but in case of breaking its quite hard to stop suddenly.in wet places scooter get skit. It looses control in wet places.this scooter have really nice and stylish look.h headlamp are new and well designed.,Suzuki
"It is really very powerful access byke as it has 125cc engine, I am also very crazy for this awesome byke, it is really very very awesome& comfortable for ridding, not matter if you are riding inside city or you are riding intercity, it is really awesome byke, I loves it, it is easy to ride, easy to park& also it gives us a very economincal average which impact on our home budget, it is having more then space comparing to other which allow us a tantion free life to carry hand bages etc.",Suzuki

If anybody wish to buy scooter then they must go for this one only. In future i will have to buy another scooter / bike then definately i will go for this only. There is no doubt about it.*",Suzuki
It is suitable for aged persons to drive over all when I drive another vehicle I have sawn a good and comfortable drive in city than others . Fuel consumption is normal it does not consume too much of  petrole. In this vehicle handling of control is good according to me students aged persons ans all of them those who wants good service should buy this vehicle,Suzuki
It is superb vehicle to drive. You can feel the 125Cc when you ride it.,Suzuki
It is the bes125cc scooter it has a great milage and also there is a fun tv add also it is very constable and also the boot space is good and also the overall scooter performance is also excellent it has a good leg room The Scotty is worth buying and the scooty is also good for non good road because of the beat suspension this scooty is awesom,Suzuki
It is the best ever moped bike till now in the market. It has the highest mileage and the engine is more efficient which could carry more load at high speed.,Suzuki
"It is the best family scooter for every individual because it can give you a better fuel economy and better looking, stylish and a sporty scooter.just go for it and enjoy your days.thanks friends.",Suzuki
It is the best ride after activa. Bought this product 3 years back and still it is in good condition. It has the best pickup compared to other 2 wheelers. It is light weighted as compared to lower version models of activa so it makes easier to ride for women.,Suzuki
"It is very comfortable for the riders, its space for extra things is also large.",Suzuki
It is very comfortable scooty. it has very comfortable and long seat. it is really really so comfortable scooty.,Suzuki
It is very difficult to ride it at a high speed perfectly clear. If you want good service life of Suzuki Access there must ride the bike speed slower than 60 kilometre per hour and also the engine specification and scooter is greater than a vespa.,Suzuki
It is very good item. It has various colors. It has great milleage. It give comfort to every people. It has less reliability. It has not as much good look but now a days. It has become popular. One can see more number of suzuki access 125 around him. So if one like it than he or she can buy but be carefull.,Suzuki
"It is very good scooter and it is in my range.i searched lot on internet before buying a scooter for  and then I finally decided this for me.Suzuki's Access 125 is a decent effort with a powerful engine, comfortable seats and a stable ride.",Suzuki
It is very reliable and we can uncount it.its quality is good.,Suzuki

It is very smooth and also the structure is good. All the colours are very bright and beautiful. Petrol charges is also not that high.,Suzuki
It is very stylish and handy. Also it under everyone's budget. Highly recommended.,Suzuki
It is worth to purchase it cost around 60 thousand. We can use it for daily use. The maintenance of the bike is less it will not trouble us.,Suzuki
"It isbetter than its closest rival activa because it has better pickup, handling, feels lightweight, brakes are also better only looks are on downside otherwise on every aspect it is better. The newer modle is even better with optional disc brakes and many other features but price is a little high.",Suzuki
It lacks attention grabbing skills but suzuki jas taken care on the new access 125,Suzuki
It looks very good. It simple and elegant design is clutter free and please most of its buyer. A big headlight with chrome surrounding looks old school like cool design is a instant hit or miss. The rear panels are simple and rounded and complete its overall profile.,Suzuki
"It looks very stylish, I personally love the design as compared to other scooters like activa 125",Suzuki
"It makes too much noise as compared to Activa, this segment needs much improvement.",Suzuki
"It merely gives 30-32 kilometers per litre mileage which is very unfair and other scooters can give 40+ mileage! But due to high power and big engine, it gives worst mileage!",Suzuki
"It required choke/ kick start in moderate winters of Jaipur during first start in the morning, one can imagine what efforts it would require in more cooler places.",Suzuki
"It runs like butter on bad roads.. Shock abs are reliable!! Storage space is the largest I have ever seen in any scooter / scooterette.. I can comfortably rest my huge helmet in that... Their single key theft proof locking system is the cool.. u can use it for on/off, handle lock and for under seat opening as well. You can also use the key to close the keyhole shutter which will prevent any one else trying the duplicate key in ur Access. Mileage is more that 50 (before 1st service), comparatively silent engine on road... I wanted to buy a scooter which can be used by me and my husband as well..",Suzuki
"It s look is not good, Not power full, Originaly it s capacity is only 110cc compeney taking 125cc, millage is very lose, its not good vehicle, comfort is very bad compare in any vehicle, handle is not good, Road grip is very low, This vehicle is very dainger, This vehicle is very low speed, it s vehicle not buettyfull",Suzuki
"It save enough time and money for me to do some other activities also. Good milege, well pickup, nice handling, bit good road grip, everything is good.if you are searching to buy a scooty then I suggest you to buy this one.choose your colour and enjoy",Suzuki
It seems that Suzuki India factory does not have proper quality checking of the outsourced parts. On regular roads(not on highways) the average mileage achieved is 33(+/- 2.0) kmpl of petrol.,Suzuki
"It seems the Technician are not at all Trained technically & are just interested to mint money from the customers in form of additional weather coating , selling accessories , selling engine oil ( even though its not due ) .",Suzuki
"It started having issues. Te gearbox, the carburetor, the engine, everything started to have problem.",Suzuki
"It startes giving many problems after few days problems like vibration, getting more sound in engine and also very poor mileage it gives around 30 KMPL. You can buy Jupiter instead of access 125. Jupiter is very fuel efficient scooter. And no such problems. Are mentioned. The new bs4 versions are too good. Smooth and has alloy wheels and disk breaks.",Suzuki
It takes a lot of time everyday to start either I had kept pressing starter or use kicker!,Suzuki
"It takes off other bikes even Discover, Passion easily by its awesome speed. It has great pickup.",Suzuki
It takes only 12 seconds for that. Its headlight is very powerful. And bright. Its braking is alsoexcellent. It has no problem with cold starting. It is an ideal scooter forcity and highway ride. I got a maximum speed of 78 km/hr.,Suzuki
"It very nice mopaied for .men and woman also . best average versions of Suzuki access 125 .this diwali it will bang in all over india . must to known about its look no other bikes as good as thiss access models . mopaid of year it will all types of awards . it tyres are available in drum and disc .over all length 1, 870mm . fuel tank .5.6 . most interesting part its ultra light and robust 125cc engines . best in class milege 64.km/l . its special edition are steel body and stell fender. and alloy whell .",Suzuki
It was a 125 cc scooter so I thought that it would be a more powerful scooter but I was wrong.,Suzuki
It was a bad decision to purchase Suzuki Access 125 . I purchased this one because it had 125 cc . It drinks petrol like its water . It only gives 22 KmpL . The engines shuts down automatically while driving . I have changed its air filter more than thrice but its the same problem again .,Suzuki
It was a good experience not at all byt missing at night lights cos not working propwerly but we can see engins not the bosy or sides well not goood veiws as well so be kindly for your purchases not for humidity in engine better power force and solid frame inner side can you made this at home to prove your byc compare to a loose car,Suzuki
It was a long time when suzuki updated its Access line-up but this changed when suzuki launched Access back in 2016 and so far suzuki has been coming up well with its Access line-up.,Suzuki
It was comfortable to drive if we give an accelerator it would run like anything,Suzuki
It was introduce in 2007. The bike is comfortable to sit and driver It gives good miieage its gives 64 kmpl  average mileage among scooter is 49.3 kmpl,Suzuki
It was introduced at a time when auto gear 2 wheeler scooter market share in motorcycles was increasingly rapidly. And honda activa had a lions share during that tym of around more than 90%.,Suzuki
It was purchased in 2015..when I invested more for a long lasting vehicle. But I am totally disappointed. Friends without more waste of time I come to important flaws of this vehicle as per my experience and repair agencies advice about the vehicle..,Suzuki
It was the bike which good with a good speed and having good looking and also Good picup so it was nice and also its milize also as good as compare to others also so mostly girls and boys of youth will prefer this one and also price also will be good for the what we keeping it was nice one to bye,Suzuki
It was the superb ride without any problem. 4 months before I crossed 90+ kmph near to attibele it was really amazing the bike was in total control.,Suzuki
It wil take much more time to go to 60kmph as compared to all other mopet bikes,Suzuki
It will come in 125cc which we can say displacement.Also it wil be come 4 stroke engine.its fuel capacity is 6 lit.its pick up is more power than activa nad another.,Suzuki
"It will immegiate repair, servicing charges are more, I had a worst experience with this bike and I am riding this bike since two and half years and I spend around 25 thousand for repais only all the items are most expencive compare to other bike, please guys dont buy these bike and dont face problems.",Suzuki
It would start only after injecting oil into the engine manually(which has to be done by a mechanic).,Suzuki
"It's a 125cc engine scooter with a lot of power. You can actually ride with 3 people up the bridge and you'd never feel like running out of power. The pick up is not so great but the best part is acceleration is constant. What I mean by that is whether you give full acceleration or go slowly, the rate by which the speed increases is same.",Suzuki
It's a good scooty if I talk about it's mileage or if I talk about it's look.,Suzuki
It's a good vehicle. 125 cc engine supplies great speed. Suspension is also amazing. It's also good choice for cities. It takes less petrol. Price is also resonable. Dikki is also very spacious. Three people can sit on it comfortably. Maintainace is fabulous. Battery life is also more. Disck break is also nice. More than 50% choice to take access 125. There were no noise pollution. Its sound also better than meastro.,Suzuki
It's a nice bike it has nice whiles I like it butt it want a lettel more you want to better it's fule problem and you want to more biger it's fule tank and head light's has low light's so try to better it and it's comfort is not to good it's back sit is too hard and it's engine has too much hard sound and you want to change it's silencer style thank u,Suzuki
"It's a nice scooter.but there are some disadvantages like, it absorbs fuel more than any vehicles.but its average for all people",Suzuki
It's a very amazing bike with unique features like it has the best breaking system it's engine system is very good it's outer look I loved the most it's pickup is awesome with very good mileage it's comfort level is absolutely awesome it's mirror I loved the most it's lighting system is also good but little behind in average,Suzuki
"It's a very elegant and appealing moped, and I recently purchased a Suzuki Access Connect edition in bronze metallic colour. I'm quite pleased with it. It has a lot of seat room and is really comfortable. Its reception is excellent. It has amazing connectivity and always reminds me to call when I'm driving, which is incredibly convenient for me.",Suzuki
It's average is 45Km/lit which is little bit poor but if you take care of this you can absolutely get 55 Km/lit average.,Suzuki
It's been 2 years with this scooter. I am facing hell lot of issue and no body is there to assist you at service centers.,Suzuki
"It's best in looks comforts and Ride, little average problem but it's natural bcoz all scooters given 40 to 45 km per liter . one thing is that SEP ENGINE is new technology in suzuki . Vibration and Noise sound are quit compare then old suzuki models . In this Scooter Engine is in CENTER Balancing is most important feature . when you ride scooter on 60kmh and suddenly brakes apply scooter not Skid on left n right",Suzuki
"It's front view is not good it is more expensive then the other. It cannot give extra features like other scooter , activa, jupiter etc.",Suzuki
It's is very easy not so heavy. The seat is also very comfortable. The average speed is also good. It is the Best two wheeler.,Suzuki
"It's light in weight as compared to other scooters , hence girls and old age people can ride easily. It's height is more than activa 3g and other common scooters, along with smooth accelaration which gives fabulous experience of riding. I had enjoyed very much driving at village and city roads without pain in my hands after lot of turns, since 1 year. External fuel tank is only thing missing in it, otherwise it's best scooter this range.",Suzuki
"It's like the Best!!!!! You won't Regret, that I vouch for!!!!I love my White Suzuki Access!!!!",Suzuki
It's loks no dought everyone love it child whose age is 15 or the man whose age is 65 any body. All those riders who love to ride mopad they have to love this access 125.,Suzuki
It's look too good. I have already suzuki access.Access is a complete package and should help Suzuki make up lost ground despite the competition .fuel tank is I think around 5.6 litter.acordind to me it is good thing about the produt.in human nature it is in comfort zone.so we can purachase this produt.it han another colour also.i obsrev it is top spped is 91kmph.suzuki's access is impreesed us. I think is is good produt to all pepol bcz it has average rang to purchase.,Suzuki
"It's milage is so good it's give a 37liter/km milage in trafic area, this is a good milage for moped.it's also give a long space, and also give a long site, you can easily ride 3 person, and access also give a space in laguage box.",Suzuki
It's mileage is around 35-40 kmpl. Which is little bit unexpected .,Suzuki
It's mileage is little bit less 30-35 which is not good and dont give more mileage which we need the most and it's very important for us. But this is fail to give good mileage.,Suzuki
"It's reliable, comfortable and simply awesome with some new features. I have covered above 2, 500 kms and now I can says go buy it. Best Deal for road trip lovers. Mileage is really awesome",Suzuki
It's suspension is very comfortable for me.I can ride it easily without any hesitation.,Suzuki
"It's the scooter from Suzuki that can suit the likes of different generations. A super bike that has been manufactured to stand the test of time over generations.. A product that has the best basic features like design, engine, pick up, speed, economy, mileage and sturdiness. I loved this scooter from the day it entered my life. It makes life so interesting, and travelling a great experience. The first of it's kind in the 125cc segment, which responds so briskly and brilliantly to acceleration. It just glides like a bullet, cruising at very high speeds even in the difficult traffic conditions. All suzuki two wheelers have that unique technology wherein there's Nil friction or holding back by the engine during reduction in throttle. Its a dream vehicle. Suzuki are not giving enough advertising for such a brilliant product... I feel that the sales of Suzuki Access 125 does not reflect its brilliance!.. A product that deserves more.. It makes its owners more relaxed because it takes away the entire pressure off its owner... Just Happiness and Joy...",Suzuki
Its 125cc engine gives good pick up. Suspention is good. Comes with tubeless tyres. But the best part is the looks. The design is classy. Colors are rich.,Suzuki
"Its 125cc engine is really powerful. If you buy this bike with accessories its looks are going to enhance. If we talked about its pickup it just fabulous. Mileage is less as compared to Activa 5g. Road grip is also a strong factor of this bike. Its mat black colour is looking amazing. I fall in love with this one. If we talk about comfort, its a really good.",Suzuki
Its a competative world of scooter and suzuki is the brand when it comes to bike.,Suzuki
Its a first bike I bought in my life.It is wonderous with 125 cc engine which is very powerful compared to other scooters. Its top speed is 102 km/h which I own have rode on highway its comes with good average.I was able to get full comfort in my access but after 2-3 years its got rough and hard to sit. Its front mudguard is very weak after some time it makes sounds.In handling its very good and safe as isaid its has a very good pickup the man sitting behing can fall down if we raise too fast.But overall it is nice and its mileage is 40 km/lt wich is good.,Suzuki
Its a good machine to ride. Satisfies the need of comfort while riding.,Suzuki
Its a good sccoty best for any time to used and no problem suzuki is a best 125 cc new 125 cc engine with sep tecnology new design elements with optional front disk brake .,Suzuki
"Its a great scooty by Suzuki , I am personally using it from around 6 months Still giving a great average near about 55km/litr , which is quite good",Suzuki
Its a smooth ride decent for loacal use in moderate traffic. Ideal for female drivers owing to its light weight.,Suzuki
Its also easy to drive even the body don't look bulky and also the new model offers disc break and also charging pot.,Suzuki
Its automatic dont worry about shifting gears. the wheel base is broader giving enough wet grip but cruising on this during turns should be avoided.,Suzuki
Its been 5 days I have bought Access scooter from Bhaiji Suzuki Pune.Within 3 days the handle started vibrating and when I called the showroom guy to complaint this he told me to contact Mechanic and not him. Secondly they delayed in allotting us number plate with number.,Suzuki
Its been 5 months scince I have bought this amazing scooty .absolutely smooth vehicle .wheels with larger diameter longer seat .big lights n spaceous area in front .i gaurantee u will enjoy its ride.it will be goodbfor,Suzuki
"Its been 7years, My access 125 is giving me an average of 60 - 63Kmpl. The engine power is good and the engine's response to a quick throttle is amazing. Keeping an average speed of 40-60Kmph gives you 60-63Kmpl. When compared to the other 125cc scooters engine's performance is super.",Suzuki
Its been 9 years after am using the suzuki access 125. I bought this scooter neglecting the honda activa which was prime scooter in 2009. But the experience with this scooter was immense pleasure till today. 125 cc with 9 bhp is very good in scooters back in 2009 where 100 cc scooters ruling the roads. The pickup is very fast. Engine is smooth. Believe or not I hit 90 kmph in a scooter in my earlier rides. I even took 2 people and a gas cylinder which were almost 150 kg without a hazzle. It could run up the hill very smartly with the weight. The long seats is the best in its class. Road grip was very swtisfying with mrf tyres. Access 125 was the first 125 cc scooter introduced by the suzuki back in 2008. Maintainance was low. Riding comfort was very good. Mileage I used to het around 40 kmpl. For 125 cc its a good mileage figure. It had a great appeal. I bought it for 52k on road back in 2009. Now its around 80k I guess. If u cant afford vespa 125 or aprilia sr 150 you can opt to suzuki access 125 eyes closed. It gives all the good features which you want in a scooter. Its the best scooter experince I had for 8 years.,Suzuki
Its been a year since I am using this scooty. Earlier from that I had another scooty from other company but believe me it is very very helpful than that one.,Suzuki
"Its been over a year since I bought this scooter. It cant be claimed to be the best but its a really great vehicle at its price. The mileage of the vehicle is also not so bad, top speed is also really satisfying. I have no issues or complaints till date except for an issue regarding the breaks, but it got fixed and now the scooter is just fine and fit. The look and design is quite good and catchy. I bought the red varient and it suits me quite good. It has a mobile charging socket in it , like in the cars which is a really helpful feature.",Suzuki
"Its been the worst in case of following aspects. It's bad thing is that it dont provide good services to its owners. Even its own service center . they charges high and just no improvement in the vehicle performance. Its fuel consumption is high which is around 35 km/litre which is a way low as compared to other vehicles like Activa , jupiter and others. Look is just avrrage but its head light don't illuminate much. Overall I would say it's not good if we look at its price. Really not on the marks - Suzuki.",Suzuki
Its body structure also waste because if it touches any metal or something it sis breakable.And engine chasiss also 125 but it did not reaches maximum.It is not designed for the heavy mud trails.It has 6000rpm engine but not capable for heavy loads .This may affect more on a small family or small business persons,Suzuki
"Its broad seating arrangement ensures that rider doesn’t get tired on the long distance driving I drove this at a stretch of 100km and really the ride was enjoyable. Its 35 watt halogen bulb ensures that you have clear visibility in the night. Even at the high speed braking is good, vehicle come at smooth stop.",Suzuki
"Its comfort is very good, it is easy to handle, it is mostly useful specialy during traffic time we can put any big weights in this scutty frount, it can carry a heavy load handling and controlling is very easy, it seems to be a very good bike, this bike can be used for both men and women its light arrangement is very fantastic",Suzuki
Its complitily solid and strong .its assecerige is stylish and modern its mileage is 55-60 klm per litter petrol .,Suzuki
Its different from the same boring honda activa look. And has that extra pickup which makes the ride more enjoyable. The quality of plastic used is not great when compared to honda.,Suzuki
Its driving good but after some problem in my scooter its very bad experience for it. It has 125cc great power engine therefor its not getting more power than its similar scooter gave.,Suzuki
Its engine and gear box has good power on indian roads .it has the same engine higher capacity.,Suzuki
Its engine heat in a high amount.   Its look and design very poor.,Suzuki
Its engine is heavy so it feels good to drive this. Mileage is also good not the best bt still good. And its very comfortable for long route.,Suzuki
Its engine is too smooth in running and give us good excitement.,Suzuki
Its engine power is good around 124 cc but it controlling system is not good. It is vibrating when we are travelling from roadside.,Suzuki
Its fiber body so carfully drive. I also uncofortable to sit. Its not good. When I drive 50 -60 km then its back pained me. So I avoid long drives. Its 20-30 km range only preferd. Its avrage is neary 50 -55 km.,Suzuki
"Its fuel consumption too is supposed to be in the region of 48 to 50 Kms. with the lowest supposed to be 45 Km.  This feature itself puts it at least 5 km ahead of the best selling scooter from Honda.  That too, with more power at your disposal.  Its like eating the cake and having it too!",Suzuki
Its gives normally 60 km/hr if you run economically and if you run at high speed then it gives average of 35 to 40km/hr/ The suspension is also better then the other bikes in same categary. The porn in this bike is that in rainy season the water easilily enter in filter and then you need to change the same. Except water enterng issue the bike is more friendely and comfort to ride.i will suggest to others to purchase the same.,Suzuki
Its glass system is seapret from other company .so its looks great.,Suzuki
Its got a much powerful engine than the others in this price range it is a 125 cubic engine that delivers a peppy acceleration than others but if mileage is your concern then plz dont go for this as it gives a very low mileage I have done a few tests but it could get to manage 35-40 top I driven it in economy speed which is 40 to 50 but then also the results dosen't vary much . And if talking about design its looks arent much good compared to other vechicles in the market. For youngsters looks matter but it dosen't seems to have a good design .,Suzuki
Its handle is quiet different for some people who go for access from activa or anyone else because its handle is little bit short in length but its grip is awesome and their is no issue in controlling the scooter because it is light in weight.,Suzuki
Its helps you to stop the bike while you are on road quick and easily.,Suzuki
Its higher setup of handle bar gives more control and confidence to the rider over the scooter. The floorboard is longer and wider which provides more area for legs. Seat is also wide and cushioned well. The placement of foot rests for the pillion rider is at the perfect place.,Suzuki
Its look very good as compare to other mopeds.new access looks like vespa.,Suzuki
Its looked like Activa Honda  but its not like that. its looking nice but not comfortable for long drive after 100km its want to take break.,Suzuki
Its milage was too.poor and was approximately giving me a milage of 30-35kmpl which I personally didnot like.,Suzuki
Its mileage is average which will gives you 30+ mileage kmpl but this mileage is not so good for buying this.,Suzuki
Its mileage is very poor.  It takes lots of petrol.  My all pocket money finished in petrol. It is not comfortable due to small seats.  Its breake does not work properly. Some times its self start does not work properly. Its tyre works on road very badly.  And engine produce heat.,Suzuki
Its my first scooter and I have good experience its really good for me.,Suzuki
"Its new digital meter display, chrome fittings in the front looks amazing and eye catchy.",Suzuki
Its now more then 20000 kilometers . Ther is not a single problem and maintainance. I'm have booked another access for my friends. But ther is some delay in vehicle delivery.,Suzuki
"Its one of the best scooter i've ever tested, Nice pick up Smooth driving.You can even use in hilly place like noth east part of india. Fuel comsumption is low Comparing to other scooters, and you got perfect sitting position With comfort cushioning, Handling is also quite comfort, the height is not that good but For ladies that might be an advantage",Suzuki
Its pavilion rider footrest is very stylish. It has also got good storage space. The petrol tank has a capacity of 6 Lt. It is good for a long journey.The seat has good cushion which is good for Indian roads. The front telescopic shock will give a better handling for the Indian roads.,Suzuki
Its performance is very nice only for first month but after one month it showing some problems or some missings that why I am saying Suzuki access 125 is not a good scooter so dont buy this scooter,Suzuki
Its pirce is 61000 Showroom tells its gaves malige 1liters per 64km but truth is 45. in high way its maybe 50km . its very comfort to campera to activa 3g. 3 member set comfortabe. its engine proformance very high power 8.40bhp maxpower and 124cc engine . and 102 kg. 1 cylinder .bore is 52 mm stroke 57valvels cylinder is 2 rear wheel is drum and front is disk and normal. handind power is good and very esay to control .this soctey. tells about looks his very dashing on colour .,Suzuki
"Its price is around 65, 000 which is very more according to its condition.",Suzuki
Its really good for a little cute family. Mailage is about 65km easily go a woman with her kids for school market every where maitance is little costly. This are all told by my friend but am really confused.,Suzuki
"Its reliability is also cool. The road grip is amazingly sensitive than the other vehicles, we can feel that in the curves.",Suzuki
Its seating aire is comfort and its easy to handel with air and its fully comfortable when ride this scuty .,Suzuki
Its service with customer saticefaction.its make service with fully origenal parts . So its good scoty for me and my family.,Suzuki
Its split seats are comfortable and gives the feel of compelte sports bike . Rear person has to use the otherwise he will feel slipery every time,Suzuki
"Its square headlight and new design make it super. if you are in search of powerful, comfortable and",Suzuki
"Its square headlight and new design make it super.if you are in search of powerful, comfortable and many space you should buy this scooter.",Suzuki
"Its square headlight and new design makes it to look awesome.If you are in search of powerful and comfortable with many space to keep things inside, you should buy this scooter.",Suzuki
"Its start giving a lot of problem, like issue with start plug, kick was not working properly, chock was just for name never work. many problem occur with this engine 1 year back, I paid 9000 rupees to service center for engine repairs and they guranteed that it will not creat any problem and within 2 month. its starting a creating a lot of problem again.",Suzuki
"Its supernatural, very comfortable, stylish lamp, great bike.",Suzuki
"Its the most succesful scooter according to me with agrat controllong , superb 4stroke engine air cooled system it has a lage storage as compared to activa and jupiter. And its new stunning look has attracted me most . In comfort also it has an outstanding performance wich comes with front telescopic suspension and rear air compressing shoch absorber .",Suzuki
Its too early to comment on mileage.But I expect better than my Actica.1 good point I like about Activa is its resale value (I got 21000 for a 2004 model which driven 60000 kms).good one.,Suzuki
Its vary comfortable bike for girls and for a milage to ride this bike no need any help. Girs enjoy varry much,Suzuki
Its very famous in my city. Almost half of the population has this scooter as it is cheap and useful. It does not have enough speed but it help alot in small journies. It also have a garentee. Its really amazing. But nowadays other bikes are getting famous which sare undoubtly main cause of accident because of their high speed,Suzuki
Its very smooth and its milage is more compared to any other muppet,Suzuki
Its very unreliable if your are driving on lonely roads as there is no breakdown support.Take note of all these maintenance issues and expensive parts before buying. Mohan Prakash G,Suzuki
"Its worst scooter,  worst product from Suzuki. Scooter stopped automatically while running, it is not sure it cannot starts until 1 hour or may be 1 day. I have purchased the vehicle on 2012.Currenly I found hard crunch sound form engine.",Suzuki
It’s been 4th service I’m doing and my SUZUKI ACCESS 125 is jerking all the way in the morning because of some clutch issue. I was raised this complaint from the first service onwards and they have only one answer that this is common for Suzuki bikes. I don’t what they means of it. After all they are over charging in the name of each replacement. Like I mentions below,Suzuki
"It’s not really one to make you drool in awe, but the all new Access does look more sleek and contemporary than the older model. It looks more toned and dynamic than before with new body panels and there are even some chrome and other bits like the clear turn indicator lights that appear quite tasteful on this scooter. In fact, the new version is around 10kg lighter than the older model. There’s even a 3D ‘Access’ logo on its flanks, and an aluminium grab rail.",Suzuki
"It’s the worst scooter.. worst product by Suzuki. From day one, it gave me trouble always. Scooter stops automatically while running, makes lots of noise in just 3 months and the service center of Suzuki Hyderabad are not able to sort out the problem and not responding properly it seems as they are untrained. They have changed 5-6 batteries, charger, charging wire, lock in 2-3 months, even which were already working, but they changed them , don’t know why they did this?",Suzuki
Ive had suzuki 125 and activa both and suzuki failed to impress me.,Suzuki
Ive had suzuki 125 and activa both and suzuki neglected to awe me.,Suzuki
"I’m totally unsatisfied with this scooty. As I bought this scooty in November 2021. I was so happy enough to ride this scooty, But after 4 months I started facing issues in self start button, seriously it was such a worst experience because after that I was started using kick to start it and it was taking such a long time to start.",Suzuki
I’ve been riding Access 125 from past 3 years never had any problems,Suzuki
Just Bought Access 125 in Surat.! No doubt its a great scooter with great mileage and comfort. It has big tyres with good road gripp. Mobile charger point  is given in front with pocket so you can easily charge. It has average maintance cost. It is giving me 45kmpl average which is good enough for the city. Highly recomended. Love the quality of body design plus new design with decent price.,Suzuki
"Just I purchased Suzuki Access 125 after comparing both technical, utility and cost of other scooterates. I'm happy with the vehicle in respect of both performance and value for money.",Suzuki
"Just a small twist and the vehicle started to move with gusto.  Now I started thinking; this scooter is moving with more zest than even my own bike.  Well, well I must temper my throttle opening with more care.  Before I could think further, the scooter was in the thick of fast moving traffic and doing quite well for itself; I must say.  It could dart in and out of the vehicles with a response that was almost telepathic.  In short no great effort was required to make me look like an expert in the riding department.  This should be quite reassuring to the new riders who will have ample power on tap to make for a safe and exciting ride.",Suzuki
Just selling a vehicle to customers is not enough you should provide good service. Should maintain a skilled mechanics in service centers. If you go For service means the mechanic /helpers will create new problem to vehicle. At the end the problem will not solve.,Suzuki
Just thought of sharing my reviews on the bike I own from past 3.5 years.,Suzuki
"Just wanted to let you know the details in advance. Let me recieve the vehicle and I will write a complete review once I use it Thanks, Om. Dt 17/03/10: Question to the folks who went for a loan on Access. Have you piad an additional rs. 350/- for making ecs and another rs. 350/- for making affidavit (because you only submitted land line bill as address proof and it is not a government supplied one)? I am pressurized due to the fact that the show room people are saying that this is common for all the loans on the bikes.",Suzuki

Last week I gifted Suzuki access 125 to my sister on her birthday. I have gone through the complete guide before buying it and its sounds me better scooter at 125cc segment.,Suzuki
"Last year my father bought this scooty of suzuki and we didn't got good results. This scootu is not good, it starts creating a loud noise like ghrrrr ghrrr also it's engine starts closing. Also this scooty consume more petrol and didn't give us good milege. Also its engine is not long lasting, if we load a heavy weight on this it's engine got damaged. Also this scooty's design is not so attractive. Due to its poor satisfaction I disliked this scooty. And also it's tyre grip is not so well or not so good in rainy season it could slip or may be responsible for accident.",Suzuki
Last year my friend purchased suzuki access from our local showroom.i sometime ride his acess but it is very smooth and comfortable.it make no sound while riding.it is not best for long ride. three person can seat comfortably.if you need scquty for marketing then suzuki is best for city.it has both self and kick start with alloy tyre.i prefer honda activa 110 cc is better than suzuki acess because its engine and battery is powerful.it has 6 liter fuel capacity and great look.suzuki access is best for college girl.it need mainteance so make sure before you purchase suzuki access.it also sometime make time to start.so you need to aware before reach decision for buying.,Suzuki
"Last yr, I had a Long ride with my Access and it was well and fine matching to the other of my friends bikes with were Pulser, Yamaha, etc.",Suzuki
"Later when I enquired for it no one gave any concrete answer and higher management kept of delaying the delivery date and asked to contact sometime laterSecondly, behavior with their customers is very bad and rude.- The sales representative at the desk and the Manager’s behavior with the client is very bad. After the booking is made their behavior changes drastically and they do not pay any heed to their future customers requirements and they treat them secondary priority.",Suzuki
"Leave aside the engine, clutch and brake damage you are causing, and the consequential expensive repairs and premature parts failure.",Suzuki

Let me tell my review on my vehicle suzuki access 125 which I bought about 2.5 years back white color.,Suzuki
"Let me tell you friends how this scooty i.e Suzuki's Access 125 was not that good for me. Firstly let me tell you that I brought this scooty about 12 months ago and used it for only 6 months and then I was forced to sell it because, I really had a very bad experience with it.",Suzuki
"Let me thank many reviewers of this scooter in Mouthshut. You guys have done it again, another value added product with the best points. Will be soon adding my reviews and experience.",Suzuki
Let us talk about negative aspect even though it is not negative but practical things. My kinetic was light weight and it used to zoom the moment you accelerate but Suzuki access is bit lazy to start with due to its heavy body which is hindrance in Bangalore traffic condition.,Suzuki
"Let's get styling out of the way. Suzuki has reworked practically every panel on the new Access 125. The front apron and mudguard are metal and the rest of the body is plastic. The front panel paints the picture of a solid, reliable, mature scooter. The sides are sharper and sleeker but I do wish the exhaust swept up like the rest of the body. That said, as with the Indian Suzukis so far, overall quality is terrific. Panel fit is excellent and the build feels like it will not rattle for years. There are gaps between the chrome head light surround and the actual sealed beam, ditto indicators and apron but they're only visible up close and in nitpick mode.",Suzuki

Light in weight. Good in looks but high in maintenance. Spare parts are not easily available in the market.,Suzuki

"Look astute masses may love get to however I adored the downplayed look of activa. So for a layman should they go for a 125 cc bike or should they go for a 102 cc Activa … . Fascinating isn't it. Taken a toll savvy scarcely there's any distinction as on street cost in my area(Thane) is 47250 for Access without a hold up period and Activa retails at 46000+. One has better an incentive for cash in Access, more power, same efficiency, same unwavering quality and a superior services(Honda has a horrid administration and subsequently nothing can be most exceedingly terrible then this… .actually encountered this and encountering this till date). Yes one thing that Access needs is they have not forcefully pushed the vehicle like Bajaj Kristal, Hero Honda Pleasure and so on… and subsequently you may not hear much. Be that as it may, test drive this item and you will witness the prevalence and dependability for yourself… however its somewhat on costlier side.",Suzuki
Look of the scooter is good. Sound of it is ok. Suspension it perfect.,Suzuki
"Look of the vehicle really impress you because vehicle is available so many different colors like red, white, metallic black and many more,",Suzuki
"Look wise masses may love access but I loved the understated look of activa. So for a layman should they go for a 125 cc scooter or should they go for a 102 cc Activa …. Interesting isn’t it. Cost wise hardly there’s any difference as on road price in my area(Thane) is 47250 for Access without a wait period and Activa retails at 46000+. One has better value for money in Access, more power, same fuel economy, same reliability and a better services(Honda has a dismal service and hence nothing can be worst then this….personally experienced this and experiencing this till date). Yes one thing that Access lacks is they have not aggressively pushed the vehicle like Bajaj Kristal, Hero Honda Pleasure etc… and hence you may not hear much. But test drive this product and you will witness the superiority and reliability for yourself…though its slightly on costlier side.",Suzuki
Looks .iam happy with looks as its good looks and finishing.ofcourse rear shape and looks pretty average overall ok.fibre and metallic finishing package is ok .but speedometer is too awkward and old fashioned .front heat lamps almost same like vespa too short and sleeky but illumination good focus in nite times good .horn is ok indicator lites placement is good .front mud guard is metallic finishing is ok but place for leg room slightly lower.locikng system is good and common almost allthe scooters today.seating is good comfortable for duos but slightly would have been wider like maestro.boot space is damn very good for enough space .fuel tank is too less only 5 ltrs but ol for city rides.overall ok,Suzuki
Looks .its product handling control not comfortable.its bike not a most for travel. I have a one bike but I am not satisfied this suzuki access125 . So I recommonded dont purchase this product .its not succes this product.,Suzuki
Looks a stunner( I looked at other access that were older and they all look good) the paint job is good.,Suzuki
Looks and Feel- Access 125 looks very decent in metal and fiber body. It looks very different from all vehicle in its class.,Suzuki
Looks are really elegent. Good trimming. Seat and handle distance is bigger,Suzuki
"Looks can be deceiving. From my observation, the Access styling is well rounded, sleek and better than most of it's competitors. The styling may be understated compared to other scooters but the performance and mileage is awesome and unbelievable! As someone rightly mentioned, this scooter is like an athlete in a Kanjeevaram dress!",Suzuki
Looks is also very good in comparision with other vehicles in field.completly suit for a gentleman personality.i have a white color access and I am very happy with product,Suzuki
Looks of this scooter are very poor actually its back look is very bad then its front look.,Suzuki
Looks really chic the biggish tail light at the back looks just fine. The exhaust gets a stylish chrome plated cover and the foot pegs are soooo cute but Activa too is a looker.,Suzuki
"Looks, driving performance, intial pick up, boot space.also good for long drive's",Suzuki
Looks- if we go to the looks then I must say that it beats all the competitors in the current market.,Suzuki
"Looks-looks of this 2 wheeler falls in an average category, as it is made of plastic body, speedometer looks like an antique piece, not a classy piece.",Suzuki
Looks: Old model didn't have great or catchy looks. New ones do have surely.,Suzuki
Looks: Talking about looks so looks are not very impressive it is similar to the last model of suzuki which was also a complete failure because of it's looks.,Suzuki
Looks: You will like it. Chrome finish around the headlamp gives it distinctive look from other scooters in the market.,Suzuki
Lot of Vibrations and noises coming out from various Parts of the Vehicle while riding on Inclined roads.,Suzuki
Low maintenance with only routine service at 1500-2000 km  in local garages,Suzuki
"Low pretrol conjuction .low maintention , good tayer quitly.fine engine.This is also very high weight to ran.",Suzuki
"Luckily I got Access within month. First start of engine was smooth as silk, so is the ride making firm with front telescopic suspension, good leg room, excellent under seat compartment. Its certainly better then Honda. List but not as all says head lamp focus needs correction also it would have been easy with press headlamps switch for temporary use. So far I haven't pulled her above 60Km/hr. still there you can feel the urge of power. I am sure it can easily touch 80-90Km/hr.",Suzuki
MAY GIVE U STARTING TROUBLE WHEN NOT USED FOR TWO DAYS(I FACED).,Suzuki

"MILEAGE IS TOO LOW. NEVER EXCEED 28-29 KM/LITRE. FUEL CONSUMPTION IS TOO MUCH. ALREADY COVERED 3200 KMS. DEALER TRIED BUT FAILED.

MY FAMILY HAVE PURCHASED THIS VECHICLE LONG AGO AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT THIS VECHILE IS NOT GOOD FOR HIGH SPEED JOURNEY IT STARTS GETTING HEATED UP AND STARTS TO VIBRATES AND WOWELLS ABOVE 60 KM/ HR.BUT ITS FUEL EFFICIENCY IS GOOD.IT SOMES DOES WORK FOR ME.,Suzuki
MY PARENTS SAID THAT WHY ARE YOU BUYING THIS SCOOTY INSTEAD OF BUYING A SPORTS BIKE THEN I TELL THEN ITS FEATURES THAT IT GIVES SO MUCH OF MILEAGE AND IT IS LESS POLLUTES VEHICLE AND I TOLD THEN THAT IT HAS A BATTERY POINT IN IT AND IT IS AVAILABLE IN DIFFERENT COLURS THEN MY DECIDED TO BY THOS SUZUKI ACCES 125 FOR ME THAT'S ALL.,Suzuki
MY uncle brought this scooter he was happy to drive this scooter. I can say that suzuki company is one of the best company. Suzuki access 125 comfort to drive. The suzuki access 125  is the fiagship model in the company scooter,Suzuki
Made for the common person while bringing great looks and style in its body.,Suzuki
"Main consideration I had while I bought this scooter was - Performance, Sturdiness, Looks and space.",Suzuki
"Maintenance staff did not do their job properly, simply connected the air pipe and said all is fine, faced same problem after 7 days, again had to take the bike to the showroom, this time they fixed it by cutting the pipe and re-attaching.",Suzuki
Maintenance:  As per me I used to change engine oil for every 2000 kms ans get it serviced for every 4000kms.,Suzuki
Maitanance: Access125 spares are cheap compared to other scooters. But I think it has least maintainance.,Suzuki
Major reason we cant stop the accidents if we are over-speeding.,Suzuki
Make sure tyre pressure is upto the recommended level every 3 days . As it will impact the riding conditions and the mileage level.,Suzuki
Make sure you have physically verify before buying. and very bad mileage and very bad average . not a smart bike. I think not go with this bike.,Suzuki
Many companies are making scooter bikes for both male and female.,Suzuki
"Many model showing and then decided buy only Suzuki Access 125 because attractive colours, attractive design and more spaces provide to other model and also average, very nice and success full model. In this model also available digital Meyer and also safety in lock button and comfortable seating.",Suzuki
"Many of my friends have different scooties such as activa, dio, pleasure etc. and when ever we race I used to be first. I have also used activa which is very popular scooty and I have noticed that activa can reach maximum speed of 80 km/h and access can reach maximum speed of 95 or 100 km/h and it also has better acceleration that activa. on one hand it got better speed and acceleration and on other hand feel that activa is more easy to handle that access. while driving access you feel lots of power as it have a powerful engine of 128 cc. and on other hand activa have 110 cc engine. but as you get more power and speed in this engine you also get some what less mileage. I am not saying that it do not have good mileage.",Suzuki
Many of the Activa owners complained about the bad mileage they get despite good driving etc..which made me inclinate to Suzuki Access. Also Acess being more powerful and latest scooter many flaws in this segment would be addressed in this.,Suzuki
"Market is full of options in scooters and one cant test drive all of them for few km(mostly they let u drive 1/2km) and decide which one is best for him. ACTIVA is common name for scooters now a day's. Choosing a perfect scooters for own is a task and is u have to choose for other, it will become a big big task. I had to choose scooter for my DAD which can be drive my other members for family if needed.",Suzuki
"Maruthi is a indias most lovable company which has produced the most valuable vehicles till now but the Suzuki Access 125 is not one of them there are very big problems with this vehicles, Initially while release of the vehicle the maruthi claimed it to be a youth friendly vehicle but it fails to live up to the expectation the mileage of the vehicle is very poor and does not deserve the price they offer for, the controls are very hard and its not of rider friendly control, The road grip is very poor because of controls it has",Suzuki
"Maruthi knows to do good value added vehicles but when it comes to the Suzuki Access 125 the maruthi people forgotten to do it better, as my sister had bought this vehicle for her personal use even I used to ride it when I needed but the control of this two wheeler is very bad and does not give very comfortable control while on ride, the fuel efficiency is also not so good as the old two wheeler, looks is some what looks good overall not a recommendable vehicle",Suzuki
Max Power: 8.40 bhp @ 7.000 rpm and Spark Plugs 1 Per Cylinder.,Suzuki
Maximum Torgue 10.20 Nm @ 5.000 rpm and cooling systems is Air Cooled.,Suzuki
Mechanics and guys at petrol stations recommend ridiculously high pressures,Suzuki
Met with minor accidents couple of times due to Brake failures.,Suzuki
"Meter console, Style good looks but the front seems little bad, gets good paint quality stylish easy readable Feels comfortable and easily manueverable through tough traphic condition, handle bar could be a little bit bigger and taller because in bikes it may taller, I likes that cofort of handling. Brakes feels good but it locks the wheel and it causes the wear and tear of tyres, if it 130 mm and little softer it will be the best ever in this segment and develop cbs(for front like tvs wego)",Suzuki
Might spoil your habits: You might forget how slippery Indian made tires are - in case you need to ride another person's vehicle.,Suzuki
"Milage, comfort is average but pickup is not good of this scooty.",Suzuki
Mileage - 37 - 45 but for 125 cc scooter with good performance this is not too bad.,Suzuki
"Mileage - I am getting 38km/litre. I suggest that be below 50 km speed to get good mileage, the scooter is gas guzzler if driven above 60 kmph.",Suzuki
"Mileage - This is the only set back, in Bangalore city condition, I am getting around 32 max. but compromised with great pick up.",Suzuki
Mileage - if we talk about its mileage it gives only 35kmpl - 40kmpl mileage over road and its not good for this kind of scooty.,Suzuki
Mileage : - If we talk about its mileage it would be around 40-45 km per litre and have a large fuel tank than many other scooties.,Suzuki
Mileage : I want to check this after first service. I feel I am getting around 40. That should be fine with me as we cant expcet much from auto gear scooter.,Suzuki
Mileage achievable 50-52 kmpl. But with consistent and economical riding between 40-60kph speed,Suzuki
Mileage is 44Kmpl overall. Highway-52-55 Kmpl City- 40-44 Kmpl.(Tank to tank basis),Suzuki
"Mileage is above 40, not sure how much but definitely lesser than a bike. the fuel tank is only 6 liters( with petrol prices rising the tank will eventually start feeling too big )",Suzuki
Mileage is also better for this scooty and my sister loved this bike.,Suzuki
Mileage is also good.Comfortable seating and drives smooth even loaded with 170 kgs on it.,Suzuki
Mileage is low it should be given more mileage because price of fuel up day by day,Suzuki
Mileage is not as per the dealer said and the body structure like mudgaurd is made up of plastic .after some time it creats a noise that not feeling good,Suzuki
Mileage is not that very big issue because mileage is normal. but if you want high mileage bike or scooty then dont go for this scooty.,Suzuki
"Mileage is only 40 or 45. (better to fill full tank instead of 2 ltr or 4 ltr ) to know the actual ltr filled in by the petrol bunk guy keep the key in on position while getting the petrol filled in the petrol bunk and the petrol indicator red colour needle will go up to ""F""(full) if the petrol bunk guy has filled the petrol correctly or it will be at different level.",Suzuki
Mileage of the scooty is good and the engine is also well refined   but the build of the scooty is not upto the mark as chaep quality is being used.,Suzuki
Mileage of this bike is better that the other and this like is very comfortable.,Suzuki
"Mileage output is 40kmpl after servicing which gets reduced to 35kmpl when servicing is due.Pick up has decreased over the years, changes rear tyre for the second time as it had worn out.Odometer crashed at 28000 kms due to breaking of the cable joint during riding for which it was replaced with new.Currently odometer total is 46000 kms.",Suzuki
Mileage though is a big issue. Drinks like an old Scottish man.,Suzuki
Mileage- I'm not very impressed with the mileage. I'm getting around 38-40kms per litre. Hope it will increase after few services. Today I just gave my bike for 3 rd service.,Suzuki
Mileage-Company says that it gives you mileage of nearly 64 kmpl but it gives arround 50-55 kmpl.,Suzuki
Mileage:  In this bike accept good mileage in nearly 65KM per litre. In this bike engine environment is cooling and powerful one. It is choose best choice. In long drive making in this bike give good mileages. In this bike didn't take more fuel compare to other brand bikes.,Suzuki
"Mileage: - As this bike has 125 cc engine, while buying they tell you that it gives 45 kmpl average. Its true for only first 2 months after that it gives average of 35-40 kmpl even in city like Pune which is good.",Suzuki
Mileage: 32-35 kms /litre in Bangalore city and 44-47kms / litre in Bangalore Rural,Suzuki
"Mileage: This bike provides me mileage of 60-65 km/l and on highways its provides me 65-70/l. The best part of this bike is mileage, as I stay in delhi and I have office in gurgaon which is around 35 km far from my home .",Suzuki
Mileage: it is good compared to old one  gives a mileage of approximately 40kmph in local areas or cities and gives 50 at highway but mileage depends on user driving conditions and some traffic conditions.overall it is poor in mileage,Suzuki
Milege means evry condition and setuation for astimate .because a persion offert this wike becauae midille. Cnass person wants some thing diffent .so this eike very good as looking hendling and belence also.this wike have good balence. And evrege are very good and wikes loks also good and head light is very have good focus vry good .at to point. The well and tair good so it is the good for any persion . So try this wike think diffrent and we trust is on suzuki qulity evry time good sevicing,Suzuki
Milleage the milage of this scooty is veryy good and nice. Pick up is really wonderfull the accelaration of this scooty is really amazing .,Suzuki
Mind blowing pickup.family scooter .full mark.love to long drive .springing fantastick .storage system sufficient for family.indicator is too good.mileage is good .comport is good.I like to ride on this .Reliability is very good.road grip is ok.i suggest you if ur budget is upto 60k then it is ok for u .auto starter and battery is good.headlight focus is good mirror adjustment is optional if u want to remove u can.,Suzuki
"Mob no.9974351103 Suzuki accesss does not take their own scooters in Suzuki's company, but they do not even have the market value of the company, but the company does not even answer the same. Neither the new Suzuki access vehicle is taking the mistake.",Suzuki
Mobile charger port is provided which is very helpful while travelling,Suzuki
"More surprising was the response from the Showroom. When I called them up. They just said that please bring the vehilcle to the service center. We can imagine the plight. I am on the middle of the road with rear wheel jammed and you are getting such a response from the service center. That too, just a few minutes, you have been just back from death. Fortunately, I was riding the vehicle at around 25 - 30 and there was no vehicle coming from back at fast speed. Thereby I was saved.",Suzuki
Moreover at the same time we had tried with Thiruvalla Suzuki  (PATHANAMTHITTA Branch) there the service station staff said they are ready to do the service but will on chargeable basis only. In fact your's team members are very very Unprofessional in terms of customer services.we will not entertain this types of dealing here after so please give proper guidance to your team members for avoiding to loose your  valid customers in future.,Suzuki
Moreover the style and design of this bike is moder and attractive looks stylish.,Suzuki
"Most Comfortable, stylish looking and sturdy vehicle. I got mileage of around 45 kmpl. The mileage probably depends upon the user himself and his handling and the way of riding.I can also go up to 50 kmpl or can go down to 35 kmpl. proper care needs to be taken in terms of its servicing and the oil should be changed from time to time. the vehicle is very stylish looking and is very comfortable to ride. the acceleration is also very powerful and it is a completely reliable vehicle. I would strongly recommend this moped to all those who are looking forward to buy one.",Suzuki
Most important is mileage as we cannot expect more but iam getting 40 to 45 kmpl ol rite.,Suzuki
"Most of the colours are available for quick deliveries and even if they don't have stock, they can get it in 10 days which is really nice whereas for activa you endup waiting for 45-60days which is the case since years since the vehicle was launched.",Suzuki
"Most of the reviews I read about this vehicle have mentioned the focus being too high! However, the focus can be set right easily by adjusting a nut just below the headlamp. Wonder what do the showroom guys do in the so called Pre Delivery Inspection check apart from charging customers for it!!",Suzuki
Moving on to looks it do not have a nery nice looks and as I mentioned above also the body is very damagable and light the balancing of the scooty is very poor because of its light weight and in the end I would say you that you should not buy this scooty and waste money you can get a very nice scooty in this much amount and enjoy.i can only suggest otherwise its your choice.,Suzuki
Moving to comfort I would say you that you should buy another scooty like activa or aviator or jupiter which you will enjoy driving than this scooty I have noticed that the self of the scooty gets tornned of very early abd you have to kick start it.,Suzuki

My Cousin sister using this Suzuki access since a long time and she seems every time in trouble due to its very poor product quality and not good performance,Suzuki
My Thought;- If You are female still a decent chioce but give it a second think. If you are Male do not think too much. It is concerned paying so less go for it.,Suzuki

My advice if you want to a comfort vehicle for girls so you take a right step.you can those who works who you can not do on a Bike.,Suzuki
My battery gone dead because of not using for 2 months when I went out of my place so be careful.,Suzuki
My bikes selfstarter motor Is gone.not even 4 month's old.and service centre is another big head headache.no road grip clutch problem no mileage I suggest activa is a better bet.,Suzuki
My bro has been using the bike I did a ride on this bike its really amazing. its mileage is much better it covers 6400km per liter. it is light weighted and easy to handle. its wheels run smoothly on a road and give a very comfortable ride wheels are made up of sheet metal that give it a strong and decent grip on the road. it has a strong and most demanding appeal. one of the good scooty . I really like it.,Suzuki
My brother has bought a bike that's pulsar it's best bike but yet my bro feels comfortable to ride my scooty only & doesn't rides that bike more.,Suzuki
"My brother owns this vehicle and am very satisfied with its features and perfomance . Best in ride with standard milege. Capable of seating any kind of persons. As it is stylish and maintained with well capable features as alloy wheels , disk break . Specially its switch with 3 qualities. Best storage capacity!",Suzuki
"My college is so far to my village. There is no transportation facilities to my village. Daily ineed to travel in auto. If I miss the auto I will miss my classes. Auto charges also very high. So, my mother decided to brought me a bike. I don't know about bikes, my father divided to brought access 125. I feel very happy. The bike is still in good condition. I brought the bike in 2014. Now it is in good condition",Suzuki
"My companion have taken Suzuki get to 125 in walk 2017.this model bicycle have a few issues like vibration, getting more stable in motor and furthermore extremely poor mileage it gives around 30 KMPL. Starting at now 2 administrations are finished yet at the same time confronting previously mentioned problems.the same I have educated to Suzuki get to benefit focus they said like once cross more than 5000KM at that point will get pickup. As far as I can tell and propose to u folks don't go and purchase this sort of vehicle.",Suzuki
"My cousin bought an Access but within a week due to some family emergency, gave the bike to me. This gave me about 25 kmpl on road, cheap battery and skidding on sudden braking.",Suzuki
My dad bought this vehicle and he gifted it to me for my colledge. at start I thought that scooty is not what I want I want and is slow and very fuel consuming. but suzuki access is the beast performance with 125cc engine and good fuel consumption and fuel average of 55-60 liters/km. ive driven this scooty for at least 3-4 months and is very good experience to drive. with good fuel tank capacity. having good handling.,Suzuki
"My dad gifted me my first bike when I was in 12th standard{july 2003} n that bike was tvs victor now 2009 comes to an end I am still riding it, i fully satisfied with my victor.uptil this long journey I had with victor no single case was there where I had to spend 1000 bugs at one time, i could say it was a no maintence bike.but now I want to get rid of gears bikes.",Suzuki
"My dear friend, I am not defaming the Suzuki brand but this rang of Access scooters has spoil t the image of the company.",Suzuki
"My elder father is using this vehicle. Moreover, this vehicle is useful for whom they drive without gears. I feel a smooth going in car while I am driving on it. Mainly, the working of Shock absorbers is effective. Even at holes of the road, we could not feel any hard due to its shock absorbers.",Suzuki
My experience so far: Pick up as expected is super. Milage is 38 km/lit- very less may be because of my wife's learning & newness of the scooter. I think this should improve after first service. While crusing at constant speed engine sound is hardly audible. Handling of the scooter is very good. breaking OK.,Suzuki
My experience was the best with suzuki access is the best in catagery of 125 cc segnment but tge only issue is with body suzuki access has fiber body this should be inproved to metal body nyc scooter with bigger fuel tank bigger and comfertable seats for boath pillion and rider it comfrtable for daily commutung teenagers and ladies now it also comes in disk varient which is 8k to 10k higher in price then the drum varient u can go for it good scooter,Suzuki
"My family I have two bike I will suggest you to puchase this one, in city milage is also great for this range bike, back suspension on road is great even if any speed breaker is also there then you will feel like swing.one try is worth for this bike",Suzuki
My father bought it for him. After one year he gave it to me. It's simply superb.It's red colour is attractive. It's wheel base is some wat enough to turn in slide roads. Tt also runs easily on mountain roads. It's starting pick up also nice. Then it's hand bar is little shorter. That makes it handy. It suits for me.,Suzuki
My favourite colour is Silver because it looks decent. Value to buy! Go for it.,Suzuki
My friend approx 6.1 in height and as not issues riding or sitting back,Suzuki
My friend has it 2 months ago he purchased it I want to purchase it but the waitings is too much and I have a urgent need so I am planning for a different two wheelers which is easily available,Suzuki
My friend only told to me about this bike and I went to showroom to see this bike directly. It's displacement is 124cc. It's engine type is normal with 4 cycle with only one cylinder air cooled one. It's fuel type is petrol and drum type brake.,Suzuki
"My friend purchased this scooty 2 years back , this scooty is very comfertable on highway, I opend 105 top speed on a virar to dadar highway,",Suzuki
"My friend recently bought an Suzuki access 125 non-gear motor bike.Initially it was doing good, but when it was serviced for the second time there is where the problem started, the first thing that he noticed was mileage drop he started getting a mileage of just 30 kmpl .",Suzuki
"My friend two months ago purchased Suzuki access 125. I liked that scooter because nice look, 50kmpl millage,",Suzuki
My honest opinion about this muppet can be justified by giving a 4 out of five rating,Suzuki
My humble request to all of you is to be careful and ride at lawful speed level only.,Suzuki
"My in law owns an activa. Hence I am sure that the Access is definitely great in all aspects when compared to the Activa(I have driven the Activa on numerous occations, since he bought it new).",Suzuki

My mom purchased it and firstly it was going smooth but afterthat it showed its real image and we didn't liked it.,Suzuki
My mother had bought this scooter in around 2010. I use it now. It didn't have much problems initially for a couple of years. Gave mileage of 40-50 on highways. Maybe 35-40 in cities. But last few years I had to do a lot of servicing/repair work on it. The mileage has dropped down to 25-30(sometimes even less). All the garage mechanics suggest to stay away from this scooter. I'll write down the pros and cons what I had experienced in the last few years:,Suzuki
My name is Sahil nanda and I would like to share my views on Suzuki Access 125. My sister has this suzuki access 125 which I gifted in her birthday last year and I purchase a new model for her. The looks are so good it comes with tubeless tyres. There's no manual indication at all and the price of Suzuki Access 125 is nearly 61000 on showroom but the problem is the price is too high and the maintenance cost is also high. It gives me a mileage of 3235 km per litre only which is comparatively less and which they mentioned in the booklets is totally wrong so I would not suggest you to purchase Suzuki Access 125 cc scooty. thank you,Suzuki
My neighbour bought this vehicle about a couple of months ago. The scooty looks good but there are many problems which are very heart breaking.,Suzuki
"My neighbour bought this vehicle about a couple of months ago. The scooty looks good but there are many problems which are very heart breaking. Not even a week after the purchase, it started leaking oil. It takes a lot of time everyday to start either I had kept pressing starter or use kicker!",Suzuki
My odometer reads 8124.9 KM now in 7 months(40 KM daily average),Suzuki
My parents feel this model more comfortable than any other brands.,Suzuki
"My previous two wheeler was a bajaj 4s champion bike, I had to let it go since no spares were available.",Suzuki
"My recommendation is this scooter is best suited for people with minimum 5' 3"" height, young generations, likes speed, style conscious & the one who wants to own a scooter.",Suzuki
My relatives brought a old deign suzuki access 125 now it is three years old but now the scooty make much problems like silencer make so much noise it has given to many times for servicing but no use again and again a new problem is creating when ever it is given for servicing or repair it gets so much of cost to repair the design of the scooty is not much attractive like new designed suzuki acvess 125 the milage is also very less no comfort the road grip also not good I appeal to make a advanced scooty with affordable price hope you guys like this reveive if you like comment like and share thank you,Suzuki
My scooter running only 18000 km but this duration its half engine repaired two time. It spare part is so costly and not genuine parts  available easily.,Suzuki
My sincere and honest request to all of you is to go for Honda.,Suzuki
"My sister bought access 125 in 2015. It is the only vehicle which has killer look. It is not Soo comfortable as the handles are hard with stiff design. But it's a heavy duty scooter. It's pick up is excellent . It has small space . It's road grip is not so satisfactory but it's balance is good . But the main fault is that its braking system, even after several services it's brakes are not up to the Mark. I have met with so many minor accidents because of its braking system. But the excellent merit of this vehicle is its acceleration and pick up . I like its greyish metal body. Its very appealing and awesome. Its headlights and other lighting system are very good. Stillthe over all vehicle is okey not bad. The person who think #speed thrills#???? can buy this bull.",Suzuki
My sister is using this suzuki access since a long time.it is very poor quality and it's performance is so poor.,Suzuki
My sister purchase this scooty because suzuki is oldest company and its star performance.it's really comfortable.,Suzuki
My sister rides it too and she also loves the ride of it.it is easy to ride and these are the good things in it-,Suzuki
My sister's son got suzuki access 125 as gift 6 months before. scooter look like good and it is little higher than other scooters. I ride so many times for long trip. but sound of scooter is not good its having sound like auto rickshaw. and didn't get good balancing comparatively other scooters may it become fall down as a low gripping tire. and we both are went to service centre for telling these matter. they adjust the chain and socket and add little oil on it. that time sounds little reduce after 2 days sound came again. mileage reduces when sound coming from scooter. don't know what can I do. I dont have any more options still having sound. customer exicutives also cant do everything.,Suzuki

NOTE- The milage what your vehicle gives is how you would mantain it in the very first month of purchasing. In the first month plss dont exceed speed above 40 km/hr and should go for regular servicing this will ensure your vehicle for a grat milage.,Suzuki

"Negatives: Engine sound not at acceptable level while the scooter is accelarting, rear suspension should have been softer, head light is weak, seat is too hard to be comfortable for long drives.",Suzuki
Neutral sitting position of access 125 and seat comfort and not tired during long rides,Suzuki
"Never bothered about the looks as long as there's nothing pointlessly weird about the design. GC was never an issue, dunno why it should even be an issue for bikes. Overall, it's held up very well over these years and has aged WAYYYY more graciously than the Activa.",Suzuki
"Never buy access 125 beacuse of below given disadvantages dreaded heavy not for ladies starting problems even in summer hard suspension single sided handle lock after one year engine stops in between traffic, cant accelerate even normally poor mileage, approx 30-35 km/ltr high cost of maintenance and not even 1 week after I purchased access it started leak oil and it was taking 10 minutes everyday to start either I had keep pressing starter or use kicker for 10 minute. its not good for me. . sry and thanks for view my review",Suzuki

It includes good grip, mettalic cover body, good mileage and stylish looks. It can handle any type of roads without any discomfort while traveling. It is a BS4 vehicle with AHO(automatic headlight on) system as per government rule. It has lot of space to store things inside with a charging point and a small holder.

"New scooter battery gave out, I had to change battery within 1 year. Scooter has starting problem. Mechanic says some issue with compresser. Scooter can shut off anywhere. The starting problem is very irritating. Very bad workmanship by Suzuki. My personal opinion do not buy this. Go for activa Or Jupiter.",Suzuki

"Neways so after lots of review on mouthshut, I bought Access which I cant believe because I was going to buy either of Activa or Aviator but I dont know from where did I buy this one.",Suzuki
Next stop is TVS showroom. They have these option of Jupiter and Wego scooters. The staff in showroom was very co-operative and make sure the costumer is satisfied in all the help they can give. I took test drive for jupiter and the experience was very good as compare to active/aviator. Handling is far more better then honda scooters that I tried earlier. Average was pretty much same. For one moment I thought my search is complete and I should buy this. The problem arise with leg space which was not effective as I was expecting. Then I took test drive for Wego and the experience was not as good as with jupiter.  Pricing with loan is costing me cheap as compare to HONDA. Jupiter was almost final but I thought of testing other before making decision. Next stop was supose to be HERO or YAMAHA but it turned out to be SUZUKI,Suzuki
Nice I have give 1 month nice awsome nice beautiful bike I love this bike I like it amazing bike,Suzuki
Nice sound compared to same features scooty activa and facino. I feel little boost up when accelerating really feels good. nice pickup Bike's mileage was quite bad compared to other bikes. My bike giving me 40kmpl according to the quality of petrol. If it is good then giving up to 45kmpl if not only giving 40kmpl. Seat back space is small. all guards material plastic only. May easily breakable.Very good looking scooty ever I have known. Comes with new look and light weight also. Have a look at this.,Suzuki
No disc break or combi break Honda scooters come with combi break and I guess Aviator offers disc break.,Suzuki
No need to search more after coming here .its a very comfort vehicle. I have suzuki acces and it is working good till now. Its been 2 years I have bought and still it gives approx 38 average. It has good jumpers compare to others.nice in look and accesories.,Suzuki
No problems so far. Nice acceleration. Regular usage dont give any problems. Dont have problem cold start because I didnt face any such problem when compared to Activa 3G. Nice acceleration. Quick to zip around city traffic. Good controll. Neat balanced chassis. Preformance 9/10. Mileage 45 Kmpl on average.,Suzuki
No responsible person in that agency to do things properly and support customer,Suzuki
No special features It just comes with the basic options. It does not even have a side stand indicator that is present in scooty. But I like the opening of under seat box by just twisting the ignition key instead of inserting the key separately like in activa.,Suzuki
No starting problem - Even when I start the scooter after few days of being idle. I never used the choke till date.,Suzuki
"No starting problems as yet. however the electrical parts seem problematic, had to replace a bulb+ indicator switch and fix the rear brake electrical contacts.( Scooter not starting when that brake is pressed, brake light not coming on for that brake .)",Suzuki
Not a very powerful head lamp. We cannot see the road properly in darkness.,Suzuki
Not at all good for long ride the engine gets so hot and may lead to breakdown.,Suzuki
"Not certain if this is the principal audit of Suzuki Access in this stage. Prior I had composed on Honda Activa which has been sold in the wake of driving 48000 Kms in 5 years for an OK 24K. Ofcourse it was kept up in that design and put something aside for petrol and oil transform, I have brought about no cost… .shot verification dependability without a doubt! So now Suzuki get to has an extreme test in type of Honda Activa or rather the other way around. Honda Activa on the grounds that Kinetic Flyte represents no danger because of different reasons fundamentally absence of focus(they continue changing models of bicycles and bikes at regular intervals numerous a circumstances Korean and different brands at that), dependability and consumer loyalty, despite the fact that Flyte may offer some better goodies in bundle that might be of enthusiasm for young people! This won't be a point by point street test however an assessment of Suzuki get to post couple of Kilometers of test driving and some individual perception on bike.",Suzuki
Not good scooter in this price of 61000 am using this scooter since 1 years and I am not at all satisfied by the experience ! Fuel consumption is too high about35kp/l and I have to repair it every month. the placement of the air filter is too low so rain water easily enters the filter and the bike does not start ! There were also many problems related to battery and the kick gets stucked in the center stand ! Please guys do not buy this bike just because it can run fast ! Instead buy activa scooter.,Suzuki
Not ideal for long journeys at a stretch. will get a back pain.,Suzuki
"Not just a scooter its more than dat.comes with 125cc engine and lighter than privious model, frond disc with alloy and also front wheel is bigger in size. bigger seat and very comfotable and the cabinat inside the seat is much bigger and also availabe with charger point facilty and gives the milage of 64kmpl, beautiful parking light also available, also uper hook below handle to hang something and also A Ppouch to keep mobile while charging",Suzuki
Not only its increase the power and stability new access also work on sitting. Its new comfortable and long sitting I am getting a new experience of ridding.,Suzuki
"Not sure if this is the first review of Suzuki Access in this platform. Earlier I had written on Honda Activa which has been sold after driving 48000 Kms in 5 years for a decent 24K. Ofcourse it was maintained in that fashion and save for petrol and oil change, I have incurred no cost….bullet proof reliability indeed! So now Suzuki access has a tough challenge in form of Honda Activa or rather vice versa. Honda Activa because Kinetic Flyte poses no threat due to various reasons primarily lack of focus(they keep on changing models of bikes and scooters every 6 month many a times Korean and other brands at that), reliability and customer satisfaction, even though Flyte may offer some better tidbits in package that may be of interest for teenagers! This will not be a detailed road test but an evaluation of Suzuki access post few Kilometers of test driving and some personal observation on scooter.",Suzuki
Note: Usage is very less. My father uses it that too only to travel only between  factories and godowns which are located inside half a kilometer radius.,Suzuki

"Now I am using this without any trouble. If you are not bothered about no of service centres, milaage. Go ahead & purchase Suzuki Access!!",Suzuki
Now I want to tell you about its road grip its road grip is awesome that It really good working it did not slip on the road we applied the break it stop Awesomely its grip really use when you find a person on the road Suddenly it's really helped you to stop the bile its break is so smooth it is good bike I think so. The grip of the tyer really help in the rainy days there for the grip is awesome,Suzuki
Now a days diwali offer is going on so I would preffer to buy suzuki gixxer instead of access or we can also go for activa 3g its great,Suzuki
Now a days everyone wants sporty rugh looks with smooth handling .it's my personal opinion that access 125 gave light weighted mopad with perfect controlling .the access gave all that colour loks that we want it's rugh mud colours I love it .,Suzuki
"Now a new thing of occasional rear wheel jamming is occurring. sometimes you cannot move scooter forward or backward due to this jamming. once engine started, rear wheel starts moving. it gives a scary feeling that what will happen if the rear wheel suddenly jams when I am driving it at around 50kmph at the middle of road!",Suzuki
Now also I am pretty happy with the performance of the scooter. I am getting a mileage of around 50-55 in city+high way conditions.,Suzuki
Now as far as the body and design is concerned it looked good in the begining but later after using it for 2 months you will realise that the bike is very light and not good at all.,Suzuki
"Now comes to its looks and the performance, the new 2017 model gives a glimpse of vespa, you would agree if you watch it on road, the new model looks very much alike to vespa which gives it a plus one USP in looks.",Suzuki
"Now days the acces 125 is in form. The look is so much good. The access is available in different colors like blue, black, silver. Etc. I bought blue colour access. Also is having super mileage. Mileage is 40km",Suzuki
"Now doesn't it sound like ""monopoly"". There shall be some rule to allow customers to change oil by them self by keeping proof of oil change outside. But just by waiving warranty if we change outside is ridiculous.",Suzuki
Now for comfort this is very bad the seat is wide and after long distance we can't seat more in this bike.,Suzuki
"Now having crossed 3000Kms on my odo and with 2nd service done, my mileage is now between 43-45. Off late had some starting problems and some misfires which got reduced once I changed the bunk where I filled petrol. Any case complained with the service staff to have a look if some thing is wrong. After service not seen the problem yet. So far fully satisfied with the performance and power and mileage.",Suzuki
Now i'll tell you about Suzuki Access 125  which is 125cc scooter recently launched by Suzuki in india.,Suzuki
Now i'll tell you about Suzuki access bike 125 which is 125cc scooter recently launched by Suzuki in india.Its handle is quiet different for some people who go for access from activa or anyone else because its handle is little bit short in length but its grip is awesome and their is no issue in controlling the scooter because it is light in weight.It has long and wide seat which is very comfortable for long drives.You can trust on this scooter blindly because its a product under the name of suzuki and suzuki is well known for making their products with full consistency and hardwork which raises its bar for reliability.The looks of this is very different from any other scooter because it has a vintage scooter headlight and arrogant design which makes it very stylish.It gives a mileage of 40 to 45 Km per Litre under normal conditions.,Suzuki
Now iam sharing experience with my bike Suzuki access 125 I buoyed my bike years nice experience my bike blue color bike I like that color and I love my bike .Bike feature are good and quality products nice very driving my bike very convenience engine capacity is good good waiter bike 55 mailage bike serving 9 free witha taking money good job bike had any problem they repped immediately and nice cleaning and washing services also free now completed my all 9 services nice bike my brother also burned bike white one,Suzuki
"Now it was my turn to see worst service . To enter 11 lines in billing system which is automatic I it took around 45 Mins. I had experience even worst previously, this is reason my I haven’t done all my free services from Suzuki( Bhai Je auto)    I was standing there for 1 hour. Few things you should note….",Suzuki
"Now it was my turn to see worst service . To enter 11 lines in billing system which is automatic I it took around 45 Mins. I had experience even worst previously, this is reason my I haven’t done all my free services from Suzuki( Bhai Je auto) I was standing there for 1 hour.",Suzuki
Now its also have Mobile charger option its very convenient for mobile lovers those who want to keep their phone on all the time. Front pocket also use full for all. Disc brakes variant is excellent.,Suzuki
"Now its less than 10, 500 KMS and spark plug, holder, air intake hose, speedometer cable all has to be replaced. The clutch needs service every 45-60 days in normal Bangalore city driving!",Suzuki
"Now let me come to economy. The vehicle has given me 48 kmpl on my first ride, even before the first service. I expect it to go up to 60 kmpl after 2 or 3 services. The light focusing was not correct, I went to the showroom and they solved the problem in 2 minutes.",Suzuki
Now my question is what is the point collecting money on 27th dec 2010 so far what they have doing? And I come to know that immediately delivery extra 6000/- How come if I pay 6000/- extra I can get Vehicle with 10 Days?,Suzuki
Now my sister is planning for sale out the same and moving for activa because the activa is much better from this Suzuki Access,Suzuki
Now shall update the next mileage and experience figures once 5K is done after that shall put my long term report ie 1 year only. Hope this detailed review of mine help some one in deciding to buy this vehicle.,Suzuki
"Now that I took the vehicle and drove for more than a month, below are my views",Suzuki
Now the only thing I didnt like was the brake it is horrible as I have to tighten the brakes every week or so and the quality wasnt that good another thing is that spare body parts are hard to find.,Suzuki
Now this have many problems like skidding. And this self is not working currently so I am very unhappy. And this milage is pure. When buy this company said above 60kmpl but now this milage is below 40kmpl. So very pure bike. But this look and feel awesome. And performance wase you can buy this. Milage wise this is pure bike.,Suzuki
"Now to go for a new scooter of this category, I took sometime and judgement. Now, since I am used to riding such a two wheeler very much, I was looking for 1. Comfort, 2. Reliability, 3. Economy. For Comfort being the first choice, I had some options.",Suzuki
Now we come to its comfort so it was not that much comfortable rider is comfortable but the pillon can't sit that much comfortablly.,Suzuki
"Now, After 2 years, I cannot afford to sit back & relax(pun intended) as my lower back is aching if I go for a 15km continuous drive.",Suzuki
Nowadays there are different kind of scooters which are better than these Honda Activa and access but at my time there was only 3 option Honda Activa Suzuki Access 125 and pleasure,Suzuki
"OK we shell our Rs.1700+ for the so called accessories- every two wheeler company put up the mat, handle cover etc as complimentary( Honda gives it) these dealers are so figitive with every paise they try to grab from the customer.",Suzuki
"Of course I have waited for 2 months in baroda. But my waiting period is worth. No other scooter in this category is near to suzuki 125 access and black color has a superb look. I had experience of bajaj super, bajaj chetak and lastly of activa for last 20 years. But i still prefer the suzuki 125 access as best scooter of the decade.",Suzuki
"Of course the vendor provides two years maintenance free cum paid service, sandwiched in between, a clever ploy to retain the customer with them. Spare parts are not available any whether other than with the vendor who are hardly one or two in a metro like Chennai. The rim also does not withstand bump which are common in our Indian roads.",Suzuki
"Of late one can view spate of advertisment being beamed through channels on this Suzuki Access 125. We purchased it when it was introduced in the market.  It is since a year we have been using this vehicle. We were advised by our vendor to get front guard fixed to our scooter to avoid dent to the front portion. It fell down on the day it was fixed during ride. Subsequently we were advised by one of their mechanic that the guard will not withstand the front portion as body covering the front tyre is made up of plastic. The front plastic cover, in due course, also got crack and the vendor refused to change it though it was a manufacturing defect. The vehicle requires frequent refill of engine oil as otherwise the vehicle fails to run smoothly and some kind of rugged noise emanates from the engine.",Suzuki
Of the buyer I dont believed that a superb scooter and my scooter is a access and iam using  this bike access is good looking shine,Suzuki
On  4th Oct 2012 once again I argue with the service center manager as please give all the service details those your people done during these services done for my vehicle so I have to mail to Suzuki Co. fro wrest mileage. They told me that not able to give the details and once again told me to leave the vehicle for checkup which is serviced on 6th August 2012.,Suzuki
"On October 3, 2013, in collaboration with Bollywood superstar Salman Khan's Being Human foundation, Suzuki launched the special ‘Being Human’ edition of the Suzuki Access 125. The special edition is available only in Pear Mirage White colour and features ‘Apna Way of life’ logo. Other features in the Special Edition include beige leather seat cover, chrome grab rail and rear view mirrors. The special edition Access 125 is more expensive than the standard edition of Access 125.",Suzuki
"On Road price 52300+ 3000 for steel bumpers, (very effective and necessary)",Suzuki
"On going through the reviews, there are enough complaints regarding servicing and about the dealers.May be it is a universal phenomena. as far as ACCESS dealers are concerned. It seems that the Customer Service Department is quite ineffective and inefficient.Its high time the CSD has to go through the reviews if the company is genuinely interested in their customers.",Suzuki
"On paper, the figures don't seem much, but the 2016 Suzuki Access 125 impressed us every time you pin the throttle open. It's not lightning fast off the block, but the scooter's got enough grunt to give a sense of a strong, solid performer. Acceleration is smooth and linear, and we managed to hit a speedo-indicated top speed of just over 90kmph, and while it does that, there's no vibration or protest from the engine, even at high speeds. Even with a pillion on board ( a rather heavy one at that) , the Access 125 pulls without giving any sense of feeling stressed.",Suzuki
"On performance side this bikes with lighter weight gave it quick pickup and ease drive with or without a pillion rider. A 125 cc engine throws sufficient power which was missing in lower cc scooties like Activa 3G. For a taller guy with this scooty(more than 5.8"") you will not feels hazels cause your hands will be straiten and legs won't bend due to higher ground base. It results with less tiredness in long run.",Suzuki
On the first free service they took 3 days to service the vehicle and they had also caused a minor dent on mud guard which they did not accepted happened by them.,Suzuki
"On the first free service they took 3 days to service the vehicle and they had also caused a minor dent on mud guard which they did not accepted happened by them. When asked about the dent on mud guard, the supervisor blamed that it was already there before the vehicle given for service and misbehaved. Mileage is also very poor, very uneconomical.",Suzuki
"On the flyover the bike head is just up even if it is loaded with weight of more than 150Kg, many times I travelled with 150 Kg on it and never noticed any slow moving action of it on flyover. Even if big vehicle passes the vehicle never vibrates to its own way. The engine does not make too much noise but when you switch off then you can hear a “tick” sound from engine.",Suzuki
"On the move, the shed weight shows through in the way that the Access feels lighter on its feet while the larger front wheel offers more confidence with a taller, more upright stance. The new Access is nimbler than its forerunner for sure but surprisingly changes characteristics in a few areas where the latter excelled. The added torque and lesser weight makes for brisk starts off-the-line but beyond 65kmph, power delivery softens in the mid-range and tapers off towards the top-end of the rev-range. This is quite unlike the zippy, sprightly performance of the older scooter.",Suzuki
On the other hand one more thing which I didnot like was that its pickup.which is also.baad one.,Suzuki
On the other side the poor side of access is only its average per litre but it can be overcome by maintainance easily.,Suzuki
"On the way from Vespa showroom I went to Suzuki showroom and test drove the Access 125, it was the same little impressive scoot, that I liked few months back. Enquires about the Disc and alloy version and got a positive reaponse. It was good that there was no booking process involved, but I was told there were only two colors available with them in Access disc variant, White and Blue. Having seen both the colors I chose blue. On the D day, I just called the SA in the morning and told him that I will take delivery of the Blue Access 125 Disc brake variant with just three accessories(Ladies foot rest, indicator buzzer and mobile charger provision), he was happy to oblige. Went there in the evening, made the payment and there it was, my Blue bird.",Suzuki
On the whole its a reliable urban commuting vehicle offering great value for money at 44000/- onroad pune and .,Suzuki
"Once got a glance of Access while passing through Suzuki Sub-dealership in the town. Entered into the show room & took a test drive. Simply floored........., never thought scooter driving can so much of fun. The pick up was mind blowing & the smothness was something to be envied. That moment decided to buy one scooter from this segment & real research started after that. Took test ride of Honda Aviator- Smooth, pick up not awsome as Access ; Flyte- Pick up not good as access, smooth, ground clearance was pathetic- grazed less than normal height bumpers with a pillion rider regularly ; pleasure- girlish look, too small storage space , lack of telescopic front suspension ; New Honda Activa- did not get chance to test drive as the model was out of stock, but probably may not have considered due to not so encouraging review on MS , lack of telescopic front suspension.",Suzuki
"Once out of craze, I had been to my relatives place 30 km away with my family with the scooter . We were four ( daughter- 11 yrs old- wt 45 kg., son- 5 yrs old-16kg, myself- 70 kg, wife-52 kg). The journey was not comfortable. While coming back, my daughter refused to return with us. But still with rest three of us ( son standing in front) , the journey was not as comfortable as expected by me , though the level of comfort improved as compared to our out -ward journey.",Suzuki
Once the bike will get repair alternatively we have to go to the mechanic shop.so my friends be careful when are buying a bike before buying know about it.,Suzuki
"Once the vehicle starts noise of it goes a bit wild but when the vehicle reaches 40Km mark, absolutely there would be no sound from the engine would be heard. Mileage is between 48 to 50. But I advise that let the mind be prefixed to a mileage of 45Km's per liter. On the whole I would suggest inspiring purchasers to go ahead with this vehicle wherein you will not repent for the money you spent. Thanks for spending your time, Good Luck. S N Murthy",Suzuki
"Once we ride this scooter, the power attracts us and ask us to buy it.I planned to buy a 110cc scooter but during the test drive it just conquered my heart.",Suzuki
Once you buy a scooter from them they do not care/Respond to your queries. At a speed of 40 it runs as if 20 speed. Please do not buy this vehicle.,Suzuki
"Once your vehicle has arrived after 4 months - you are called to pay the balance, at this time they tell you **to pay the complete balance.",Suzuki
"One Of The Best Scooter For Every Indiviual. Excellent Looks. It Gives Mileage Upto 59 kmpl. Price 59000( INR) . I Am Using This Bike For About 15 days. Decent Scooter. Engine Is Not So Noisy At High Speed. Cool Colours: White, Glass Sparkle Red, Metallic Fibroin Grey, Metalic Sonic Silver, Peral Mirage White.",Suzuki
"One advantage though is that its forks are telescopic bike like! Rear suspension and comfort is excellent while the firmness of the cushion is also very good. Nothing much to differentiate from Activa here. Access comes with rear foot pegs, side stands, floor mat, mirrors and without stepney. The body is anti-rust due to it being non-metallic but inspite of this it was heavier(see above) isn’t it? If you forget its an 125 cc engine so the engine weight comes into play! The fit and finish was damn good where both Activa as well as Access scores here…nothing to differentiate. Head lights of Access is much superior with good focus and increased power as compared to Activa though I would have loved to evaluate this in night condition instead of day. Vibration was almost nil during the short ride. Before I forget…Access has a shutter mechanism for its key hole.",Suzuki
"One aspect that could be improved is the availability of additional color options. While the existing color choices are decent, a wider range of options would allow riders to personalize their scooter according to their preferences.",Suzuki
"One bad about this Suzuki access is not able to find any mechanic who can repair it correctly. Only authorised Suzuki persons could only repair it well. And also there is no availability of spare part  in the market, one has to go to showroom for buying the spare parts. No other choice.",Suzuki
One biggest thing it loses against Honda is that Indians still prefer Honda as honda being a promising and their trust on honda.,Suzuki
One cannot use kicker if the center stand is removed. but in Honda Activa this is not so like this.,Suzuki
One day I going this scooty my office I saw on highway good contoral and good picup.good milage and good contoral market.,Suzuki
"One favorable position however is that its forks are adjustable bicycle like! Raise suspension and solace is great while the immovability of the pad is likewise great. Not a lot to separate from Activa here. Get to accompanies raise foot pegs, side stands, floor tangle, mirrors and without stepney. The body is against rust because of it being non-metallic however inspite of this it was heavier(see above) would it say it isn't? In the event that you overlook its a 125 cc motor so the motor weight becomes possibly the most important factor! The fit and complete was damn great where both Activa and in addition Access scores here… nothing to separate. Head lights of Access is much unrivaled with great concentration and expanded power when contrasted with Activa however I would have wanted to assess this in night condition rather than day. Vibration was practically nil amid the short ride. Before it slips my mind… Access has a shade system for its key opening.",Suzuki
One girl executive is their so promisingly she talks but does nothing we booked the vehicle and payed full cash and got the vehicle after 7 days. the worst place,Suzuki
"One guy looked at my Access 125 and said ""I usually don't like Victory bikes but your Access is one of the best looking bikes of any brand I've ever seen.""",Suzuki
"One look and it's apparent that the all-new Suzuki Access 125 won't win any beauty contests, and it's not likely to turn too many heads on the street as well. But one thing is certain, the all-new Access 125 looks big, and quite handsome. It's cut out in gracious lines rather than being fashionably hip and doesn't make a loud, brash statement.",Suzuki
One more draw back is there is no external fuel filling and the main thing is mileage and reliability of the bike.,Suzuki
One more drawback is there is no external fuel filling and the main thing is mileage and reliability of the bike.,Suzuki
One more in access silencer elevation is too worst.(technically it is good) but looks are bad.Any howw thanks to all the reviews on Access which makes my mind towards Access,Suzuki
"One more intresting fact is that it should give more mileage as and when compared to activa's old v-matic engine at least theoretically it should give 8 to 10 km more then activa because of its cvt engine(if you are wondering what is CVT? and its benefits then go to wikipedia.com and learn by yourself.)  Some important tips for improved mileage(1)kick start in morning(2) dont overthrottle (3)keep the vehicle weight to minimium i.e More weight=require more power=more fuel=less mileage.(4)Never ever turn off your engine while still in motion, i.e to save fuel etc . by doing so you will harm your vehicles catalytic converter.(5) dont use break unnecessarily",Suzuki
"One more thing I notices is, it relatively difficult to control the scooter in the bumper to bumper traffic and during the short turn. The engine tyres to push ahead the vehicle even if you slightly raise it, so need to be careful.",Suzuki
"One must hook the scooter on main stand, if one wants to kich start it, where as other popular model like scooty (which my daughter drove for 2-3 years) could be kick start while on side stand itself. More over the kich shall be covered with rubber grip to avoide sliping while kicking, they made it grooved but it does not work much.",Suzuki
One of my all time favourites vehicles.i actually have bought this in the year 2010 and I am still using it. Being 7 years of usage it never troubled me I any way. It 10 free company services are provided at time of purchase and the service will also be good. It is highly comfortable and reliable. It is also budget friendly and worth the buy,Suzuki
One of my friend have this bike in white colour and he always goes clge with access 125 its is good bike and gaves good milenge and also looks great and I like it,Suzuki
"One of my friend he buyed suzuki access 125 last he buyed this one for around 68, 000 with additional accesories this good price for 125 cc bikeEngine performance and fuel performance-engine for this bike is realy smooth and this bike is giving millage of 50 to 55 km per liter.",Suzuki
One of my friends has Access and so before buying it I Took a drive on it. I liked it and decided to buy it. Access has unique look and design with much leg space in front with small box given in front to keep things.,Suzuki
"One of the WORST Suzuki showrooms in Bangalore. Abolutely PATHETIC service. After our visit in 3-4 showrooms in Bangalore, we went ahead with Avanish because of their price. But after booking, first they increased the Price of the vehicle. They make us travel all the way to showroom to hear this. It is very DISAPPOINTING! Secondly, they promise dates they can never. They said 2 days but finally after some 20 calls from our side they delivered after 1 week. Very LETHARGIC and SLOW agents who have absolutely no sense of Responsibility. They don't deserve to serve any customer like this. Now, after promising the registration and number plate, it's been almost a month and we haven't got any number plate. Moreover the out complaints about brake and noises from the vehicle were completely IGNORED by the sales and service people. I hope somebody from suzuki looks into this because their brand is certainly going down the drains if people like these keep serving.",Suzuki
One of the bad looking scooter I have ever seen. Mileage may be good but in sense of look it's the worst. Its acceleration is too hard and also not so good like other scooter its road grip is also Bad it's body is not so balanced. Its a heavy scootwr,Suzuki
"One of the best gearless drive vehicle with MILEAGE of 50kmpl on average, high comfort zone is achieved due to width of seat and space provided for foot rest and easy to keep heavy baggage and material for personal transportation purpose and has a good APPEAL. ROAD GRIP is very high,chance of skid is minimum at average speed of 50Km/Hr on dry but on wet days speed should be minimised . PICK UP is very high can compete with sports bike like PULSAR 150 BUT regular servicing is required for better service and life of vehicle. It is a RELIABLE product of suzuki and can be trusted for safe journey and long life.",Suzuki
One of the best scooty in 125 cc segment. The mileage of the vehicle is about to be 52kmpl. Riding experience is fabulous. Maintenance is very less.Change filter and spark plugs after every 7000 km. To get better mileage. And maintain tyre pressure 30 psi front and 40 psi rear. It is first scooty I purchased and satisfied with performance,Suzuki
One of the better scooties.i have had one for 3 years in a hillstaton and it's power hasn't decreased a bit.milage is pretty good I can travel like 55km for just hundered rupees gas.looks are not pretty bad either.it has huge under seat space it also dosen't require a whole lot of maintianance if I were to rate between activa and access I would go for access.,Suzuki
One of the main reasons I booked this is the front shock absorbers. Also the clicking sound of the side stands is good and the same stands out. The Storage capacity seems to be good and spacious too.,Suzuki
"One of the standout features of the Access 125 is its design. Suzuki has done a great job of blending modern aesthetics with a classic scooter silhouette. The sharp lines and sleek bodywork give it a contemporary look, while the chrome accents add a touch of elegance. The overall design is appealing and eye-catching, making the Access 125 a scooter that turns heads on the road.",Suzuki
"One of the things I like most about this scooter is its performance. The engine is powerful and responsive, allowing me to zip through city traffic easily. It accelerates smoothly, and the ride quality is comfortable, even on bumpy roads. The scooter feels stable and balanced while riding at higher speeds.",Suzuki
"One personal suggestion, go for white.  It doesn't fade away with time. Black looks good but it has to be maintained.",Suzuki
"One surprising this is that I went for the remaining accessories that they promised, and they got a front grill which covers that front lights were shaped very awkwardly. Except the manager nobody is interested to respond properly there... any some how I could manage to remove them and said to get the old good model of the grill.",Suzuki
"One thing is fine with this bike i.e the comfort level while travelling even in odd roads, it is able to give you a proper grip in such conditions.",Suzuki
"One thing is that I had done in the first service, adjustment of dim light to down as you can not get the lights clearly when travelling in night. The horn is ok to extend of requirement and you can realize it only when you don’t wear helmet. The bike has got very big space below to seat where I can keep my big helmet (not all helmets can be fitted to it you need to check before you go for purchase of helmet). The bike has got attractive look where you can notice some people’s eyes on it when you take for ride. The bike looks so trendy and athletic that you feel that this bike is made for all family peoples.",Suzuki
"One thing is very disturbing in this bike is that the whole body of bike is of fiber (plastics) and small touch of any other bike  or road or any other things will make scratch to it for permanent and you can not remove it or paint it like active Honda has option of painting. So this bike is very delicious so you need to take special care when travelling in slow moving traffic of heavy signals. This bike is not dust proof bike and within one day it will get very dirty although if it is cleaned pervious day. I also had problem with kick-start but it was due to new engine in the beginning and now with one kick it gets start. I thought horn is not good enough but noticed its effect only when tried without helmet and for some extend it is ok. It has all other futures like chrome plate, theft device, unique tail lights and body shape.",Suzuki
"One thing that could be improved is the suspension. While it handles most bumps and potholes well, I sometimes feel a bit of jolt on rough surfaces. A slightly softer suspension would make the ride even smoother.",Suzuki
"One thing we should be aware of that the steel guards does not fit properly on the front mudguard, mine fell down on the second day itself while I was driving this is dangerous, I got this fitted with the help of screws and nut-bolds insides the mudguard at home only. After that there hasn’t been any problem with that.",Suzuki
"One time when I was on my Access and I was stopped at a light, a young 20's girl stopped in the cross walk and said, ""That's the most beautiful bike I have ever seen.""",Suzuki
Ones I m driving this I fell good because my gal was jus behind me I know u al gay konw what itmean driving long and long wid the love one woooooo thats the only reason why I love sooo much,Suzuki
Only around 200 ml of oil goes into the final gear of the transmission located above the rear wheel. Failure to change this will result in wheel lock up which could be fatal.,Suzuki
Only frustrating thing is long waiting time for getting the vehicle in hand after booking the vehicle(2-4 months depending on the dealer).,Suzuki
Only glich is initial milege( 37 kmpl for a run of 104 kms) but hope will improve. Though feel handling a little bit tricky on Pune's monsoon ravaged roads but could be due to the fact that I am more used to driving car. Start & Pick up are like a breeze. vehicle is powerful & it shows. You can feel the power the moment the signal turns green( & people green wth envy) Though I find centre stand a bit heavy to operate. A how to in this regard answer from any body is welcome. Breaks ae reasonably good.,Suzuki
"Only handling of this scooter can be said as good, because of its small height and light handle weight which makes it easy to handle",Suzuki
"Only issue is with Mileage of the bike, but I believe it will be taken care in the next versions of the bike.",Suzuki
Only mileage is little bit low otherwise it is a goog choise but I think activa is more good than access bacause of its mileage and other thinks are mostly same in both,Suzuki
"Only problem I have is when my vehicle is due for service. I have to travel atleast 20 kms and wait for 4-5 hrs till my vehicle is returned back. In Pune there are only 3 service stations, which are heavily loaded with vehicles to be serviced. Also I feel that fuel efficiency could have been better if they had used MPFI instead of caburettor.",Suzuki
"Other Accessories includes: Steel Basket(210), Foot mat(100), stepney cover(25), Body cover - TEXO(280), Helmet Lock(200), Access windscreen(350).etc.!",Suzuki
Other scooter are very better than this . it does not give good average . I AM UNABLE TO START MY ACCESS BY BUTTON OR KICK. I HAVE CALLED IN SHIV AUTORIDERS BUT NOBODY HAS LIFTED MY PHONE. NEXT DAY THEY HAVE DONE SERVICING & MY ACCESS STARTED. AGAIN AT 7 th PAID SERVICE I TOLD THEM ABOUT BATTERY PROBLEM BUT THEY TOLD ME TO REPLACE THE SAME BY PAYING MONEY.,Suzuki
Other these I found this vehicle is really good... Suzuki has to fix the above to make the access 100%.,Suzuki
Other users pls share ur reviews based on these parameters or comment on what you people have experienced.,Suzuki
Other vhiekes.in the.market various.calours.avilable .for different,Suzuki
Others will come in your way. Head light was pointing to sky as other wrote but can be adjusted by adjusting the screw below the head light set outside which is written in the manual. Here is the problem. When you adjust the headlight the gap between the headlight body and the frame widens and you will feel the the resistance at high speed due to air rushing through that gap. Luggage space is very less and helmet space is just enough. Dust will easily enter the luggage space may be due to seat not fitting air tight. Silencer is bit outwards and easy chance to get hit from backside.,Suzuki
"Our first taste of the new Suzuki was in the city. The first pleasant realisation was that the two chunky testers on board had clear air between them. Clearly, the new longer seat is long enough. Secondly, despite the considerable payload that we presented, the Access was handling the rigours of the city without letting out so much so as a whimper. Even as the engine was put under high loads, it remained smooth and quiet. At lower speeds, throttle response is prompt, and it pulled in a linear manner even as speeds climbed.",Suzuki
Over all a nicely packaged vehicle with very less advertisement .. Shall update more on the mileage front and other experiences later...,Suzuki
Over all its a very good product of Suzuki and Suzuki can become popular with this again.,Suzuki
"Over all performance is good even ladies can easily ride this bike, it’s also a family bike.",Suzuki
Over heating due to other reasons(Heating problem was prominent right from the start),Suzuki
"Over taking is easy task on this vehicle, but I am very satisfied with the braking. A front disc brake could have given a great confidence to the scooter.",Suzuki
"Overall I am satisfied customer, request  you to go and buy… enjoy ride?",Suzuki
Overall I like the model and driving comfort so thumps up for Suzuki Access!,Suzuki
Overall I rate it 2/5. I feel they need to improve their engine. Moreover tyres don't have grip,Suzuki
Overall I would not suggest this vehicle as it is not value for money.,Suzuki
"Overall access is very very cool scooter in comparison with all the other scooters and its best compatiter Activa 125, thank you.",Suzuki
Overall conclusion after 1 year demands too much maintenance this bike.so Please aware before purchase.,Suzuki
Overall does pretty good bike. Mileage of bike is good insted of activa 125 however a very good bike compression of others.i am using this over than 4month the price of this bike is also good. Engine capacity and specifications and milage is also good. So Suzuki access is good scooty for scooty lover.,Suzuki
Overall experience of my bike Suzuki Access 125 is good enough however there are some flaws / scope for improvement.,Suzuki
Overall great product by bad servicing .(By MRP Dombivali-Mumbai ) .,Suzuki
Overall its good for women...but DEFINETLY NOT FIT FOR MEN...take it for men of any age n ul regret it...unless ur thin or small than average male size..long riding can lead to back pain.........not fit for riding on bumpy roads or roads with pot holes..as us feel every jump hit ur spine hard..,Suzuki
Overall product looks good and test drive was good but in Bangalore its very costly . ex showroom 56k and on road looks 74 .Showroom taking extra 3k for some handling charges and 5k for acceerories .,Suzuki
Overall suzuki engines are not much good in performance. Don't go for suzuki vehicles,Suzuki
Overall the new Access 125 is a vehicle with great style and powerful performance bundled with class features. It is meant for everyone who loves to ride.,Suzuki
Overall the new access looks really fresh and diffferent and I personally love the blue color access.I feel the commuters have an option of buying a new design scooter now than the same old activa design scooters.,Suzuki
"Overall the product is good, however there seems to be a issue with their speedometer. I have purchased vehicle in 2018 and since then the speedometer has failed 4 times. Thrice the cable has been replaced and once the speedometer assembly.",Suzuki
Overall this bike is not good .now my sister has sale this bike. I will not recommend to buy this bike.thanks,Suzuki
Overall this scooter is good.and can be easily compete with other scooters in its segment.,Suzuki

Overall verdict its gud scooter but with some serious issues must be resolved,Suzuki
"Overall, I am really satisfied with my Suzuki Access 125. It offers a perfect balance of style, performance, and comfort. Whether you're a daily commuter or someone who enjoys occasional rides, this scooter is worth considering. It's reliable, fuel-efficient, and a joy to ride.",Suzuki

With its reliable engineering, fuel efficiency, and attractive design, the Access 125 stands as a strong contender in the scooter market.",Suzuki
"Overall, there's little to complain about the all-new Access 125. Sure, there's nothing much to go ga-ga about the design, but it's a handsome scooter, with understated, but smart looks and that itself will find appeal among a lot of consumers looking for a strong and stable family scooter.",Suzuki
Overall: A decent scooter for a family but not a trendsetter.,Suzuki
"P-riders foot rest - If you carry a male, definitely there is an issue. This troubles more when you are in lot of traffic and have to stop and go... when main rider have to do this the foot of the back rider hits your legs.. .which hurts a lot... Suzuki has fix this.",Suzuki
Paint quality of access 125 is good something which made different from other brand,Suzuki

Peoplpi.d suggest.go for.a black.one t know the actual.product.design and,Suzuki
"Per my experience, Suzuki engines are not less reliable than Honda or Yamaha. I picked this scooty after huge research and analysis. I found it quite reliable on hardware side. The tires are of CEAT which are also quite good and have nice threads.",Suzuki
Perfomance iam very much convinced 125 cc what pick up thats simply awesome.engine inception is low compare to older version thats imptoved alot.intial pick is nice.ride is very good.handling road grip .balancing is good.hmmm coming to braking iam not ok as its skids alot thats too rear wheel but thats on high speeds.these scooters not meant for higher spèeeds.better to maintain average speed of 50 kms will best drive experience.hmmm maximum speed I tried upto 90 kms on free roads.alloy wheels with tubeless tyres discbrakes driving is great.overall driving performance is good for me.,Suzuki
"Performance and engine looks good as per now, may be time will tell as HOnda reliability no body can beat.",Suzuki
Performance wise its ok it gives good mileage and the disk break works perfectly. The main thing I like about it that its pretty spacious at back one can sit very comfortably . But again activa perform way better than suzuki and its price is also cheaper than suzuki.,Suzuki
"Performance-  its so relaxed and stress free to drive assess in the traffic . ride quality in traffic is premium and is of course fun, we feel so silky and confident while over taking other vehicles . access is peppy and it regains its speed effortlessly while the sudden stops in traffic pickup has never declined when riding with a pillion . Access gains its smoothness and takes no time to reach 60kmph . access is so smooth and confident up to 75kmph but whenever I cross 75kmph and trying to touch its top speed the scooter feels little les confident but frankly no vibrations. so I always used to ride under safe mark . Anyhow 70kmph is good enough for scooters.",Suzuki
Performance- Access 125 performs snappy. It is quickest scooter in its class. It goes 0-60 kmph in 7 seconds.,Suzuki
Performance---125 cc engine is really powerful and great . One can comfortably cruise at 60km speed with no rattling or vibrations .throttle responds very well and there is immediate power delivery if you accelerate hard.the engine struggles a little bit in double riding which is negligible.,Suzuki
Performance: - The scooty is quite good in performance and fully justify its price with great pickup and speed and the latest version comes with disc brake which is an added advantage,Suzuki
"Performance: Good or very good, can clock upto 85 km/hr without any extra vibes and noises, pick up is slightly better than Activa(no way near to Vespa though). Thanks to the lighter body and 125cc engine. Makes citi drive a pleasure with ease.",Suzuki
Performance;- We can ride the Access upto 90 kmhr without any extra vibrations or noise. Makes Access drive easy with pleasure.,Suzuki
"Pick access. Fresh new design and more economy, power and an affordable price tag. These should be good enough To be convinced. Take a look at suzuki access",Suzuki
Pick up of skooty is great. Im from.himachal and it is good for even hilly areas its powerful.so its not a problem even is can pull two guys in hilly areas this is the best part .even not only for girls but for guys too.,Suzuki
"Pick-up/ start-up: Superb, no sluggish starts in morning, no need to kick start at all. (using Amaron battery ... removed exide battery which is very bad)",Suzuki
"Pickup - The initial pickup is not at all good. However, the speed is good.",Suzuki
"Pickup is good, so is the average mileage, 35-40 in city roads.",Suzuki
Pirelli SL26 Tires become slippery like MRF during the summer heat on hot black tarmac roads. This may have something to do with the bitumen melting and forming a slippery layer on the surface. Your vehicle may skid. Still a lot better than stock tires. Still superb on bad roads and concrete.,Suzuki
Please do not buy this scooter and do check what other user that really has it says.,Suzuki
"Please don't buy this vehicle, heavy weight, low mileage, service center is less. Only few dealers are there. Even if we tell our problem during service also they will not attend if we go and ask there is no proper person to attend.moreover when you are driving the vehicle at high speed.",Suzuki
"Please don't buy this, it has faulty engine design, after 18000 kms, engine gets spoils and showroom charging 140000 to repair, that too it is not guarantee to regain its condition. Better go for Honda, and also break system is not good.",Suzuki
Please don't go for this vehicle instead buy a Bicycle wherein you guys feel thousand times happier.,Suzuki
Please don't purchase this.  I will case for this to consumer court.,Suzuki
Please don't take this personally; this is for your own safety. Read below.,Suzuki
"Please guide me what to do for solving this low mileage problem. Can I go for Consumer Court. Any legal expert if read this message  please guide me. When you apply sudden break even at very low speed, the back wheel is skidded like ride on oil surface.  Against  all spite of this problem  vehicle  is very good  comfort and road grip.",Suzuki

Powerful engine of this bike can be able to perform well. I have two years experiences with this super bike. It gives me a charming personality in my friends and impressive in girls.I highly recommended it to you experience this at least for once . All I want to say that take a look on this bike awesome mileage and attractive look it has.,Suzuki
"Powering the Suzuki Access 125 is a 125cc single-cylinder engine which delivers 8.6bhp and 10.2Nm of torque, through a CVT transmission. This engine comes armed with the company's proprietary Suzuki Eco Performance(SEP) technology, which improves the efficiency without compromising on the performance.",Suzuki
"Price - Given the poor resale value, Suzuki should keep the price of this scooter little lesser",Suzuki
Price - The resale price of Suzuki Access 125 cc bike is much lower as compared to similar bikes in the same segment,Suzuki
Price could be about 53 thousands and is low price for this bike,Suzuki
"Price of Suziki Access is higher by Rs 5000. Both vehicle can be driven by Men and Women.  Height of both vehicles is same.For Activa, choke was necessary to start the vehicle first time during the day. For Suzuki Access, that is not the case. Not sure if they have removed this problem in newer version of Activa. This issue is very minor in nature.",Suzuki
Pricing part yaaa its costly(53 k in HYD). But I feel value for money.But I am more concerned with its body make(as its is bibre finished rather than metal). Luckily I got 2010 model with in 3 days (its full cash purchase). Dealer is ok but no technical knowledge. Sales guys are not good.Fine I took grey colour.,Suzuki
"Problem wise, both vehicles gave some issues which are minor in nature. In Activa, noise starting coming up 2-3 times which was resolved after servicing each time. For Suzuki, it was stopping midway and the same was resolved after first servicing.",Suzuki
"Problems encountered so far: When engine is switched off , it produces a krik sound just before going off , front suspension produces an undesirable sound on rough roads, some times a peculiar sound is produced from rear wheel that increases with speed- the mechanic says it is due to gravels entering into tyre's grip, which I do not believe. All these problems are from day one. Before two days anathor problem has cropped up- while accelarating from slow speed, peculiar sound is produced some where from rear for a moment & vanishes afterwards. I belive, these are all minor problems & will be taken care of in first service.",Suzuki
Problems till now: Air pipe disconnected twice(on its own); once this happens the bike would not start(unless you kick-start for at least 25-30 times).,Suzuki
Producing a whooping 8.60 BHP(Brake horsepower). and another thing to notice in 125 access is its xtp(xtra torque performance) that means it has sufficient torque to to take you from standstill to 60kmph or 0 to 60kmph in 5.6 seconds. so I will definitely recommand this scooter for everyone with thirst for speed and power.,Suzuki
"Product is fine for me. But the agency(Aryan Suzuki KR Puram) is very very bad in arranging customer needs like registration, insurance etc.",Suzuki
"Pros -  Good Pickup, Easy to handle, Smooth ride, Good Storage facility",Suzuki
"Pros: I bought Suzuki Access 125 as honda Activa had a long waiting period.I took a test drive on Access, found it very stable with good pickup with enough power.I am using it for last three years without any problem.I didn't even take the last 2 free services.I have changed engine oil in local garage.It colour is not faded.No parts were required to be change.I am satisfied customer. Cons: No Spare Wheel.",Suzuki
Puncture: You can fix a flat yourself within just 2 minutes with a tubeless tire puncture repair kit.,Suzuki

"Purchased Six months back Black Suzuki Access 125 after 25 days of booking I got delivery of the scooter from Mahavir Marg Suzuki, Jalandhar Punjab. First of all dealing of dealer is very good as compared to Honda dealers as they never hear to customers as of Activa.",Suzuki
Purchased a Access 125 a week ago. I earlier used the Activa. The Access is really good non geared vehicle and certainly better than the Activa.  I had used the Activa for 16 months and was fed up with it.,Suzuki

"Quality of spare parts is very good and need not to change very often though there is a problem of unavailability of service station. Luckily we a footpath mechanic who solve our common servicing. In the total tenure I have only changed 1 pc tapid valve and the gaskit which cost Rs 290/-, but as I purchased the spares from Kolkata and brought it through courier so the cost became Rs. 350/-.",Suzuki

"Quality: Starting from paint quality, plastics used, electronic parts, switches, everything is good, no parts replaced so far and few slip's here and there did not break any of it's body part or paint's(though we have steel guards), however there is a lot of rusting in silencer(not noticed in my sis's Activa after 7 years) which could also be coz of salty moisture in Chennai. I love the key hole closing mechanism which is absent in few other scooters.",Suzuki
"Quality;- Starting from body building, paint quality, electronic parts, switches and plastic things everything is so good. Body builded with steel tube.",Suzuki
Realability is good sit compressor is very good and space is so good its has a long sit than any of the another bike this is very comfortable to sit and three people can sit easily with this,Suzuki
Really Suzuki is really very nice when compared to honda activa.,Suzuki
Really it is irritating that I have booked the bike 3 months ago and havent received the bike yet and dealer offers the bike which is black in colour and I desperately wanted white isn't the company should fulfill customer needs than dictating the terms to customer and if this the case the company would go for a toss and first of all the suzuki brand is surviving oly because of access and I am waiting eagerly for hero maestro and for sure I will get it as soon as it is launched and please someone let me know abt its mileage and more over hero is an indian company where we can rely on it more than an foreign brand who is trying to dictate terms and more over the dealer is asking for 5 k more than the showroom price and they r saying its the company thats demanding the cost where I will get a bill.definately I will go for hero maestro than the company that is charging me 20% more than the actual price and the dealer I am referring is Aryan motors domlur bangalore hope so company guys look into this issue before its time for them to close.,Suzuki
"Really nice vehicle good mileage, with proper maintenance and care it can run for long",Suzuki

Received average of 55 km/l on Shell Extra Miles Petrol(the more expensive offering from shell).,Suzuki
Recently my friend took new access 125. It's really comfortable. A best city ride gearless bike. Handling and control is good. It's pretty smooth compared to old version. The new look is not that good as that of the old Access 125. Vehicle should be maintained time to time service and it's life span is better. The disc brake is a good addition to the bike. The overall bike is good and price is also quiet better as we are getting 125cc vehicle.,Suzuki
Recently that is 3 years back I bought a Suzuki Access 125 that is during diwali festival.,Suzuki
"Recently when I gave my access for second free service they said that engine & gear oil to be changed. I countered & said in the service book its mentioned that gear oil to be changed at 7100 kms, on which the person incharge said we normally get it done during second service ( which is at 3100 kms). I said what if i replace the oil by myself as your oil is costlier. Then the incharge said that i will not be liable for warranty if you change outside.",Suzuki
"Red colour, this is my first bike. In the beginning I was driving as per the company standards later I took it to the hosur main road till krishna giri with max speed of 50 kmph, later on through banergatta - anekal-Tamil Nadu villages.",Suzuki
"Regarding Braking, in the past 2 services I had to ask the service guys to tighten the rear brakes as I use them more. Its much more effective if you use the front & rear brakes together. And I never had a chance of not stopping the scooter when I desired to.",Suzuki
Regular service will keep the average & pickup good. No problems so far. Good to go for Access125.,Suzuki

Road grip, this bike has a very nice road grip even on wet road conditons. It is a amazing thing about it. Appeal, it has a nice beautiful looks and very well finished fibre body with attractive colours. One more drawback is there is no external fuel filling and the main thing is mileage and reliability of the bike.",Suzuki
"Reliability, the scooter suddenly stops in the middle of the road. Because of air filter and I have to raplace my airfilter.",Suzuki
"Reliability- As you all know suzuki is one of the leading company, so surely you can rely on this company as they know the values of the customers.",Suzuki
Reliability- it was the king that it has a good response in pickup the bike suddenly.,Suzuki
Reliability-It is a brand which is quite reliable and can go for 15 plus years.,Suzuki
Reliability: - its a bit delicate as madenup of fibre so needs to be maintained well.,Suzuki
Reliability: - scooty is quite reliable and good in performance I am driving it from past 8 months but did not notice any thing adverse in it,Suzuki
"Reliability: Average since the bike gives repeated starting trouble and slow speed stop's(even after carb clean up, spark plug & jet replacement) exists after crossing 15, 000 kmpl. Though I have serviced it regularly I am not very confident in terms of reliability after 1000 kmpl after oil service.Though it appears a minor problem when it is driven by ladies it's a major concern. Front fork noise is noticed even after fork over haul at 13000 kms.",Suzuki
"Reliability: From last 8 months I am using this bike, and I did not face any problem so far, as suzuki used quality products. It has very good self start, even on winters in one click I am able to start this bike.",Suzuki

Reliability: Suzuki provides 5 years engine warranty so there is nothing to worry about it. Ride as you like.,Suzuki
"Reliabilty: - Now it been 4 years that the access I had which I sold last year is working fine but is has become so what noisy as the parts have become loose. So would say, in city 2 years works very neatly and after that some problems starts to occur.",Suzuki
Reliable engine - No maintenance expenses other than periodical engine oil change. Engine could  withstand harsh driving. It has good life several thousands of kms.,Suzuki
Reliable handling & control help to drive in city and long drive,Suzuki
Reliable;- First time in oil service is 1000 kms to be done. But next every 2500 kms service time. On service time its billing upto 900 Rs - 1100 Rs. So it is economy scooter,Suzuki
Reliablity - is good of this scooter but has high maintenance charges.,Suzuki
Reliablity is worst and handling is good the main and positive thing is it has good and very good road grip that is tbe best and good technology the suzuki access 125 has and the pickup is very low the thing is you dont feel comfort if thr pickup is not there the problem comes only when you overtake the heavy vehicle like bus lorry exetra but the handling is good but still canot raid more than thirty killometer. So suzuki access has lot if scope to improve the scooter.,Suzuki
Remaining all things are fine with this vehicle. look wise is good...,Suzuki

Resale value - Not as good as Activa or scooty. But it is improving now due to the increasing popularity and sales.,Suzuki
"Rest every  thing is almost like activa including the price coz an Activa's on road price is Rs.41102/- and the accessories cost another 4051 depending on how many you take, but the basic ones like footrest, side stand, mat, the guards. of course you'll need. Where as in an Access the basic accessories are already there so the extras you'll need are the guars and seat cover which will be around Rs. 1500/- max and the on road price is 43290/-.",Suzuki

Rides Small bumps with ease and without letting you feel them,Suzuki
Riding - its small handle bar require getting used to but cornering is great even in high speeds.,Suzuki

Whether you're commuting to work or going on a weekend adventure, the Access 125 ensures a smooth and enjoyable journey.",Suzuki
"Riding it for about 6000 KM, never faced any issue. Electric(Self) start is fabulous. I started it even after 20 days(idle standing) it got started in one touch. Fuel consumption is OK I feel it is giving me about 42-47 KMPL in city ride. I usually drive in 30-50 km/hr range.",Suzuki
Riding quality is amazing its very very comfortable any one can use so easily its,Suzuki
Riding this scooter is pretty smooth and comfortable. Thanks to the telescopic suspension.,Suzuki
Right off the bat it is not in the same class as past get to display since I think the look of past model is decent and look of this model is tiny bit overlooped . fuel cosumption is great it is agreeable however not as past model. taking care of and control resembles past model and it is not moved forward. its front look is extremely boaring and not attractive likewise in spite of the fact that its past model was pleasant and gorgeous too.,Suzuki

Road grip - Road grip is little bit ok but often skitting problem faces several times . There is nothing good in road grip and balancing .,Suzuki
Road grip - it is above average having good road grip and good pickup.If you wanna buy this scooter then first compare with other scooters available in the market and then buy. I do no recommend you to buy this scooter.,Suzuki
Road grip : - Road grip and ground clearance of the scooty is superb and it also hold the road while driving with great balance which wont let u down,Suzuki

Road grip- Not too bad. But you have to change the tyre once in 3 years to sustain that grip,Suzuki
Road grip: - It light weight and very easy to handle as thia bike turns quickly which is need in a city like Pune. But at high speed it very hard to control this bike as even though of disc brakes it slides during braking which is risky so only good for slow driving.,Suzuki
Road grip: - the tires are of ceat I think and offer good road grip and functions good as well on wet roads and also can perforn some curves smoothly.,Suzuki
"Road grip: This bike provides very good road grip and control. This bike has disc breaks, the weight of this bike 102 kg,  it has good MRF tyres for good road grip.",Suzuki

"SO after a lot of market study my dad decided to go a head and buy access for himself as it seemed to him the best mopped against the ones available such as activa, vespa and jupiter.The suzuki access is by far the most light and zippy scooter i've ever ridden in my life.For my surprise this scooter gave an astonishing mileage of 48-50 kilo meter per liter in city and that is a lot.",Suzuki
"SOUND FROM REAR WHEEL: after using this scooter for few months one may start noticing some sound comimg from rear wheel , this problem is not restricted to my scooter only but is also found in other scooters.",Suzuki
"SOUND: the sound of this scooter is not good, its sound feels like engine has not been service from years.",Suzuki
"SUZUKI ACCESS 125 BIKE:- THE SUZUKI ACCESS 125 BIKE road price in Delhi 60.458.this bike engine 124 cc and mileage is 64 kmpl and self start are available, except for design and color, noting seems to be as per the production specification. the pick up is okay, and I don't feel the power of 125 cc.the mileage is sucked. and it's around 30-35,",Suzuki
"SUZUKI ACCESS 125 comes with BSIV and AHO to make your ride more fun.It is the best in its class. The new fresh look make its look very attractive and aerodynamic. With the all new motor, all the vibrations and high engine noise has been done away with. The mileage feature is excellent that will not pinch your pocket. The comfort of the bike along with its road grip and appeal will simply make heart fill with pride.",Suzuki
"SUZUKI ACCESS 125 is a good scooty. Scooty costs you Rs 53, 000(ex.showroom price) . It has a 125 cc single cylinder engine with two vaves per cylinder. It makes power of 7000 rpm with a torque of 5000 rpm. Scooty weights you around 110 kgs so, it has a lighty weight. It has 6L fuel tank capacity with a mileage of 55km/L. It has telescopic coil suspensions at front and swing arm type suspensions at rear. It's top speed is 90km/h. It also has a good ground clearence of 160mm.

SUZUKI ACCESS 125 is really a good bike first of all we talk about its look its look it so good that every one wants to buy it soon and wants to travel on it for there journey second it perform more mileage than oter bikes because its engine is very powerfull and take less fuel than other bikes it is so comfort that if 3 persons sit on this bike it runs smoothly it has god reliability it runs on all type of roads it runs smoothly on bad roads also it has best grip on the road the one big thing is girls can also drive it because it is made for both male and females so it is good product made by suzuki,Suzuki
SUZUKI ACCESS 125CC is a great bike in competition with other automobiles in the industry.It has some or the other some unique features in all the departments.I have white colour suzuki access 125cc and I am very proud to have it.It gives me pleasure to ride it.,Suzuki
"SUZUKI ACCESS IS SCOOTERS KING, IT'S VERY NICE SCOOTER. IAM USE THIS SCOOTER. IT'S MILLEGE IS VERY WELL AND IST PIC UP IS BRILLIANT,",Suzuki
"SUZUKI Access is an dirt bike manufactured by Suzuki apart from 2003 to 2009 .Its mileage, fuel efficiency, comport, handling, etc are not good as the another bike.Its often referred as sand-bike .There are no qualities such it should considered before.",Suzuki
SUZUKI access is giving good mileage on highway it gives 62 and in city it is giving 55 I am very happy with this top performer moped I dont y people are giving bad review may be this site is corrupted but I strongly recommend for suzuki access125 kam peeta hai it really work.,Suzuki
"Safety is given due importance in the Access 125, with features like a combined braking system(CBS) and a front disc brake. These features provide confident and controlled braking, enhancing overall safety on the road.",Suzuki
"Sales person told it give an avg of 45kmpl & was sure will not go below 40kmpl. but I never checked the mileage, because my 3rd service is already pending.",Suzuki
Scooter has four stroke engine with automatic transmission for city driving and suspension system of the scooter is well designed to avoid uncomfortable while driving.All these thing increase his comfort level.,Suzuki
"Scooter is bit heavy, but you can easily put it on main stand using simple trick with less efforts.",Suzuki
Scooter should be refined and should provide good long term usage which I think Activa does best. As compared to earlier models of access they lose thier smoothness and refinement over time.,Suzuki
Scooter twin pipe frame hold engine firmly. Looking under inside it seems vehicle is sturdy. I have reported mile age of 48km/l and I think its okey according to the terrain where I ride. Still a normal ride on leveled road a stretch is pending hope have better figures.,Suzuki
"Scooty & Wego: Scooty was the choice of many females, still men get weird looks when they are seen on Scooty as it has a girlish looks. I don't trust TVS engines since they are not robust and to my knowledge there is no Scooty I have seen used for more than 40000 kms, as every one complains of starting trouble, weak pulling and poor mileage.",Suzuki
"Scooty and wego; Scooty was the choice of many ladies, still mens get weired looks when they are seen on Scooty as it has",Suzuki
"Seat Cover(Rs180), Buzzer(60), All round guard(510), Front beeding set(460), Bumper(170), Mud Flap(50), Grip cover(60), Teflon Coating(450).",Suzuki
Seat are very good an you get charging socket which Suzuki has done great.,Suzuki
Seat can be unlock through the ignition keyhole you did not need to unlock seat from back.,Suzuki
"Seat design needs further improvement, it is not like that ""Sab ki wish kar de puri"", when I drove it myself, I always found myself sliding towards handle.",Suzuki
Seat is good 3 peoples can easily fit to this scooty no problem .,Suzuki
Seat is good and you don't slide thru to the front while applying brakes,Suzuki
"Seat is pretty high. Underseat space is quite big, full-size helmet can fit into it.",Suzuki
"Seat needs to be improved for ride.  Road griping is average. Main problem is with seat,  starter and spare parts. I give it 2 star due to high cost of spare part and easily available in the market for local service.  In some remote area,  it is difficult to go to servicing authority they have to go to local servicing centre for any repair or servicing.",Suzuki
Seating is really comfortable when compared to other bikes in the same category like Honda Activa and Hero Maestro. Suspension of the bike is excellent and comfortable when compared to Activa and Maestro.,Suzuki
Second thing mileage- image of Access 125 is not better than the Honda Activa as well as pleasure,Suzuki
See according to my opnion its not good scooter I bought it new but it cost more it gives 30 milage you can imagine how we can maintain this and the showroom service is very bad if we want booked vehile fasr they ask extra money so the showroom managers are corrupt,Suzuki
See according to my opnion its not good scooter this scooter avarage is medium quality.,Suzuki
See here there are two kinds of people one who go for MILEGE and other who go for PERFORMANCE,Suzuki
"Self start always started on 1st attempt, never tried the kick start.",Suzuki
Self starting system is so poor. And break need to change every 2-3 because if you want to start is continuously you need to press break . So plz not think to buy it.,Suzuki
"Sept 12, 2016: Suzuki motorcycle India recently launched a stylish ‘Special Edition’ variant of its flagship scooter, the Access 125, in New Delhi. Taking on the ramp, models dressed in trendy outfits walked by the retro styled Access 125 which took the centre stage at the fashion show. The special edition scooter will only be available in white colour scheme. Donning a new-maroon coloured leatherette seat cover along with circular-shaped chrome side-mirrors and a brown coloured floor board, the colour and accessories combination on the scooter looks quite appealing now",Suzuki
"Service & spares: Below average or average. In all showroom cleanliness is maintained which is very nice but the quality of the service offered is not good. I attempted servicing in 3 showrooms(SMK, JAV and Tambaram showroom), they dont even clean or replace airfilter or clean the carb, some time they top the engine oil instead of replacing, as they are focused on servicing as much as vehicle possible compromising quality.",Suzuki
"Service Center for Activa is costly. They gave 4 free coupons. But even after those coupons, Rs 450 was charged for first service. And the service center guys peeled two coupons from service book without our knowledge. After that we gave the vehicle for second and third service to a local shop. It costed Rs 350 for the same and it was good quality servicing.",Suzuki
"Service centers are very few. In a city like Hyderabad, Maruti Suzuki has more service centers than Suzuki access (LOL), and the condition is the same over the last 3 years.Result is that the servicing is pathetic.",Suzuki
"Service of the company is not good as I discussed some of my scooter's problem with them, the said that they will make it ok but yet I am facing the problem. Actually a sound is coming of loose screws.",Suzuki
Servicing and maintainance part till date I havent experienced much but I have given 3 services all are free with negligible and nominal charges.,Suzuki

Shock absorber is good in Indian road its give better suspension than any of the other Scotty Build quality of Suzuki is very good and weight of the bike is light and its look like vespa build thanks.,Suzuki
Shock absorbers - post 3 yrs the same dies not give that comfort as compared to others,Suzuki
"Shokers are ok, need improvment. Handling at turns at high speed is slight shaky.",Suzuki
Show room manager respond in a gud manner for my complaint  today I received my new access 125 . thanks 4 the response. nd the scooter was too gud  I felt really nice to drive.  .red color r is nice nd cool comfort of the scooter is gud I enjoyed driving. gud style nd comfort nd I like the locking system provided I hope it gives gud mileage too. T hanks once again for the management,Suzuki
"Showroom guys were very good at delivery timeline, accept for the later documention and RTO work procedure was bit delayed but maybe coz I didn't have proper doc's.",Suzuki
"Since Sep'11 I am using this scooter. Before moving to Suzuki access I was using 125CC bike. Before purchasing I tried & test drived TVS Vego, Activa, Deo & Access 125. Out of this Access impress a lot in terms of riding comfort, road grip & ease of handling.",Suzuki
"Since it has a very good pickup, should be little careful when u give throttle from Zero speed.",Suzuki
"Since last two months I was looking for a good scooty for my sister, so in the market if you go you will only find activa and only activa. Well but im a bit different kinda guy, I always opted for some uniqueness so why not in choosing a scooty for my sis.",Suzuki
"Since the 125cc options were limited when it was launched, the Suzuki Access caught a lot of attention from people who wanted the ease of a scooter but needed something more usable than the 110cc scooters. The looks of the Access were nothing extraordinary, and form several angles, it looked like Suzuki had copied the market leader, Activa. There were some significant changes though, in terms of features. The seat on the Access was a flat one as opposed to the bi-level seat on the Hondas. The Suzuki had the ability to open the seat from the ignition console itself.",Suzuki
"Since the company claims that it has 64km of mileage , I get approximately 40 km in kerala road condition .The 125cc engine gives me enough power to rush throung highways and easy cutting through traffics .I am pretty much satisfied with its performance.",Suzuki
Since they recently started their technicians are terrible and they doesn’t even know what is clutch issue and how to resolve it.,Suzuki
"Single-cylinder, 124cc, carbureted, 8.58bhp, 10.2Nm, CVT, 102kg; fuel tank: 5.6 litres, fuel efficiency: 45kpl",Suzuki
Skidding: I had to change my tires to Pirelli SL26 for this. Separate note below,Suzuki
"Slow city riding is a problem while balancing the vehicle with handle. Weightless .The above problem is mainly due to less weight of handle bar & scooter body. Also have a doubt about front suspension & bearing. Above all, mileage claim by company in city is hypothetical. Pricing is not matching with the scooter while taking all aspects. Let’s forgive them as they might be making experiments with customer’s money. Don’t be self judged about the sales boost of the Access, because the boom is mainly due to the problems and disrepute service of the competitor activa.",Suzuki
"So After alot of market study my dad decided to go ahead and buy and access for himself as it seemed to he the Better moped against the ones available such as activa, vespa and Jupiter.The suzuki access is by far the most light and zippy scooter I've ever ridden in my life.For my surprise this scooter gave an astonishing muleage of 48-50kmpl in city and that is alot.",Suzuki
So I Suggested Go For Honda's Vehicle they are much more stable in comparison to others.,Suzuki
"So I also didnt want to be in the save activa category, so thought of buying aviator or dio or pep+.",Suzuki
So I am hoping the above listed minor problems can be rectified in the servicing I am going to give to with in another 15 days.,Suzuki
So I am not satisfied with this bike and can't trust this bike for long trip.,Suzuki
So I appeal to not to relia on this two wheeler as due to its poor road grip you mabe in trouble at an time.,Suzuki
So I recommend you guys the Suzuki Access 125 as it is considerably one of the best Suzuki products available.,Suzuki
So I recommended go for others Vehicle they are substantially more steady in correlation.,Suzuki
"So I researched a lot before buying this, where I compared to this with a Activa 125 and other category bike which lie in this range.",Suzuki
"So I suggest before buying any Suzuki product, check whether you have a good service where you buy. (This applies common to all Suzuki product - bikes and Scooters).",Suzuki
So I think that every should try this scooty .My experience that you will not face any problem as well as.,Suzuki
"So I was about to book Honda Activa Gray/Purple for my sister, But one day I was reading some reviews on mouthshut and found that Suzuki access having more % of satisfied customers than any other scooty. There it changed my mind. Then I did lots of research on access and read lots of reviews of it.",Suzuki
"So Overall I will give 8/10 for the scooter. Its a powerful, Value for Money, family scooter",Suzuki
So according to me this scooter shows its best results in year 2017 and will going to be more better in next coming yrs.,Suzuki
So activa is much better than access except millege and suspention.,Suzuki
"So after lots of reviews on all these scooties, and lots of ups and downs, I rejected dio because it looks like more school going kid scooty, then dropped pep caz of its so thin body and it definately wont suit to me.",Suzuki
"So after many thoughts I zeroed on Suzuki Access. So I went to dealer in Rajajinagar and queried. To my surprize I got to know that 3 months is the waiting time. So I had two options wait or go for activa. But my feeling was to buy Access, so I bargained with the dealer and payed him full cost (51K with accessories ) one shot and got down the delivery to 10 days flat.",Suzuki
So after owning 2gen activas and honda dio im here to write about suzuki access ownership of 9 months( sold it by then ),Suzuki
So am strongly recommend that must not buy this product from suzuki,Suzuki
"So coming to Vehicle: Good, Smart, felt the Comfort in long ride, all of our family members praised about the vehicle.usually a machine will not give 100% performance after it being used, yes. I am facing couple problems like shutter lock is not functioning and till now I never mind about mileage in any of my bikes(Splendor, CBZ) beyond what manufacturer preferred, but there is some thing unusual is happening in the petrol consumption in my access 125. Am not interested to go again to that dealer and local mechanic will not take care with such importance. Till now just changing the engine oil every year or once in 6 months.it's going well, no major issues.i prefer it.next planning to buy same machine or suzuki swish.happy riding.",Suzuki
"So don't buy this product, its better to buy honda activa 3G.suzuki access is not resonable product.",Suzuki
"So firstly let me tell u about the Vehical Milage, it gives upto 40 per litre if we mainten well by doing time to time Services, are it may drop to 30 to 35 per litre .",Suzuki
"So folks except for the mileage, I am completely satisfied with this rocket machine (Non-Gear category). I have not got any mechanical problems with the bike ever since I bought it 7 months ago. So decide for yourself people. May be people who drive more smoothly can have a better hand on the mileage. Let me know your views.",Suzuki
So for long ride it's fuel consumption is too good as it runs at the same as well as the other bike.,Suzuki
So friends we cannot bye this scooty because of its design and specifications so go for next,Suzuki
So guys why r wastes u r money in this bike lets a thnigs bigginer a futures time worked possible for all good work so dont buy this buy the another amazing bike.,Suzuki
So here people started to chose access and hence the scooter got popular.,Suzuki
"So if you ask me. I feel this is the best scooter as compared to the other 100cc, 110cc and 125cc category .",Suzuki
"So if you want to get a spirited and agile performance from a scooter equal to a bike at the cost of little more fuel cost then go for access, but it you are concerned only about fuel efficiency, then better go with Activa, Wego or Jupiter. I think the only scooter that could beat access in performance is Vespa. But it is expensive. It is also better to buy Swish instead of access. Both are exactly same, just that swish has better looks and lighter than access.  Hope my review has helped you.",Suzuki
So in if you. Ask me to buy this scooter l'm not going to buy this and in last it's on you to buy or not to buy,Suzuki
So in rainy season it require proper servicing and 2-3 times yearly.,Suzuki
So in short I paid 71000 to the showroom after corporate discount(1350)+ 5000 cashback it fell only 65000 for me with installed mobile charger and all round steel guard.,Suzuki
"So in this way Suzuki just for sales saying 64kmpl but I am not sure according to which standards. Everything is fine like smoothness, ride quality but engine sound n vibration or vehicle belt moving felt even when driving n using Helmet. Morning start or cold start problems. exists in new model too.",Suzuki
So many types of colours and nice look is very impress me and people.,Suzuki
So my advise is that better be in 40 kmph speed in city (if you are an expert rider who can control the access even at 90+ then you can even ride at 90+ in city also no problem at all) and in highways you can be at 90+ but be carefull with the incoming traffic,Suzuki
"So my dear friends my sincere request is please dont go for access and ruin your time, money and health.......................",Suzuki
So my final opinion is that one should think twice before purchasing this scooter and rest is you decision.,Suzuki
"So my this update for mainly two reasons, first I want all the other scooty owners to learn this new kinda fatal scene with ur scooty so if ever u fall down from ur scooty and if its right handle hits the road then better first put ur scooty on main stand then take full control of it and then only starts it and never give it to weak or short or ladies like that, u need to check it completely and it s that main clutch near right handle bar. 2nd reason for the access team to work on this and remove this negative point from ur scooty as it could even make sum1s life miserable. Luckily my sister was in the local area not on the main road and she was survived from this. But its not necessary every time same thing will happen with others too, could b more could b less.",Suzuki
"So no matter whether you are driving alone or with someone else, you will never feel like the scooter is losing power. The breaking is good, milage is fine too, 40kmpl. The seats are very comfortable. The vehicle has a bit of a weight but that doesn't hamper it's smooth handling. You are gonna love to ride in this vehicle.",Suzuki
So now when can I get my vehicle please send mail communication. And also please look into this issue and resole as earliest.,Suzuki
So once again I encourage and request all people who wish to buy a Family Two Wheeler. simply go for Suzuki Access 125.,Suzuki
"So overall, I would not suggest this bike at the price point.",Suzuki
"So please for Kerala we need some more service stations for this scooter the mileage for this one is only at 30 to 35 km and the harassing paid service its very cruel in Cochin, actually in a free service, for oil change the labour charge is Rs.250.00.",Suzuki
So read this review feel good bout it & go & test ride it.I am sure this wont let u down.,Suzuki
So thats it I literally loved this scooter as at this pricing this was competitive,Suzuki
"So the Pulsar, Unicorn, Fazer kind of bikes have been selling in good numbers even though they consume relatively more fuel Similarly, scooters are no longer driven only  by  ladies and aged people. Even people who want to enjoy driving, opt for scooters due to their convenience, appearance and space. Scooters are also best to go with the family. Today it is common to see lots of college students to go on activa, dio, ray, access, vespa etc.",Suzuki
So the second version launched by Suzuki Access 125 has a lot of improvements and unlike the first version .,Suzuki
So where we used to compete with other vehicles like activa and fascino and duro .The Access 125 would run like anything . I am in love with this vehicle,Suzuki
"So why not buy a 125 cc scooter for the same price. Now the only thing I am skeptical bout is that Access is a fairly new scooter, was launched around navratri so I have no idea about its long term performance. And secondly since am a bit short was finding it difficult to rest my feet. But all in all I think it is a great scooter and the honda people have some tough competition on their hands now.",Suzuki
"So with my personal expereinece, I would higly recommend NOT TO GO with this product. I wish I would have gone with the market - Honda Activa or Aviator.",Suzuki
So without reviews as to how the performance would the bike would provide I purchased it.,Suzuki
So you can't thing that you go so far on this scooty . And also the position of handling this make really tough to drive it .,Suzuki
So! I buy it but I am not haapy with it but after use it only first time I love it and it`s mileage is very good about 45 KM to 50KM it is seat give very comfort and it have reliability and it`s road grip is very very good it is better than activa . When I drive it I never move the handel because when I give force on any side it automaticly turn in that direction and it become to touch my side foot stad to touch to ground but it`s girp on road give balance to drive it and it speed is 1 to 50 km/h in only 15 to 20 sec and in less time also I appeal you to buy it,Suzuki
"So, I suggest access 125 who need a powerful and comfortable ride.",Suzuki
"So, finally I decided to go for either of Honda Aviator or Suzuki Access. I went to SMK showroom at Guindy, Chennai one evening. I found that they are offering me 26k for my Activa, which is pretty decent to my opinion, as I had to already repair the vehicle. Hence I booked my Access, as also the height is less and hence my wife could also manage to get both her foot on the ground. The weight of the vehicle is less than Activa (109 kgs compared to 117 kgs of Activa). After going for the test ride, I got impressed with the vehicle. Finally I got the vehicle delivered on last Sunday, the 14th of March, 2010. I took my wife along and traveled back home with the vehicle, a distance of around 16 kms from my home. The ride was smooth and I never felt the weight of the pillion rider, as I used to do in Activa. After then since now I have traveled a distance of around 370 kms. Still now the pickup and smoothness of the vehicle is amazing. With the powerful 125 cc engine compared to Honda's 110 cc, whatever the traffic may be, the vehicle just cruises through the crowd. The brakes are very powerful, which gave me more comfort and elegance to handle it around the traffic. Even I have twisted and turned around the heavy traffic, but it never showed a single sign to skid. Overall I am highly satisfied with the vehicle's performance.",Suzuki
"So, the all-new Suzuki Access 125 is lighter, fuel efficient and has universally acceptable looks. At Rs 53, 887(ex-showroom Delhi), it's also a couple of thousand rupees less expensive than the segment leader Honda Activa 125. Prices for the disk brake variant - the one we are riding - are yet to be announced. So, in all, the all-new Suzuki Access 125 could be all the scooter you could ask for. The question that remains is - how it stacks up against its competition. We'll of course be doing a full-fledged comparison test with its immediate competitors - the Honda Activa 125 and the Mahindra Gusto 125, and we have a feeling it's going to be a really close finish to pick a winner.",Suzuki
"Some one may think that I have been paid for this review, bur take it from me that I am one of the first 100 buyer from Ahmedabad in 2006. I am still using it with pride that I am access owner.",Suzuki
Some people may feels that it is costly. The opinion about the price about the scooter may vary from person to person but according to my opinion this scooter is best and you should go for it,Suzuki
Some peoples demands to a bike best for rides nd cantroler but he not sufficeint to this work nd real drives.,Suzuki
"Some updates. after completing 22, 000 Kms, 2 years & 12 services",Suzuki
"Something tells me Suzuki is going to get lucky this time, by giving people just what they want.",Suzuki
Sooo I wanna get scooter and bought this scooter because its best,Suzuki
Spacious leg space and good storage space. strong body when compared to activa and other scooters.,Suzuki
Spacious: Large seat will give you extra comfort and two hooks in front for carrying extra baggage.,Suzuki
"Specification Engine 4 cycle 1 cylinder, air cooled, fuel system carborater, start system - kick and eletric.",Suzuki
Specifications are good aswell.gaves milenge between 50 to 60 kpl good milenge and good to see this bike.,Suzuki
Specifications: When we talk about Scooty then there are much better options available instead of Suzuki Access 125 as this doesn't gave good mileage and it makes very noisy sound too which is very frustrating. The looks of the scooty is quite good and impressive but when we analyze the overall performance then it is not so good to buy.,Suzuki
Sportrider.com/ride/146_9508_motorcycle_riding_tips/index.html,Suzuki
"Stability - This is the best quality of this scooter. It is completely stable at any speed, no vibrations, no fear of skidding.",Suzuki
"Standard look and has attractive features. Very comfortable seat and feels happy to ride. I have bought this in 2013 it works too good. Powered by a 125cc air cooled, 4 stroke single cylinder engine, this is equipped with automatic transmission for convenience while riding",Suzuki
Starting trouble in cold regions in winters. May be all scooters have it. Flyte has used  high ampere battery removing cold start problems,Suzuki
Starting with looks the looks of suzuki access 125 is good but not best yes it ok looks wise but does not have that appeal which deo or pleasure or maestro has.,Suzuki
Starts with the mileage this Scooter give mileage of approximate to 40kmpl and the price of this Scooter is 61900Rs. ??????. Only peoples who are mad buy this Scooter and and as like all Scooter it as a f* king road grip.,Suzuki
"Stiff competition from the Activa 125Sept 12, 2016: Suzuki motorcycle India recently launched a stylish ‘Special Edition’ variant of its flagship scooter, the Access 125, in New Delhi. Taking on the ramp, models dressed in trendy outfits walked by the retro styled Access 125 which took the centre stage at the fashion show. The special edition scooter will only be available in white colour scheme. Donning a new-maroon coloured leatherette seat cover along with circular-shaped chrome side-mirrors and a brown coloured floor board, the colour and accessories combination on the scooter looks quite appealing now",Suzuki
Still I don't have any problem with this service centers are good all areas and engine life time is good its driving is smooth and comfort.,Suzuki
Storage space It has ample space under the seat to keep a helmet or other items. There is an optional glovebox that is available at a cost of Rs 800 which I have installed.,Suzuki
"Storage: Apt or perfect. Can hold a helmet and water bottle under the seat, front space can easily fit an 10 year old girl.",Suzuki
"Styling is very good, performance no-doubt is excellent, mileage has improved, comfortable for long rides.",Suzuki
"Suddenly I found SUZUKI ACCESS and I found that look wise it was better then activa. Power is a great key feature fo this scooter. Company is claiming 60KMPL mileage and price was almost same. Its unisex looks impressed me. So I buy the access. It costs me 43365 on road with accessories (without stapney), Insurance and registration (including number plates).",Suzuki
"Suddenly, the vehicle will stop. Then you can decide about your future, for other vehicles like Honda Activa there are more service centres even normal mechanic will attend but for this vehicle nobody will attend,",Suzuki
Suguki skooty was nice or dig space and cc is 125. Full congum avrage 60 to 45 km. Tnat skooty was cary with exgest 3parson with 1 lugare in frount of rider.

"Sum up: If you are male and concerned about paying less go for it, but if you are female still a decent choice but give it a second thought.",Suzuki
Superb leg room for driver and very comfortable seating for the pillion,Suzuki
"Suspension and millege is better in access, also it has more power and pickup, storage space is good and has 6lts petrol tank.",Suzuki
"Suspension- gliding over pot holes is easy, the shocks are very good, however the ride is stiff if solo driven but with pillion rider the ride quality improves greatly",Suzuki

"Suzuki access 125 is a gearless scooter. I purchased this scooter in 2012. until now so many issues with the scooter. mileage is very poor, it is not even getting 20-30 Kms. never it gave the promised millage. Mileage was depends Upon How U Ride And How U Maintain .I have being giving scooter for servicing regularly to the authorised service center. whenever I ride upon speed breaker or even little bad road patch I feel like driving a old rickshaw as suspension works so hard . its fibre body is very delicate it got broken even by small hit. Sometimes The moment scooter goes over speed breaker, engine is switched off. There are several times when scooter has stopped in middle of the road and other vehicles almost have come and about to hit me from behind. I have shown to service center several times however there is no solution . I think suzuki has to be solve this kind of serious problem. Everybody is saying that even my mechanic friend says airfilter design of this scooter is not good.Airfilter is right above the rear tyre. And it sucks dust and water. All dust particles will go in combustion chamber to spoil the bore and piston. the scooters spare parts are costly & maintenance charges are high. totally disappointing experience for me. Purchasing an access was my biggest mistake.",Suzuki

They are several other factors that effect mileage, I agree but, even after regular services mileage never improved. Comfort is good. Even in bad road conditions you can sit comfortably and drive. The bike I think not much reliable because in the second month after I purchased this bike, one day it suddenly stopped in the middle of the road. I had to change my air filter in the showroom. I hardly travel 10 km per day. just for 600 km I had my air filter replaced. Road grip is good. one may not fear of skidding. Even in rainy season it gives quite good grip on wet roads. The appeal is good, the color and finishing of the fiber body is really nice.",Suzuki

I, though, would wait for the disc model to go on sale.",Suzuki

"Suzuki now steps in with the all-new Access 125 and quite evidently, the new design has premium written all over it. The chrome bezel around the headlamp, mature styling elements and the right amount of modern touches make this scooter quite a looker.

"Suzuki really has to look at this since they advertise mainly on 125 segment other than look wise got similar vehicles in the market right from Mahindra, Yamaha, Activa, TVS vespa etc but top slot is is with Honda only, suzuki want to compete they really has to make changes to engine which real 125 feel:-)",Suzuki
Suzuki recently launched its new scooter in India - Suzuki Access and I got a chance to experience this scooter through one of friend who is crazy about Suzuki. Although he has Suzuki Sport bike he bought this one for his daughter for city travel.,Suzuki
"Suzuki says underseat storage is best-in-class at 21 litres. It can accommodate a small bag, a book or two and a full face helmet, all within the same space! What is sorely missed is a USB power socket; although there's space for an optional power socket, you will have to get that installed at your own cost, not at the dealer, but out in the grey market.",Suzuki
"Suzuki service is available in almost all the cities and u get good service and delivery as promised. Since the vehicle is not that heavy it's easy for girls , so I undoubtedly say is a GIRL'S BEAST.",Suzuki
"Suzuki service people estimated Rs: 12000 for rectification. They said they have to change entire internal engine parts. I fed with Suzuki Access. Spares are not available outside market, even oil filter also not available on outside market. I suggest the people don’t buy Suzuki access",Suzuki
Suzuki should work for better average because all other non gear are giving more average rest all thing aur awesome 1 should try it,Suzuki
"Suzuki when launched the scooter in india market, all scooters almost have very calmly setteled at 90 cc or 110 cc with 8 bhp. A few years before we need powerful than scooty pep or activa the only option that is Suzuki ACCESS, which was instantly explore. Ah there was the vespa and mahindra guesto too, Even today the that last is still limited, with the only new additions being the Activa125 and aprilia 150.",Suzuki
Suzuki's Access 125 is a best scooter in the market. There is no other scooter in the market for comparison with Access 125. You will get attracted just for watching it. The fit and finishing on access 125 is really great and attractive. It can attract the customer easily. The handling is very smooth in access 125. It gives 65 kmpl easily. Even though you can get mobile charger on fit in access 125. There is lots of space to keep your needs very safely. Handling is very smooth. Easy to overtake. The suspension is also great. It is very peppy to drive. Acceleration is also very good. and it is a budget scooter for every individual. It is a smoother and lighter scooter so it can cross the miles of distance easily. If you are planning to buy a better one then my suggestions would be just go for Suzuki's Access 125 blindly.,Suzuki
Suzuki's Access 125 is a better scooty. This is a fuel saving Suzuki.Its a best choice. I also have suzuki access 125 about whige colour. It have a large fuel containg tank as compare to Honda's Activa. It gives good mileage on highways but poor in crowded areas resulting from heavy traffic. Its pickup is good. Easy to push and didnot make so much of noice. Its a lot more durable than other scootys. Its engine is also heavy as compare compared to that of hondas activa. But its body design isn't really so good as that of Activa. Its looks like ladies scooty from back side. But still you’re able to prefer to use it in your business. Sanctioned good scooty as compare to honda activa with the exception that body design. Otherwise access 125 is best when compared to activa.,Suzuki

"Suzuki, finally, haven’t held back on the features either. The underseat cavity has significant intrusions but is still 21 litres in volume. I don’t mind the underseat filler cap though outside is obviously more convenient. The single key slot is also joined by a cigarette lighter charging socket and a manual choke lever on the inside of the apron.",Suzuki

"THE SCOOTER PICKS UP REALLY GREAT, THE PERFOMANCE IS REALLY SMOOTH, HANDLING IS LIGHT AN MAKES THE RIDER FEEL REALLY CONFIDENT,",Suzuki
"THE SUZUKI ACCESS 125 IS THE BEST SCOOTER IN THIS SEGMENT LIKE PERFORMANCE WISE. IT HAS GOOD MILEAGE ABOUT 64 KMPL, SMOOTH TO DRIVE, HIGH PICK UP, VERY GOOD BALANCE, HANDLING AND CONTROL ARE VERY GOOD, IT HAS VERY GOOD LOOK SHAPE IS AERODYNAMICS IT HAS LESS DRAG TO DRIVE .",Suzuki
THEIR SELLING TRICK.WE NOT RECOMEND ANY ONE TO BUY ACCESS 125.SERVICE CENTER MANAGER GD MOTORS KRISHNA NAGAR DELHI SAID AFTER 1ST SERVICE.ITIS NOT A BIKE IT GIVE AROUND 25 TO 35 MILAGE,Suzuki
"THERE ARE ALLOY WHEELS AN TUBELESS TIRES WHICH ARE REALLY LONG LASTING AN HASSLE FREE, THERE IS DISC IN THE FRONT AN DRUM BREAKS IN THE REAR, THERE IS ALSO THE FEATURE OF COMBINED BREAKING WHICH LARGELY REUCES CHANCES OF MISHANLING AN ACCIDENTS",Suzuki
THIS BIKE IS A VERY BEAUTIFUL AND STYLISH BIKE TO OTHERS BIKE HI IS A BEST TO OLD GENERATION STYLE AND HE WAS A VERY QUET AND ALWAYS TO RIDE TO A OTHER ROAD TO STARTUP TO THE ALL ROAD BUT BIKE DRIVE IS A VERY COMFERTABLE TO THE SITNESS AND HIS POWERFUL INGINE 125CC AND VERY SPEED TO THIS POWER THIS BIKE A TYRE WAS A VERY SPECIAL GRIP TO THE BIKE TYRE NOT SLEEP TO THE ALL TIME THIS IS SPEEDOMETER IS AMAZING TO TAKE DRIVE AND YOU ARE LOOK IS SO BEAUTIFUL THIS A INDIAS FIRST GRANDFATHER'S BIKE AND THIS LIKE A VERY DIFFERENT TO ALWAYS GIVE A GRANDFATHER'S TO A VERY SPECIAL TO THE RIDE WITH SAFETY AND HE GIVE TO MILAG 60KMPH ABOVE PLEAS GET NOT LET FOR FUN GRANDFATHER,Suzuki
THIS BIKE MAKE YOUR JOURNEY EASY WITH COMFORT TO ALL HAPPY JOURNEY.,Suzuki
THIS IS A VEHICLE WHICH MOST OF MY FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE AND USE FOR BOTH OFFICE PURPOSE AND HOME USE IT IS LESS COSTLIER THAN OTHER SCOOTER LIKE VESPA WHICH IS NEARLY A LAKH WELL THIS IS NOT AND THAT IS A GREAT ADVANTAGE OF THIS SCOOTER AS IT GIVE GREATT MILEAGE THAN VESPA AND MORE BOOT SPACE AS WELL.,Suzuki
THIS ONE KIND OF FAMILY FAMILIAR BIKE FOR THE ALL MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY. THIS IS MORE POWERFUL GEARLESS BIKE. IT HAS A BIG SPACE UNDER THE SEAT FOR STORAGE PURPOSE. AS A GEARLESS BIKE FUEL COSUMPSION IS BETER AROUND 45KMPL. COMFORT LEVEL ALSO GOOD. DURING THE RAINY SEASON WHEN THE BRAKE APPLIED IT SLIPS. MAY BE TIRE ARE TO BE REPLACED WITH GOOD QUALITY. THE LIGHT QUALITY ALSO NOT GOOD. WITHIN THE TOWN THIS IS GOOD. BUT OUTSIDE THE LIGHT IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH. THE SPEAKER OF THE HORN ALSO GOOD ENOUGH. ITS LOOK IS VERY GOOD. AS THIS IS A SMOOTH BIKE EVERY ONE OF THE FAMILY MAY BE GIRLS OR BOYS CAN USE THIS. THE BEST THING IS THE KEY HOLE IS SAME FOR THE BIKE TO START AND SAME FOR THE CARRIAGE TO OPEN.THIS BIKE CAN BE RUN 30 KM WITHIN THE CITY.,Suzuki
"THough both the scooters have an uncanny similarity in design, what they differ is in engine capacity, power and suspension.",Suzuki
"TIP - To obtain a good milage, ensure that you do not raise the engine for the first 5 - 10 mins of your drive. That is till the engine is fully heated. Ofcourse, once the engine is fully heated, the Access can just fly. You can touch 40 - 45, with minimal throttle and minimum vibration.",Suzuki
TO  be honest I love this scooter. it gives you a mileage of about 64 kmpl and approx 91 km/hr top speed at this price it has many functions and the best thing is about mileage and nowadays in every street you will most probably come across this beast it has one of the best suspensions and it has a power of 8.7PS@7000rpm RPM is referred to revolutions per minute but every good thing has something bad about it so the bad thing is it does not have a good road grip it is reliable but I would suggest others to buy it. it is one of the best scooters overall where most of the scooters have engine of 110cc it has 125cc that make's it a total BEAST,Suzuki
TODAY IS 11-1-11 AND WE WILL WAIT TILL YOU HELP US . THE PROBLEM HAS INCREASED nowadays. please please please . it should be solved as soon as possible reply for this PLEASE,Suzuki
"Taking about reliability, if we talk about its body and chasis it is very strong as it is suzuki make.but it is very bad when it comes on engine performance. I think suzuki has more to do with their two wheeler vehicles.",Suzuki
"Taking note of this situation, the Japanese two-wheeler giant recently launched the new Suzuki Access 125. The bland styling was among the biggest drawbacks of the Access 125 and it wasn’t the most appealing scooters on sale.",Suzuki
Talking about its design its not very impressive its a pretty basic design. The design is not sleek and fashionablebut instead its quiet big and unapealing.,Suzuki
Talking about the design we would say improvisation in design is good but somewhat lacks uniqueness.Pickup is a good point to be appreciated but with good pickup lacks the keep of mileage with time running.After few years of good usage mileage deceased apparrently.otherwise talking about the comfort it is good and reliable over the time.Road grip is better comparitively.A perfect bike to use I would say to use,Suzuki
"Talking about the mileage it's less than Jupiter, wego, and activa and doesn't give much mileage than this .",Suzuki
Talking about the performance honestly off again does not make you disappoint with punchy Low end at 10.24nm of torque at 6000rpm and 8.58 bhp is more than enough for this scooter.,Suzuki
Talking about this motor- cycle the pick upp of this bike is very much so it consume very much petrol and so it is not good average bike. For general use thi bike is not good because the milage is not good and it costly,Suzuki
Tge service is quick and satisfactory no complaints with the service or the reliability of the bike as it is Very reliable.,Suzuki
Tge worst product in the 2 wheeler section is the suzuki acess and all ither suzuki products as whenever I had tried to buy an vehical I had gone for an suzuki product and always it had been an end for me as there are not at all service centre at my place and the special service of yhis vehical costs abiut rupees 2000 for 1 tume which an normal activa or bike takes only rupees 200-300 for full service si its the main thing I had disliked and that too the special centres are 20-40 km far away from my place so ihaf never thought about that products. Thanks.,Suzuki
Thank you for veiw my review of suzuki access 125 plzz like qnd comment,Suzuki
"Thanks to Planet main Dealer, they somehow arrange the paper delivery. When I visit Sunshine showroom to collect the paper, Dhaval literally insulted me",Suzuki
"Thanks to the change in the engine and gear oils, when I leave the accelerator, the vehicle moves at least double the distance during engine braking.",Suzuki
That bike's break is very smoother and it's seat is very comfortable for older.,Suzuki
That handling is superb same like activa & I think they both score same here.,Suzuki
That time we was asked for the first servicing date they told they will inform by call or message. We were cool and waiting for the update from service center. We have received update directly for second service not received for first. This is not good. I have taken this incident as an example but there are other issues also we faced with them.,Suzuki
"That too the dealer guides us to approach a vehicle broker, who gives delivery on the spot.To report the same, we wrote to company thru it's website customer feed back form.",Suzuki
That we can choose with our budget the only scooter of its comparison is activa 125 but due to light weight of #acess and many new features like #digital display #shut push,Suzuki
That's for now. I will update you after 1st service. Please let me know your comments about my observations.,Suzuki
Thats the speciality and greatness of Acess 125.(Wrost parts).,Suzuki
The 12-inch front wheel and the telescopic front forks give the Access 125 superla,Suzuki
"The 12-inch front wheel and the telescopic front forks give the Access 125 superlative handling, and the variant we are riding - with the front disk brake - shaves off speed quite effortlessly, holding its line even under hard braking. During our test ride, I had to slam the brakes in urgency as an impatient driver swerved in front of me across a cut in the road divider. The tyres gripped impressively, with just a slight twitch of the tail, but the scooter didn't lose composure. So, full marks there, for emergency braking!",Suzuki
"The Access 125 Special Edition is styled with a trendy, maroon coloured leatherette seat cover. It comes with a special edition logo, round shaped chrome mirrors and brown coloured floor board which give the scooter a retro look and make it stand out in a crowd. This retro stNew Stylish rounded chrome mirrors to give a retro and stylish look to the mirroryle is guaranteed to appeal to trend conscious riders",Suzuki
"The Access 125 is Suzuki Motorcycle India's first star performer in the rapidly growing automatic scooter segment. In a way, the Access 125 paved the way for Suzuki's first firm foothold in the highly competitive scooter market.

The Access 125 is a good two wheeler in its segment with an improvised eye catchy look. The comfort was awesome with ample space below the seat and with some specific upgraded features. Overall the Access is better than its competitors with nice price tag.,Suzuki
The Access 125 new looks are very classic.suzuki made new access very different in design.,Suzuki
"The Access 125 variant we tested is the one with the optional front disk brake. Well, for one, we found the disc to work effectively well in shaving-off speed effortlessly when some locals tried to test our braking ability. The updated Access 125 has a lot of room on offer. It gets one of the longest seats in its segment and also a large under-seat storage of 21 litres. So you can chuck in quite a few things, but there won’t be enough room for your full-face helmet.",Suzuki
The Access has 25 cc more capacity than Activa with a higher bhp and torque rating. All this translates into quick acceleration & lugging power on inclines like flyovers.,Suzuki
"The Access is Suzuki's best-selling bike in India and though it won't match the Activa when it comes to sales figures, it has helped Suzuki dig into a segment which has long been a Hero and Honda dominated market. The Access is powered by a 125cc single-cylinder engine that produces 8.5bhp and the CVT helps in smooth delivery of power. The Access comes with four colour options - Candy Red, Pearl White, Metallic Silver and Metallic Black and competes with the Activa.",Suzuki

The mileage is good, Pickup and ride comfort is good. supention is good. still body .compared to activa is suspention is good its all rounder scooter.i dis like is only 650oil capasity in 125cc .difficult to turn in city.also having previde bad servicing experience. but the new scooter I like more comfartable .camparing to toher scooters if u want to bay family scooter then it is good one.",Suzuki
"The Bajaj purchased 10 yrs before was with me till I purchased this access & the odo reading was only 13, 000 km. From this you can imagine my two-wheeler usage.",Suzuki
The Bike is very similar to the competitive bikes which makes this bike a little boring. But we can also say that the look of the bike is very standard.,Suzuki
The Bikes makes a lots of noise while riding which disturbs me as well as surrounding. Also the average is worst part of the Scooty.,Suzuki
The CBS braking works very well and the stopping power is really good. The ride and handling is outstanding and the bumps and potholes are absorbed very well. The city mileage is 50 kmpl while the highway mileage is 55 kmpl! The top speed is 90 km/h. The scooter cruises ahead effortlessly even between 70 - 80 km/h. The storage is enough to put a half sized helmet along with a small handbag in it.,Suzuki
The CVT feature ensures that the bike gives enough power at all times. Suzuki claims that Access gives a mileage of 64Kmpl. The Suzuki access 125 is a better performing scooter in the 125 cc segment.,Suzuki
"The Headlight though attractive lacks good focus. The good part is with the down focus, light falls atleast 10 mtrs ahead of you, so you are prepared to dodge any obstacles comfortably in that distance.",Suzuki
"The LOOKS :  They are cute and proportionate.  You could say they had a retro touch.  Scooters had a glorious past and many different body styles had evolved earlier.  This one takes clues from the past and blends it with up-to-date features.  The key is typical Suzuki (long) but on the other end (plastic head) there was an unusual hexagonal shape.  This I was told is part of the security feature on the scooter.  It operates in a space next to the keyhole.  This opens a sliding diaphragm, which exposes the keyhole.  Neat.  In other words, if the diaphragm is closed, the would-be thief / tamperer would not have any ACCESS to start the vehicle.  In the rains, this feature would also double up to keep unwanted moisture at bay.  Nice touch I would say.  Just one of the many features which show that they CARE.",Suzuki
The Mileage Of These Moped Is Worst. Co. Tells About 65km but it gives something about 35-40km.,Suzuki
The Only Gearless Bike by Suzuki in India is The Access. I have used this bike for couple of days and giving my review about this bike.,Suzuki
The Pickup of this scooty is very low and if we drive this with two person its became very slow and during drive its noise also gone changed automatically and suddenly some times the smoke also came very high,Suzuki
The Suspension is also very good & can be felt when applying brakes. The vehicle gives max mileage at speed of 45-50.So Folks Do hav a test ride and Get it at your parking.,Suzuki
"The Suzuki Access 125 has a rectangular shaped headlamp surrounded with chrome which gives it a premium look. Other features are very plain and simple. Design wise it has yet to catch up with other bikes of 125cc category. The scooter comes in Pearl deep blue, Metallic Fibroin Grey, Candy Sonoma red, Glass sparkle black, Pearl mirage white, Metallic sonic white",Suzuki
The Suzuki Access 125 has a retro-design. It is one if the best selling bikes in India and is giving a tough competition to the Honda Activa 125. The Access has a conservative design compared to other bikes of 125cc category.,Suzuki
The Suzuki Access 125 has good average which ranges between 35 to 45 . On using the bike carefully by first the bike gives good average. The consumtion of fuels is best means it goes more on small amount of fuel. The bike is comfortable for long drives . Due to long drive the bike respons well. In the non-gear bike the suzuki access is at the top. It has good accerelation and briliant pickup. The bike goes up to 80 kph in range. It has good handling facility . While the bike is at top speed it can get easily control different than all. It looks very comfortable and interesting. Thankyou.,Suzuki

People think more power means less mileage but that doesn't apply to the Access! With the Access, you get both power and mileage! The scooter's SEP engine and 102 kg kerb weight makes this possible! The Access's engine refinement is the best! No other scooter has been able to match the Access in this department.

You've got to ride it to understand what I am saying.",Suzuki
"The Suzuki Access misses out on the external fuel cap. I also found the AHO feature disappointing. Honestly, AHO should be made mandatory in places where there is fog but not in the whole of India. It simply wastes the battery of all the scooters in the market. The government messed up big time on this perhaps intentionally to benefit manufacturers because the consumer will now have replace the light bulb and battery sooner than they would like it. Had the head light been a LED make, the AHO feature would have made sense on the Access but Suzuki skimped on this. I did not like this from Suzuki's end!",Suzuki

The mileage of this bike was poor approx 35-40 kms in normal road condition and in highway road condition approx 45-50 kms of this bike. The power and pickup of this bike was superb but the service and support of this bike was very worst.,Suzuki

They surely have understood the like mind of indian customes. Its also provide cellphone charging facility in it which is very much good.

The all new Suzuki Access 125 is first in its segment with 125 cc revamped appealing design and is loaded with a bunch of new features.,Suzuki
The all new Suzuki Access 125 is one of the best scooter released by the Suzuki. I bought this couple of months ago and testing on it that is it really good or not but its really comfortable and stylish and economy too. I felt very convent while riding on it even the seat space is very long you can sit three peoples comfortably and its space for containing various items is very depth and large in compare of other scooters and a very good switch key system attached with the power switch for accessing on your dicky overall its good and give proper millage as promise. A good one by Suzuki.,Suzuki
The all new Suzuki access 125 non other than better scooter and with best in class mileage and powerful performance with there new silk design and better access . The all new access have mileage 64 but in a road he give 55-60 mileage is better than activate 125 and acceleration is exellent with all new pickup power compare to activate 125 is not a good with access 125 for price,Suzuki
The all new suzuki access its so comfortable and large siting space and lightweight scooter and  good 1225cc engine gives  60To 65 kmpl mileage its sufficient. and about suzuki this brand knows all and its own automaker over world wide.,Suzuki
"The all-new Access 125 looks big, and quite handsome. It's cut out in gracious lines rather than being fashionably hip and doesn't make a loud, brash statement.",Suzuki
"The apathy from them is just beyond imagination. In today's world, at least the manufacturer and/or distributors of ACCESS 125 just do not bother for the csutomers even if he/she loses the life. Please think twice before you buy it. I am sure life is more precious that anything else.",Suzuki
The appeal was that the company should retake it from every where and make it lighter and.with more attrative looks.,Suzuki
The are many misconseptions about the MILAGE but if u do an proper mentainance and proper driving it gives an promising 40kmpl milage for sure.,Suzuki
The arrangement of the handle and seat is pretty comfortable than any other scooters I have ride on.The balance is very soothly done and back pain is not affected very much.,Suzuki
"The average also noted very low its found below 35 or 30 KM PL due to this its found so costly, After some months only its many functions gone stopped working automatically like self start, Right side indicator or some plastic parts",Suzuki
"The average of this is 30 -35 kmpl only which is very less compare other.after using some month, it's self start function stopped automatically.there are increasing so many fault in it day by day",Suzuki
The back rear shock is also very good. The ground clearance is also very good. The weight is ideal for the scooter. Thus it very useful for a gents also due t its large appearance.Now I have I new problem.It stalls when riding in rain. Do anyone have this problem.,Suzuki

The balance is quite good as I don't have to let my feet down on the road even at very low speeds.,Suzuki
The battery is located below the footboard. This makes it easy to access from a maintenance point of view. Activa has the battery in the front where the front body needs to be removed to access it.,Suzuki

"The best part about this scooter is its new and improved 124cc engine. Producing 8.5bhp and 10.2Nm, power and displacement remain the same, but this motor is lighter and uses the company’s SEP tech to improve performance and efficiency. Considering the reduction in weight, the new Access feels very brisk off the line. The way the engine goes about its business is highly commendable. It’s smooth and very refined. The engine didn’t feel stressed while maintaining speeds of 70-75kph down the highway, and it returned a satisfactory 45kpl while at it.",Suzuki
"The best scooty in it's segment.I am riding this vehicle since 4 years and I am fully satisfied with its performance.it is the more powerful vehicle in its segment .its handling is very good , I feel it't handling better than any other scooty.but there is one problem with the vehicle, it's odometer is not working properly it gets damaged within a short period of time.over all the scooty is a good deal to have.",Suzuki
The best thing about this is its pick up. It has a high pick up compared to its competitors. And also its seat is wide enough and comfortable. The only thing I didn't like about it is its front Suspension and their design they are Telescopic but a little long in length.,Suzuki
The best thing about this vehicle is the acceleration power but the only downfall is rear brakes other wise everything is perfect and there is one more good feature that you can open the tool box compartment from the key lock itself.,Suzuki
"The best thing is its pickup.i garauntee it that no other scooty can have as fast as pickup comapre to suzuki . Everyone will say our vehicle gives 60 average but it is not correct . after few time it reduces. You can find different colors here.like grey , white , black.",Suzuki

"The bland styling was among the biggest drawbacks of the Access 125 and it wasn’t the most appealing scooters on sale. Gladly, Suzuki designers have taken stock of the situation and given the new Access 125 a fresh lease of life with respect to its appearance.",Suzuki
"The body is rust-free as it is made mostly of fibre glass. However, a significant impact may cause it to break, in which case the only option would be to replace the entire panel. In my opinion, the chance of this happening is quite rare. Any scratches and nicks can be fixed at the paint shop.",Suzuki
The body of bike made of very low quality material.Even it don't give you full mileage.and also it don't look great like other scooters in market.,Suzuki
"The boys generation is becomes the huge fan of tha suzuki access 125. The look is so much good of that scooter. The suzuki access is available in different colors like blue, black, silver. Etc. I bought blue colour suzuki access. Also is having super mileage. Mileage is 40km",Suzuki
The brakes of the scooty are also good which makes the ride safe.,Suzuki
"The braking was taken care of  by drums on both the wheels.  The rear brake seemed to be more responsive as compared to the front and together they managed to haul down the vehicle pretty rapidly.  So no issues here.  The vehicle when in motion was quite silent and no vibration could be felt anywhere.  Not from the footboard, nor from the seat or from the handlebar.  This means that this scooter is extremely well engineered and designed to give you an enjoyable ride without the hassles that normally accompany the ride.",Suzuki
The brand of suzuki access 125 is very hopeful its presence his company status its road on grip was so much its 125 cc enjen was practically comfortable runnig so fastly that his own maintenance was chiefly so much girls shoud be like it because its figure( its design) was very good,Suzuki
The bs4 new modal scooty head lamp is nice continuous lighting .,Suzuki
"The build quality of vehicle is first class. Handling even in heavy traffic is comfortable.its suspension is pretty good and gives us smooth ride even on bad roads.over taking is easy task on this vehicle, but I am only just satisfied with the braking.a front disc brake could have given a great confidence to the scooter.",Suzuki
The built quality was good but not that much intrested and reliable.and in this some of the impirtant parts has been covered with the plastic and which were useful some times.,Suzuki
"The calculated EMI for Suzuki Access 125 is Rs. 1, 604 per month @ 9.45% for a tenure of 36 months for a loan amount of  Rs. 50, 100.

"The central lock should be improved. If u have a bike with central lock, try to open it by twisting ur finger. It opens easily. It  no longer matters but it should be appropriate.",Suzuki
The central locking system(one key for the ignition as well as the seat storage) is useful as you would need just one key. The shutter over the ignition key-hole is also a good security mechanism.,Suzuki
The centrel locking is great.Specialy the key entrence  blocking.,Suzuki
The chrome plated part of the exhaust gives the vehicle a unique look. The front indicators are not located in the handle bar which is a welcome change from the regular styling. The Access 125 being priced about 3000.00 higher than the Activa should have featured a front disk brake. But overall the vehicle is worth it.,Suzuki
The color of Scooter also gone dull and its not seems new and stylish and we never received any kind of appreciation during using the same,Suzuki
The comfort is gud and all it takes very nicely seats well cushioned,Suzuki
The comfort is okay in my terms. Seat quality comes okay with decent cushioning.,Suzuki
The comfort level of this bike is very very good and totally satisfied from sitting and using this and feels more enjoyable to ride on this.,Suzuki
The comfort level of this scooter is also not much good it is very uncomfortable to sit on the seat of this scooter.,Suzuki
The company Suzuki has been producing many different models in cars as well as bikes from soo many years. For cars I would prefer and recommend suzuki.,Suzuki
The company claims that the scooty should be services once in 3 months and a services costs around 1500 bucks . The engine provides a good pickup than any other scooty . But pros is one and cons are many .,Suzuki
The company does not seem to care what the costumer has to say. Yesterday the body of my access cracked with a loud sound. Instead of accepting the fault they are giving me all kinds of excuses.  Think twice before you buy this vehicle.,Suzuki
"The comparison game might sound cool speaking about specifications, what is good what is not. But we need to make an important statement that all of the comparison scooters had made entry into the market at the right time. This is the reason why they all were a hit to an extent, but unlike Activa which is rolling out still in large number, Vespa 125 had limited success. Now let us take you through the comparison between the 125 cc segment scooter with specifications and overview.",Suzuki
"The comparison game might sound cool speaking about specifications, what is good what is not. But we neee vehicle these  vehicle family.",Suzuki
The dealer did not have the complete accessory set when I bought the bike; had to go back after 10 days to get the accessories fixed.,Suzuki
"The dealers of suzuki claim that since the vehicle is new, and the mileage will increase after 1 or 2 services.",Suzuki
"The dealers say they offer genuine spare parts but I believe 100 percent they dont provide the genuine parts. They say that parts life depend on the driver of the bike. Yes, I agree but Are we small children and dont know how to ride a bike? This is only a starting point of my trouble.",Suzuki
The design  and style of suzuki access 125 looks very beautiful. also we have more color available in market. you can choose any one of them and enjoy the ride.,Suzuki
The design is good but performance as per review not good. I think there is some issue with engine.,Suzuki
"The design is somrwhat similar to the first gen Activa.it starts vibrating aftertouching 60.mileage is not at all great. Except the front telescopic suspensions it has got nothing excellent to offer! Activa110/125, Aviator, Jupiter, Wego, Vespa go for these.way better than Suzuki Access",Suzuki
The design is too good . the performance is worst . first it is not a fuel efficient scooter I am using it from last 4 years . my fuel expence is too much compairing to other scooters .,Suzuki
The design of this scooter is something type of retro classic. You get a readable instrument cluster. The seat of this scooter is very comfortable. The scooter is very powerfull though it is powered by the 125cc engine. It has a very good pickup. You can carry your loads easily. You will not feel any power loss.,Suzuki
"The display is all new too, but comes across as a rather bland effort at bettering the competition. It is rather simplistic in design. The dominant analogue part gives clear indication of speed, the tiny digital display section reads out odometer, fuel gauge, service reminder and two trip meter figures.",Suzuki
"The downside if there was one, would be the seat, even if it's quite plush and comfortable. At 780mm, the seat height isn't quite accessible for riders of all heights, and what compounds matters is the width of the rider seat. So, at a little over 5'9"", I couldn't put my feet flat on the ground at stop lights, so this could be a challenge for some riders. But the new Access 125 also loses weight - a good 10kg at that - over the older model; so it's got better power-to-weight ratio and easy manoeuvrability. At a claimed 64kmpl fuel economy, expect fuel consumption to be in the high 40s or even 50kmpl in the real world.",Suzuki
The drive was very Smooth and powerful Comparatively other vehicles.It's average is little lover Comparatively other other vehicles due tu it's heavy weight.My access is giving 40kmpl milage. If you want a vehicle with power and smooth performance then it's the best vehicle I recommend.,Suzuki
The engine comes with 125 cc of power which is decent and well for indian road condotions but lacks in power .,Suzuki
The engine comes with 125 cc of power which is decent and well for indian road condotions but lacks in power I would say. The pickup of the this scooter is slow. Initially when you try to accelarate it does not go instantly. It gives a sudden jerk after one or two seconds and then accelarates.,Suzuki
"The engine has always started the first time around, even when I hadn't driven it for a week(I always kick-start the vehicle the first time in the morning, as per the advice from the dealer).",Suzuki
"The engine is a 125cc paired with a CVT gearbox, good for an output of 8.5bhp. Which if take notice, is not that puny for a scooter. There is enough torque to pull two full grown adults. The stability and smoothness of the engine is fantastic at speeds above 60kmph.",Suzuki
The engine is located right below the seat storage which causes the storage area to warm up quite a bit even after a short ride.,Suzuki
The engine is more powerfull in new version and the pick up is very good. It achive  42 to 60 kilometre per hour speed in very few seconds.,Suzuki
"The engine is smooth, fuel efficient and starts without any hassles though its advisable to use the kick during coldstarts.",Suzuki
"The engine is so good and smooth even when we reach 80 km/h in highway, there is no vibration and hard sound.",Suzuki
"The engine noise is comparable to Activa when idling. However, it appears to be very low when riding, which is good. As the engine is more powerful(125cc, 8.58hp@7000rpm), the pickup is very good. The brakes are quite ok. For better control, as per the instructions, both the front and the rear brakes have to be applied together. An optional security system is available which(if installed) will be an effective theft deterrent. Along with the optional security system, a remote-start option is also available, but I don't see much utility for that feature. The mileage is between 40-45 kmpl in the city which is comparable with Activa. The detailed specs for the vehicle can be found at https://suzukimotorcycle.co.in/access125_details.asp. Overall, I feel that Access 125 is among one of the best scooters currently available in the Indian market.",Suzuki
"The engine of access is very good it is very powerful and effective as well. The comfortability of acess is also good . It got enough space to keep any in storage box. The millage of acess is very good . It gives you good performance on the city road. Various facilities are also provided by acess 125 like charging facility, proper grip on the road .it is also available in multi color option various colors are listed below 1) red 2) blue 3)white 4) grey. The most effective color of acess is white. It looks awesome in white. The white coating on the surface of the acess makes it more beautiful . So the selling of acessis highest in the Indian market. So concluding It we can Say that acess is a good performer and we should buy suzuki acces 125",Suzuki
The engine of the new Access 125 feels really smooth as the engine now got Suzuki's SEP(Suzuki Eco Performance) technology. It is also a lighter scooter in the 125cc segment which gives it more power. It has a CVT gearbox which feels smooth making it a fun scooter. It can easily touch 90kmph.,Suzuki
The engine of the suzuki access 125 is very good.The acceleration is very good and therefore of constant impulse acceleration the suzuki access starts giving poor performance.,Suzuki
The engine of this bike is in back side so weight in back side is more because of that bike sleep and cause accidents and the tyres are also small which lead to sleep the bike and not prooer greep,Suzuki
The ergonomics on the access is identitical to its previous models.its a very good option probably the best you can get in this price segment of 65000/- and the milege is also good. The showroom mentioned milege is 62 but it gives minimum of 50kmph for me for rough riding in city and about 54 on highway.,Suzuki
The fact is that I have not been regular with service and yet it never ever winked!,Suzuki
"The features which makes this scooty wonderful and more comfortable are , it has telescopic front suspension for excellent ride quality , maintenence free battery , tubless tyres , central locking system, and unique shutter mechanism for a single control point convenience and safety . It is powerred by a 125cc air coolers , 4-stroke engine , Access 125 is enquipped with automatic transmisson for convenience in city riding condition. The automatic garebox works perfectly well for thr access while the scooty weights , just 120kg . It uses 5.6 litres fuel tank while claimed top speed is 92kmph . So if any one wants to buy a scooty then Suzuki access125 is the best choice to buy .",Suzuki
"The first thing & the biggest point that sets access ahead of activa is the mileage.Phew mine has clocked 300kms & its givin me an average of 48, & its still not run in.Compare this to activa & you surely will give activa 5 on a scale of 10.For access my rating is 9 on 10.",Suzuki
"The first thing I noticed which was different from my bike; was the seating position.  I felt that my legs had to be perched slightly higher and a little differently from my usual stance on the bike.   This difference was felt just for a moment and very soon I got used to my new position.  The seat was supremely comfortable and the handlebar, which felt narrow compared to my bike, also gave me a responsive feel.",Suzuki
"The first-generation Access 125 worked well for Suzuki in terms of establishing the company's competency in the scooter segment. Given its rather uninhabited class, the competition was close between its main rival, the Honda Activa 125, and now, possibly from the new Mahindra Gusto 125.The very product design work of every competitor makes them stand out of the crowd. So we chose to ride and review the all new Suzuki Access 125 and see how really it does well on our roads.The all new Suzuki Access 125 REALLY is brand new, almost every bit from chassis to design and engine to improved torque. Suzuki has always brought noticeable difference in every new launch. They surely have understood the like minds of Indian customers. Taking this as an advantage their very new product Access 125 has given the right product by appearance.",Suzuki
"The first-generation Access 125 worked well for Suzuki in terms of establishing the company’s competency in the scooter segment. Given its rather uninhabited class, the competition was close between its main rival, the Honda Activa 125, and now, possibly from the new Mahindra Gusto 125. But Suzuki now wants to better its chances and has giving the Access 125 one serious makeover. After recently riding the new scooter around Pune, we can concur that this one certainly has the potential to head its class.",Suzuki
The front Wheel rim(Wheel disc) is getting corroded at several places. The back wheel disc is perfectly alright. Is it not a proof that one disc is of very poor quality and the other good quality?,Suzuki
The front end of the Suzuki is well weighted and aided by the telescopic suspension,Suzuki
"The front guard was attached to the front wheel dome without any bolts resulted in slipping of that front guard while driving and got struck to the back wheel cracking the front wheel dome on both sides. Entire body of the access 125 was made up of thin fiber of very poor quality. Accessories and other components are very expensive but lacks quality and standard. I recommend, if you wish to have good engine, go for access 125 but you have to allot minimum of 300 INR per month for the maintenance of its parts.",Suzuki
"The front guards(for the indicator lights and front panel) that I bought from the dealer are not designed well. They are ok if a front storage box is not needed. Otherwise, they prevent the front storage box from being installed properly.",Suzuki
The front shocks provide a reasonable amount of cushion while riding on rough roads.,Suzuki
The front suspension is a telescopic bike like suspension. The suspension,Suzuki
"The front suspension is telescopic with anti-dive mechanism, another boon.",Suzuki
The fuel consumption of the scooty is very good the comfort it gives is brilliant the reliablity on the scooty is great thats why the suzuki company launches the nwe version of suzuki access the handling and control of the scooty is not very good but still it is good the of the scooty is very awesome and nwe to get the attraction of the viewers back to the newer version its combi brake system is awesome .,Suzuki
The fuel consumption of this car is not so good it is very bad and the mileage of this scooter is also very low which is a bad problem in this scooter.,Suzuki
"The fuel efficiency is 40 in city limits and 45 highway when speed is maintained between 45 to 60 range with moderate braking. the seat is kind of flat and not having step seating unlike other scooters like activa, deo, pego and mahendra duro.",Suzuki
The fuel efficiency is not sufficient. It gives me 40 to 45 kms/ltr. which is not sufficient.,Suzuki
"The fuel efficiency isn't very good . It promises to give 55kmpl of mileage but it gives a mileage of around 43-44kmpl . For a college student like me , its very tough to manage the petrol expenses . Suspensions are good but other scooty's have better shocks.  Maintaining this bike is another hassle . Every now and then it has to be sent for servicing . My experience with this scooty was not very good and I don't recommend it to anybody .",Suzuki
The fuel tank has a better capacity (6.4 L) compared to other scooters. There is no need to remove the key from the ignition to open the boot. The fuel cap sealing is good as it did not leak after the tank was topped up.,Suzuki
The fuel tank of the scooter has a capacity is very large with compare to other automobile scooter and gives a milage of 67kmpl as the company claims.,Suzuki
The fuel tank of the scooter has a capacity of 6 litres which is good in my terms. And gives a milage of 64kmpl as the company claims.,Suzuki
"The good features which I noticed in my experience with this scooter so far was its amazing pick up, a royal mileage even in city's traffic conditions for a gearless two wheeler, which was about 40 Kms/litre given the condition that I drove in economy speeds of 30-50 km/ph, large dickey space below the seat, a pretty decent sized fuel tank, using the same key hole for opening the dickey storage, key hole guard and lastly the front suspension.",Suzuki
The gradiant ride is also very good and the engine does not give up even in the Hilly areas. The ride is very comfortable due to front hydraulic shockers.  The only concern is the mileage as it gives me Rs. 2 per kilometer but can compromise for comfortable ride.,Suzuki
The grip I got from this vehicle is mind blowing and the pick up of that vehicle has no words to explain.,Suzuki
The grip on road is good but still the grip depends on the quality of tyres.,Suzuki
The griping on the road was good but on the cemented road its sleeps alot and you cannot drive it in the muddy or barren wet land because it is vert heavy from backside.,Suzuki
"The ground clearance is decent too and will get you through most rough patches.The performance for a scooter, as mentioned earlier, is quicker and faster than the what is required. The initial burst of acceleration through the 125cc engine is good enough to excite you. Some extra fat on the Access might mean it has a smooth ride, however the stiff suspension setup makes it slightly bumpy on uneven roads. Overall the package works.",Suzuki
The handling is good and suzuki provides u wide range if colour my favorite red.,Suzuki
The handling of the scooter is very light which is not good in my terms. The scooter should have some weight to make it more handleable.,Suzuki
"The head light is a bit dampner for me, just not bright enough! Also, it dims significantly when you decelerate - becomes real uncomfortable if you are on a badly lit road.",Suzuki
The headlamp uses an ordinary 35 watt bulb. A halogen bulb would probably improve the light quality a bit. I don’t know why but most of the Access 125 scooters have the head lamp focus in such a way that we can see what is on top of the vehicle in front of us!,Suzuki
"The headlight focuses further out on the road which sometimes makes the rider feel that the headlight is not on, especially when there are other vehicles on the road with their lights on. However, this problem can be rectified by the dealer.",Suzuki
The headlight is also good and the best led display is average but when we hit it is greater than 55 kilometre per hour the lower portion of this Scooter  is vibrate and its causes unsuitable riding experience.,Suzuki
"The height of the seating is a bit higher compared to activa, so that makes a little uncomfortable for seating.",Suzuki
The heighted scooter is gud and very controlable but not always for short rider,Suzuki
The indicators pre-installed are of poor quality and you will need to change them after 2-3 months. Also the tires needs to be checked regularly.,Suzuki
"The initial key in use got so worn out that it could be easily removed in on ignition with no option to off the vehicle just in case the key fell somewhere while driving.In such condition vehicle could be started without the key as it was in on ignition.Duplicate key can be made but the magnetic shutter lock mould wont work in that case so was suggested to change the entire lock assembly.Currently using spare key which is working fine.Vehicle is not as silet as it used to be before.The fible parts keep breaking and which add to the expenses, recently changed the handle cover and front fender, the metallic fender is available only in matt finish so had to fit the fibre fender which would again crack in the future.Spare parts are often not available which take a long time to come.Thinking to sell it and buy some other model with good milege.",Suzuki
"The instrument cluster in the all new Access 125 is basic, yet stylish with a small LCD screen that shows trips, fuel level and service reminders. Suzuki has also provided a 12V power socket to charge mobile phones and other stuff. There are two hooks for shopping bags. A full face helmet along with the documents can easily be stored in the under seat space.",Suzuki
"The instrument panel is a simple unit, with a large analog speedometer and a small digital display with read outs for two trip meters, odometer, service interval and a fuel gauge. The multi-function key has ignition, steering lock and remote seat release and overall switchgear quality is quite good. The all-new Access 125 also has a small pocket up front and a couple of hooks to hang your groceries or a bag or two over the floorboard.",Suzuki
"The internal feature of access 125 - engine displacement 124cc, engine type air cooled 4 stroke, no. Of cylider 1, valves per cylinder 2 and auto transmission",Suzuki
The key to get good mileage from the bike is to allow the new bike to adapt and not ride too fast from the beginning.Accelerate to 80 kph mark only after 1st service.,Suzuki
"The large tail lamp unit with a panel of chrome above it looks unique and so do the optional alloy wheels. The Suzuki Access 125 isn’t a scooter that will garner the eyeballs similar to a Vespa but the overall styling is more appealing than its predecessor.The new Suzuki Access 125 gets a semi-digital unit with a digital display for fuel gauge, odometer, service indicator and two trip meters. The seat can be unlocked conveniently through the ignition keyhole which is a good addition.",Suzuki
"The latest access 125 is not that good in looks as per me. but the previous model of access was amazing!  it had choices of colours too. the greyish blue colour was a magnetic colour which draws everyone's attention towards it. it has a good mileage and comfortable seat. people think its heavy, looking at the fat structure but trust me it isnt I have driven it! atleast its weight is  less  than activa. though most of the  people who ride bike choose activa because its very common and people don't see what they like instead they believe the rumours and choose a bike of their choice!",Suzuki
"The light seems to dim if the race goes don, why is it so? I have installed the alarm remote system too, it has given a new touch to the vehicle. Overall the satisfaction is great hope this thing lasts for a long time.",Suzuki
The look and feel of the scooter is very nice I just love the aluminium body of the scooter and other various design enabled over the years is just great fantasticHad brought this beast 10 months ago since then I am in love with this beast this is a great beast. The pickup mileage speed top speed of the scooter is great . The maintenance of the scooter is low and can be afforded by many. The scooter is from Suzuki and hence the maintenance and spare parts are available all at all the places so there is no need to care about after service although the scooter is it costly in the beginning but as you purchase it you will feel that it is worth the price. Very nice scooter I love it and my friends also love with and my family also a bits and everybody loves it and you should love it and hence it is a very nice scooter. You will never regret your decision and you will always want to buy more of the scooter so that you have a collection of the scooters and you just love them. The performance is the scooter is amazing I just love the way the scooter performs on heavy roads Highways and many other roads. For city traffic Disco today's perfect as I love to driver 10 city traffic and I don't care about mileage as the scooter gives me a lot of mileage in city traffic. Also if you want to get it get it to someone then it's a great gift and they will just love it they will just love the scooter and drive it forever for their life and my father also used to drive the scooter and he is very proud to declare that by the scooter son and I have bought the scooter and I just love it I just love it.,Suzuki
The look of the bike is also good. The mopeds always give some classic looks. It is nice.,Suzuki
The look of the new model of the suzuki Access 125 fascinated my brother a lot and therefore he chose the access 125 as his scooter but now my family is disappointed by the decision and performance of this scooter! The main reason for disappointment is that it is too expensive to ride this scooter because it is very uneconomical and gives a very bad mileage!,Suzuki
The look of this scooter is very bad I hated this scooter it shape is not good,Suzuki
The look of this scooty is also not that much fashionable and stylish but its average.,Suzuki
The looks of the scooter are not great as they look old school with curvy designs and not so good in colors scheme.,Suzuki
The looks of this bike is very poor. We can not drive if we are young it looks too odd in the market. My father purchased it for himself but as we know everyone in the house has the right to ride. But literally I prefer walking rather than ride on thi bike. So it is quite comfortable but not up to mark. I am disappointed with this bike.,Suzuki
The looks of this is very different from any other scooter because it has a vintage scooter headlight and arrogant design which makes it very stylish.,Suzuki
"The lord of the fliers the hilfingers and the war machine from japan. good ambiencve easy control very good accoustics and decent platform to entertain ., this suzuki access 125 will definitely be there for a long time and is the real swayamvara for indian roads../",Suzuki
"The main part of attraction was style, good control, engine should and fuel injection. Now just road it for 200km and get 45-50.according",Suzuki
The main problrm I faced is in winters autostart dont work and its keeps on need to start it with kicking. Ut takes too long to start as engine get freeze.,Suzuki
The main thing is that the Customer Service Center Mechanic said to me that this is the Useless Moped and Cheap moped that he will suggest that not to buy this.,Suzuki
The main things of this it's color. The color of this bike is blue which is the symbol of cool things.,Suzuki
"The major highlited was suspension, the front base tyre are higher than the back base by that we can easily handle the moped base with out hand pain.",Suzuki
The matter begins after then the front wheel will begin bouncing and with pillion rider it is too most exceedingly bad. The approved Suzuki administration focus individuals concurs that it is regular in these kind of vehicle as this is telescopic suspension. Besides the clutch  got effectively harmed in a year.,Suzuki
The max speed I had tried is 70. I wasnt very comfortable after that.The wind was really dragging me to,Suzuki
The mechanic charged Rs. 200/- .Surprising I didnt even changed any wires so far. The monthly routine check up I have done regularly is just changed the Engine oil. In city condition I get the around 45+ kmpl but in highway it jumps 55+ .,Suzuki
The mechanics did some engine work for 3-4 days. This engine problem happened even though I have religiously done all my 2000 km services with Suzuki service centre only and not with any roadside mechanic.,Suzuki
"The mechanics keep replacing bearings but the noise persists.I am spending money, but nothing happens. Service is very very poor. Please don`t buy this frustrating bike.",Suzuki
"The milage is around 30 kilometers.  Even after handling it so roughly for nearly 6 years and riding for 1 lakh kilometers ,  the performance of the scooter is still too much to believe",Suzuki
The mileage is also bad. Mileage more than 35 KMPL never achieved where as company claimed more than 50KMPL. Today the ODO reading of my scooty is 45980 KM and I started facing issues from front and rear shockers.,Suzuki
"The mileage is not so good its give 30-35 kilometer per litre but the engine power is good but the problem is the spare parts is not available in market but available in showroom but very costly and the coils are very bad . I had a experience on this scooter and now a days its not in working . the comfort is very nice, the reliability is average, and the handling and control is very smooth and quick its very good and the look is not so bad.",Suzuki
The mileage of the suzuki access 125 is already very low and with time it goes low on efficiency.,Suzuki
The mileage of the vehicle is good.The pick up of the vehicle is also very good.The road grip is also excellent.The front and back look of the vehicle is also good.,Suzuki
The mileage of this Suzuki Get to 125 is around 30 to 35 km for every liter just point I don't care for this substantially less mileage vehicles. So I need propose this vehicle to anybody the street grasp is additionally not great it is not all that agreeable vehicle.,Suzuki
The mileage of this bike 60kml. The clutch is automatic. The schooty suspension is too good. The control of this bike is also too good.,Suzuki
The mileage told by the company is 60 but iam getting less than 40 . But except this and other things are okay and the riding experiences is so good and is easy to use in traffic.,Suzuki
"The mileage was upto 40kmh only. Comfort was good for height people, But it was skidding when we apply breaks suddenly service was also not good, spacing at the front was not sufficient and price is also high when compare to other companies. The service provided by dealer was not upto mark they are not rectifying the defect and handover the bike. The color had been also shaded with in 1 year.The front suspensions are very badly designed being from the Suzuki it's a bad experience lighting dim was not sufficient at nights.",Suzuki
The milege is bit lower than other which does not make alot of difference.,Suzuki
The monthly routine check up I have done regularly is just changed the Engine oil. In city condition I get the around 45+ kmpl but in highway it jumps 55+ .,Suzuki
The most beautiful bike in the world.Suzuki Acess is one of the most popular of its variant. I have may personal experience with it. once I have ride this one for a long distance. I haven't faced any problem while riding this bike. it has good power nearing 9bhp. it has a single cylinde .it is too good.I have not any problem while 3 person sit hear.,Suzuki
The most good looking and good performance non gear bike I have ever seen all the apparatus aur awesome and the looks are also good,Suzuki
The most important feature is that it comes with a bigger wheel base which allows you to feel comparitively less jerks while riding.,Suzuki
The most important thing is almost all the peope can afford to buy this muppet,Suzuki
"The most trending scooter is ""SUZUKI ACCESS"", the best scooter of a families .let's come to its features it has many features compared to old access . The milage of this scooter is well  , fine, good as well as . coming to its comfort its very comfortable too To travel in the cities .we can say that its the best and comfortable scooter for a family which help us to carry a lagages easily . it is contain a stylish shape which will attract us very much . The disk at front gives the stylish and modern look for the scooter . it feels us good by riding the scooter. It as the very much good road grip which does not cause any slippery in the road it prevent us from the slippery .",Suzuki
"The new Access 125 is featured with long foot board and class leading luggage capacity along with long & comfortable seat. The now retro looking Access 125 is very fresh and also comes with optional alloy wheels and disc brakes.The display is all new too, but comes across as a rather bland effort at bettering the competition. It is rather simplistic in design. The dominant analogue part gives clear indication of speed, the tiny digital display section reads out odometer, fuel gauge, service reminder and two trip meter figures.Suzuki has always brought noticeable difference in every new launch. They surely have understood the like minds of Indian customers.",Suzuki
The new Access also has a longer wheelbase than the previous scooter improving stability but not like it was bad in the first place with the older model.,Suzuki
The new Suzuki Access 125 behaves very well in traffic and also on the highways. Suspension setup is neither very firm nor very soft and does their work well on Indian roads. It is a light and compact scooter which makes it easy to control in traffic. The braking isn't that great as it locks up the tyre if there is too much application. Suzuki should use some combi-braking system technology which the Honda Activa have.,Suzuki
"The new Suzuki Access 125 comes up with a lot of new features in it.It gives u a milage of 60 km for long drives and nearly 50-55 on city road.It comes with disks, there is no dash board to it.",Suzuki
"The new Suzuki Access 125 concocts a ton of new elements in it.It gives u a milage of 60 km for lengthy drives and almost 50-55 on city road.It accompanies circles, there is no dash load up to it, A 1lt water bottle holder is given to it rather than dash load up, the gear space under the seat is little than u might suspect, It hs an extraordinary sitting size seat 3 people can openly sit on it.Coming to the pickup as u know the entrance remains for an awesome pickup its pickup is awsome than you think.You will feel flying on it. It has advanced screen that demonstrates the petrol and so on. What's more, has the component of demonstrating a crisis motor oil fill check the new desing of access is adequate to get pulled in by others.the aluminum ring is strong.it is extremely agreeable for riding and taking care of",Suzuki
"The new Suzuki Access 125 gets a semi-digital unit with a digital display for fuel gauge, odometer, service indicator and two trip meters.",Suzuki
"The new Suzuki Access 125 gets more angular lines while the handlebar mounted large headlamp with chrome housing and apron mounted turn indicators give the new scooter a dominating face. Given the fact that the rear panel is swept back, the horizontal exhaust looks weird but the chrome heat shield will be appreciated by most Indian buyers.",Suzuki
The new Suzuki Access 125 has excellent ride quality as it ironed out bumps and undulations with an authority of a third world dictator. This excellent damping endows the new scooter with the best ride quality in the segment. Our test scooter was equipped with the optional front disc brake which hasn’t been launched yet. They do a good job of shedding speeds with nice bite and progression though the rear tyre has the tendency to lock up under heavy braking. The new Suzuki Access 125 is also will swift on its toes and this can be credited to the 103kg kerb weight which makes it the lightest 125cc scooter on sale in India. The weight savings and the 12-inch dia front wheel make it an enthusiastic scooter to ride through the corners and the agile nature is fun as you squeeze your way past the traffic.,Suzuki
"The new Suzuki Access 125 is a good product and one can rely on it, as far as engine breakdown is concerned, at least I've not come across any such instance. Moreover, Suzuki provides extended warranty on Access, which you can confirm from your nearest dealer but according to me its all over good and it also come in front disk break which I like most in this scooty nd also colour is very pretty",Suzuki
"The new Suzuki Access 125 is here to fulfil your wishes.Powered by a 125cc air cooled, 4-stroke engine, Suzuki Access 125 is equipped with automatic transmission for convenience in city riding conditions.",Suzuki
"The new Suzuki Access 125 scooter was attractive at first sight. Suzuki Access 125cc was launched in India in 2007. 9 years after the launch of the scooter for the Indian market and has a good grip. Suzuki scooter in the past few years has been small changes but, for the first time there have been major changes in the scooter.",Suzuki
The new Suzuki Access 125 supports some very good specs and it is a feature full scooter. I am giving a quick overview over the scooter and then my final verdict of whether it is worth or not.,Suzuki
The new Suzuki access has digital petrol meter and new proggramic speedometer. its mileage is round about to 40 45 as it provided with 125cc engine. it has good comfort . seat is now longer than loder model. 12 inch wheel is given. it has also good money value in buy back. but some parts of it made of fibers . it is mixture of fiber and steel body. for two obese people it is good to ride compare to activa.,Suzuki
"The new access 125 is an amalgamation of great style and powerful performance bundled with class leading features. The enjoyment in the ride makes the new access 125 completely unleaveable. The new Access 125 will also be available with an optional front disc brake and alloy wheels. Suzuki provide the easy Start system, multi function instrument cluster with digital display.These features have been incorporated keeping in mind practical usage in real world conditions and the comfort of indian riders.",Suzuki

"The new parameters like mileage, lightweight will made manufacturers should concentrate on the material of the body.to apply such parameters they are making the product with plastic bodies.it couldn't be good for the daily users like me.i just met with a small accident but the bike was totally crashed and it took about 25k for total repair, only because of its fibre body.and mileage is not an issue because it is good in its range",Suzuki
The new scooter in the market from the Suzuki brand is a way awesome having all the feature along with the style in this scooter. The scooter is competing all the others scooter and ofcourse this one is better from all the available scooters in the market as this scooter ha Sathe powerful engine of 125cc which even some bike doesn't have and also the fuel consumption of this scooter is not so high and the bike is comfort and reliable for everyone that everyone can use it. The style and design of this bike is making this scooter different from all the other scooters if tha market. The handling and controlling of this scooter is also very good. The access scooter is choice of everyone. This is competing scooters like activa Jupiter and Many others but this one is what I suggest everyone to buy. Thank you,Suzuki
The new scooter is 90mm longer and 35mm taller than the previous model while the width and ground clearance remain the same. The wide seat is much like the older Access but in a slimmer profile thus retaining the 780mm seat height despite the increase in overall height.,Suzuki
The new suzuki Access 125 is our flagless scooter which combines the best of both worlds - power& mileage,Suzuki

"The new suzuki access 125 is a superb skuty of this time . it's look is amazing as compared to others . I bought this skuty for my father , because the comfert and the milage of the suzuki access 125 is completely impressive . it is comfortable for all the generation . and the skuty gives amazing milage ( 45kms/litre ) . so I luv the suzuki access 125 new model . : )",Suzuki

The new suzuki access 125 is our flagship scooter which combines the best of both world power and milage,Suzuki
The new suzuki access is the competetor of the activa but have the more power and more features. The main big change is the front telescopic suspension which is missing in the honda activa. The telescopic suapension have a great performance on onroad to offroad. The main big change is the front disk brake and this is a safety feature too. The mileage is sufficient according to the 125 cc power. The speedometer is really look great in night travelling and the colors are very aggressive too. When we get the throttle the scooty is actually a beast and the sound produced charge the person to make more and more throttle. People who wabt to buy a new scooty. My advice is go for this BEAST.,Suzuki
"The old model of access was having a power that all of its class scooter could hardly chased it but it lacked in milage, it was giving 30~ 35 kmpl , yes I used it a week and my wallet was drying along the scooter .",Suzuki
The old suzuki access 125 did not have character of its own when we talk about design 125 access never made to the list,Suzuki
The old suzuki access 125 did not have characterof its own when we talk about design.,Suzuki
The older version and the newer versions having lots of differnces,Suzuki
"The on road cost in Bangalore including accessories is Rs.60, 920/- (No Helmet & Body cover) Actual the cost is few 100's less than Activa. The showroom employees are good and does follow-ups and ensures the customer is happy. You won't feel that in Honda showrooms as they are the Kings in scooter market.",Suzuki
"The only disadvantage is its plastic body, so it is not so reliable for long use purpose, but I have this from 3 years now, I never had any problem with my favorite bike.",Suzuki
The only drawback in an otherwise good package are the brakes. It takes some seconds to bring the scooter to a halt which means some planning is required before application.,Suzuki
The only problem I had faced is milage . I'm using it since last 3 years and it is not at all good for long distance traveling . But you can use it in crowded cities,Suzuki
The only problem is its milage but if u need performance then u have to sacrifice this topic,Suzuki
The only problem which I found is that its mileage little less as compared to others. And if you want to go for accessories they give you discount as well. And the best part its body is made of metal and has a glossy touch. Its the vehicle which is best suited for girls and boys both.,Suzuki
The only thing that I don't like about this is that I don't have digital speed meter which is available in other scooters in this range.,Suzuki
"The other trouble which I am facing that some times in the mornings I tried to start with the cick but it never works. I will have to use the button to start. I took the vehicle to the dealer and I have got answer saying that sir, please wait until the first servicing so that all these can be fixed. I think that should be OK.",Suzuki
The overall feedback for this vehicle is good . The performance is good . The pickup is good . The mileage isn't disappointing as well . Their service is also good . The problem I had were that the sound of the indicator stopped after an year and so . The headlights aren't good at all . The need to have a bit range and brighter. Balancing is good. Can attain high speeds.,Suzuki
"The overall quality of the vehicle is very good. The instrumentation is basic, easy to read and that is how it should be for non geared scooters. However the finishing quality of the plastic materials used in the rear view mirrors and the hook is poor.",Suzuki
"The overall silhouette remains the same as the older model, but with the addition of some new design elements; there's a new retro looking headlight with a fat chrome strip around it; the side panels have been redesigned too and there's the addition of a 3D logo as well as a shiny chrome exhaust muffler. The changes are subtle, but they work well and will appeal to a wide range of prospective customers.",Suzuki
"The parts like engine, headlight, indicators are quite vibrant and can be spooted from a long distance.",Suzuki
The passenger is broad and really firm too comfortable enough for a long day riding around the city.,Suzuki
The passenger seat is broad and really firm too comfortable enough for a long day riding around the city.,Suzuki
"The performance for a scooter is pretty good. The initial burst of acceleration due to good torque is good enough to maybe challenge for lead in red light GPs, which means this scooter has the go. 8.5 bhp might not seem much on paper, and they are not much on the road too, but remember the usual crowd has even less.",Suzuki
The performance is really good and the vehicle is really comfortable for daily use. Mileage will be little less than activa. The availability of the vehicle is something important.,Suzuki
"The pick up and the power which suzuki has offered for this scooter is amazing , it really rocks on highway, you really cant monitor your speed you feel like to go higher and higher. There is no vibration or strange noice when you try to overspeed the engine noice is stable at high speed , .so suzuki access is an overall best scooter for both city and for highway journey.The best part which I cam across is the sales after service from suzuki I recieved reminder calls from suzuki service station for servicing my vehicle . and at the service station the technican are very friendly and they listen to the customer problems. They don't have attitude problem which you find at honda service station.",Suzuki
The pick up is really nasty. Even if you accelerate in full it takes ages to reach speeds of 50 kmph.,Suzuki
The pick up is very good as it is a 125 cc bike but as it is a 125 cc bike but it is also good in milege.it gives about 50-55 km per litere. Suspensions are also good.it have an anolog meter speedometer.tyres are of a good quality.it have a mobile chrager in the front of the bike. I think it is a perfect home for a family.,Suzuki
The pickup is also very good. In my opinion it is better than Activa 3g or 4g. If you are looking forward to choose between Activa for ji and Suzuki Access 125 I will suggest you to go for Suzuki Access 125 thanks. ??,Suzuki
The pickup of Suzuki Access 125 is not good the breaking capacity of the scooter is very bad at doesn't have a good grip on the road and the mileage is very bad in the cities it is not made for a long trip this can only be used for our home works and small outings the noise of the scooter is very disturbing and the pickup could have been improved thank you so much for reading my comment and review,Suzuki
The pickup of the this scooter is slow. Initially when you try to accelarate it does not go instantly.,Suzuki
The plastic used is not a good quality which is not in favour of access 125. It has texture which looks feel and chee,Suzuki
"The post GST ex showroom price is Rs 60, 016, the scooter has a displacement of 124cc. it has a power of 8.40bhp, the milage  60 kmpl, fuel tank has a capacity of 5.40 litres, it  has air cooled cooling system, front and rear drum brakes, front suspension is telescopic and the rear suspension is swing arm, for comfort it has pillon grabrail, pillon seat, pillon rest, the scooter has analogue speedometeer.",Suzuki
The premium chrome plating of the head lamp along with bright multi-reflectors ensures long spread of head light to give excellent illumination for safe night riding and leaves a royal impression on road.,Suzuki
The price of the bike is moderate it is not a large I think it is awesome,Suzuki
"The price of the vehicle in Chennai is now RS 51000/- inclusive of everything. Unlike Honda vehicles, where they charge for each of seat cover, saree step, indicator buzzer, floor mats, number plates, hand grips. Here this price includes everything. The tyres are good too, they are MRF Nylogrip. The headlight is a 35 watt halogen, which gives good visibility on the road. They key is very similar to the new Activa, i.e. it is a one key for all the locks, including the under seat compartment. The under seat compartment is bigger compared to Activa (20 ltrs compared to 18 ltrs for Activa).",Suzuki
"The price of this scooter is approximately 56000 thiusand rupees, which is a fair price. If you want to buy a good pickup scooter, then you should definitely take this scooter.",Suzuki
"The price ranges from 57, 000 to 66, 000 depending upon the dealer from whok you are buying.",Suzuki
The principle problrm I confronted is in winters autostart dont work and its continues need to begin it with kicking. Ut takes too long to begin as motor get solidify.,Suzuki
"The product is good. The Engine is most compatible with this size of body. The built quality of its body is good. The look is good. If you want to buy a scooty, buy this. Because it last longer and stronger. People complain about the mileage but in my opinion the performance it provide is worth the little more petrol it consume. And repairing its engine is one drawback. Suzuki should improve it.",Suzuki
"The quality is trust worthy, the whole body is made up of Fiber good enough, vehical is available in different colours and with some special features for new edition vehical.",Suzuki
"The quality of service is also poor. Most of the time they left the problems un attended. The genuine parts, which needed to be replaced, would not be available and at times it took them almost a month to get the parts.",Suzuki
"The quality of the wiring in the scooter is very bad . the battery quality is very bad, not working in rainy season. The starter will give problem and no pick-up.",Suzuki
"The rear grab-rail is a simple pick and refit from the old scooter and I would've much liked Suzuki to have given it the same treatment as the Access 125 SE, an old-school steel unit lashed in chrome and fitting to the neo-retro image that the Access is trying to project. The taillight unit spreads to almost the width of the scooter's rear section and looks appealing.",Suzuki
The rear shocks work well on rough roads and humps only when there is enough weight on the rear wheel(i.e. when another person is riding pillion).,Suzuki
"The reason why access established its market is because honda had created a huge market for automatic scooter with their Activa and Dio, but couldn't actually meet the demand.The demand was so hgh that a customer gad to wait for 6months straight.( Udupi-karnataka)",Suzuki
The reliability is a great one of this bike so one time I am going to chennai on this bike that time this is going very fast that min one car is come to my opposite is wrong then I use brake for very fast at the time to is bike is stop because this bike is give a very good road grip and very best quality Suzuki Access 125. Every time I happy with am a one of the user of this bike and this is not moving on road this is really running on road.,Suzuki
The reliability is less and this was not comfortable compared to others,Suzuki
The ride is stable as well as comfortable. The scooter feels quite sturdy and solid.,Suzuki
The ride quality like suspension is very hard. The suspension hits you even on decent roads.,Suzuki
"The rider seating position is very comfort, The handle bar is precisely placed to be comfortable for people of different height requirements.",Suzuki
"The rider's seating position is so comfy, the handle bar is precisely placed to be comfortable for people of different height requirements.",Suzuki
The road grip of this vehicle is awesome and it grips really use when you find a person on the road suddenly.,Suzuki
"The scooter Suzuki Access is good looking and its design is nice.This scooter is good for ladies and senior citizens are like this scooter.The engine capacity is 125 cc engine is good powerful and 8.58 Bhp @ 7000 Rpm.The scooter is more space for front put in material, water tanks are very use this bike.This scooter is not very strong body.The fuel consumption of the scooter is good and its mileage is 35 to 41 km per liter.This scooter is very good towns and city areas.The road griping of the scooter is good and breaks are good working.The handling and control the car is good and it is good reliability.",Suzuki
"The scooter also have got that new fresh looks to appeal the youth and attracts a lot of eyeballs, many time people confuses it with Vespa because of the chrome headlight trim and mirrors. But now the only issue or the compromise you have to make with this scooter is quality and service. The cost cutting can be seen through the materials used in this scooter and also Suzuki's service is pathetic as compared to its competitions. So this was my review of the scooter. Please hit the like button if you agree or comment down below if you find that something is missing in this review or I am wrong at something.",Suzuki
"The scooter comes with the robust body design & panels. I AM THE PROUD OWNER OF IT TOO. The robust body design provides you a good grip in high speed just like in Vespa,It is also good for highway rides. The ultra comfort seat & the short handle design offer a ultra relaxing ride. Both the tyres are tubeless, so no worry about the punture while traveling to the long distance. It has 6 litres of fuel tank,which is really impressive. It has a boot space of 22 litres, which is enough for a helmet, some books, a jacket & a water bottle,that is really impressive & the best boot space in the scooter segment. IT IS A FULL SIZE SCOOTER. It comes with two hooks one is below the handle & another one below the seat for the grocries etc. It has a push shut lock option. It comes in two variants one is front disc & another one is Drum, but I will recommend you the drum brake because disc brakes are not reliable in scooters as scooters have the small wheel size as as result disc rapidly lockdown the front wheel while braking in result it Skids. Their also a limited edition variant of comes with a BEING HUMAN logo,Leather Seat & chrome finish rear view mirrors, but everything else is same.For the limited edition variant you have to pay approx 4000/- more which is not worth for it . It has the best in class mileage of 64km/litre. Ultra comfort riding position.A very Reliable product from Suzuki. Good handling & control.Sleek & sexy look. 3d Access 125 logo.",Suzuki
The scooter feels very good to sit with appropriate seat height and design and it maintain proper balance while riding. The good part I experience is mileage that is up to expectation. Till now it manages around 45 kmpl that is good enough for 125cc scooter. One should drive it at optimal speed to achieve this mileage performance. Overall the color combination and design graphics are really good by Suzuki and one can surely spend 5-6 thousand extra in order to get some stylish scooter when comparing to Activa or other names.  One can surely go for it without any second thought.,Suzuki
The scooter had stock ceat tyers and they provided sufficient grip for both wet and dry compounded roads.,Suzuki
The scooter had stock ceat tyres and they provided sufficient grip for both wet and dry compounded roads.,Suzuki
"The scooter has a awesome mileage of 50 kmpl in the city area.The price of this scooter is 65, 000/- approximately with estimated GST.",Suzuki
"The scooter has a bunch of features which makes it more desirable than other bikes. The scooter has a Combined braking system with front disc which helps in better control over riding as well as short stopping distances. Combined braking system means one brake is making both front and rear brakes to operate together. Other features include 12 V DC socket, Alloy wheels, central lock system, 21 ltrs of under seat storage space. It has a long and comfortable seat. The tyres are tubeless.",Suzuki
The scooter has stopped in the middle of road and because of it traffic is created.,Suzuki
"The scooter is equipped with useful features like a digital instrument cluster that displays speed, fuel level, and other information clearly. The headlights are bright, ensuring good visibility during night rides. The brakes are effective and provide confident stopping power.",Suzuki
"The scooter is on the portly side, which makes a few other options in this category faster in the initial run, but the extra bit of weight means that it is a good handler. Bad and bumpy roads are well taken care of and corners are dealt with confidence. Overall the package works.",Suzuki
"The scooter is powered with 125cc engine with an ultimate pickup within its series. The overall performance is quite good, but is not that good in the matter of milage I have using this bike since last year and I am satisfied with this bike in the matter of overall performance. I personally refer this bike to everyone, great buy",Suzuki
The scooter is stylish powerful and in par with honda activa.,Suzuki
The scooter is very attractive with its extra fitting as it provides the stylish look for the bike. The headlight is awesome and it gives the rider a modern look. The front portion of the vehicle is streamlined. Thats why the scooter is attractive.,Suzuki
The scooter or cal it moped in pune day to day traffic it handle okay The fuel efficiency of this scooter is gud but the problems its not in continuos effort,Suzuki
"The scooter with it's new digital meter display, chrome fittings in the front looks amazing and eye catchy.",Suzuki
"The scooter with its new digital meter display, chrome fittings in the front looks amazing and eye catchy.",Suzuki
The scooters's equipped with powerful halogen lamps and the electricals are quite robust. But installing the optional indicator beeper should be avoided as it sometimes dislocates the wires of the indicator lights causing it to malfunction.,Suzuki
"The scootret was very appealing at the time of launching.but lack many basic things like poor braking system so cant dare to ride more than 40 kmph, the head light focus is very poor and makes no impact for proper visibilty at night. The seating posture is also not to good and makes you tiring quickly with poor suspensions for indian roads. The average is not more than 35 kmpl.Overall not worth for money",Suzuki
The scooty is available in very cool colours and I can say that suzuki access 125 is real value for money.,Suzuki
"The scooty is good for single riding..with another person the handling becomes really difficult..comfort is average, mileage is average, small problems always pop up..like tyre n clutch piecen the seat cover lock has issues...suzuki service isnt that good either..delay n inconsistent..",Suzuki
The scooty is not worth even trying so guys don't waste your money on this crappy vehicle and go for Activa or TVS Jupiter.,Suzuki
"The scooty is very uncomfortable for the riders, while riding on the road the scooty is very uncomfortable .especially on riding on the hills the scooty will go very slow, compare to other scooty. The company user will say the mileage of the scooty is 64kmpl , but after using it we will notice that the mileage of the scooty will not cross more than 55kmpl, the comfort is also very bad the seating arrangement their is no grip on the seat, when my mom sit on the seat the grip is very less compare to other scooty .",Suzuki
The scooty like activa I have preffered you because it has a good resale value and does not need a high maintaneve like thi one I would life to mention that the body is very damagable as if the scooty is fell down it has a lot of damage which you have to repair it all and it us little costly you should think many times before buying this scooty I would see that it is not a money making scooty and does not provide you with a high comfort level.,Suzuki
The scooty losses pickup and  the milage goes dawn which  can not bw recovered even after serving the scooty. Whereas it comes with a fiber bod which is good for those who need light weight vehicle. Compromising the safty.  Wll not recommended to all to buy 1st take a test drive than oppt,Suzuki
The scooty stops working after every months. 2 batteries have been replaced within 3 months of buying it and the survicing person blams the exide batteries for it,Suzuki
"The seat and the leg space is wide in this scooter. I find this small scooter shape bike very handy and easy to use. The user experience I must say is comfortable for city or domestic use. A good telescopic suspension takes care of the rough roads as well for the bumpers. The handle bars and the seat provide nice ride support. I feel the design has really improved and now thet can easily compete with honda activa, the market leader in scooter.",Suzuki
The seat can be unlocked conveniently through the ignition keyhole which is a good addition. Also the shutter key has a one push central lock system. There’s also a cubby hole next to the choke knob which is deep enough to hold a 1-litre water bottle. Mobile charger is an optional extra and is located next to the cubby hole unlike the under seat option as in rival scooters.,Suzuki
The seat give very nice and realy comfort. And it have reliability tresrstworth and it is.,Suzuki
The seat in the Access is extremly comfortable and robust.It can easily accomodate 2-3 people including driver.,Suzuki
"The seat is detachable using the ignition key hole itself no deperate lock for the seat. the boot space is decent for a big helmet or some small grocessary. . the brakes are drum brakes and bigger compared to its compitators, but emergency braking can not be efficient enough if you are on highway so 70 is safe for highway is traffic is more. overall a nice vehicle suitable for all ages and gender.",Suzuki
"The seat of the Access 125 is wide and comfortable, allowing me to ride for long distances without feeling any discomfort. The seating position is upright, providing good support to my back. Even my pillion rider mentioned that the seat was comfortable.",Suzuki
The seat of the scooty is very comfortable as compare to fasino and other scooty's.,Suzuki
The seat size is also large therefor 3 persons can easily sit on it .,Suzuki
The second flaw which I found in this vehicle was its vibration and sound. My scooter vibrates a lot,Suzuki
"The second incident was with the pollution tube. All of a sudden one fine day, the scooter wasnt getting",Suzuki
"The security feature here is the keyhole cover, which u can slide on the keyhole so that no other key can go inside that too looks very basic, but is very useful. I decided to go with the new launch and I dont regret....   I paid  41750 + 2200 for some base accessories....    Good luck to you all...  if you need any more info.. contact me at mailtoparry@indiatimes.com",Suzuki
The service center is not giving servicing properly very high maintainance scooter not recommended for common midddle class man like me. The quality of the body is very poor.,Suzuki
The service is good and coustemer satification.The reliability of the bike is too good,Suzuki
The service is good and satisfactory no complaint with the service or the reliability of the bike as it is very reliable.,Suzuki
"The service is pathetic. People will make punish you for buying suzuki access.If you are planning to buy suzuki access, means you are planning to buy a vibrator under your butt.",Suzuki
"The service is required for every 3 months. Suzuki's two wheeler service is great. So if you are planning to buy a new scooter, I would suggest you to go for Access over Activa anyday.",Suzuki
The service is very good and satisfactory. No compliant with service. The relibility of the scooty as it is,Suzuki
The service is very good and satisfactory.No complaint with service.The relibility of the scooty as it is very reliable.,Suzuki
The sezuki access 125 is very good looking.It is very shiny and cool.,Suzuki
The shape of the head light is very different than other scooters.,Suzuki
The shock absorbers are good enough for indian roads.provides better suspension than activa.Build quality of suzuki is very good,Suzuki
The sit is very comfortable even for long rides and spongy in comparison to the old access 125.,Suzuki
"The sleek design makes it very comfortable for long drive and the speed it covers is great. Comes in various colour options, you don’t have to restrict your choice to black and white colour only.",Suzuki
The smoothness of old and new access is same as it is and also the pick up is very impressive in moped bikes,Suzuki
"The sound is also smooth and good, also the acceleration is high and can easily reach 90Kmph speed in en empty road.",Suzuki
The spear parts are expensive and this bike requried so maintain. The kick of this bike was poor. The dicky of this bike was less space and no any charging socket is available for mobile phone. The bike is uncomfortable for long distance travel. The bike height is less from ground level.,Suzuki
The speedometer I have one issue on its speedometer that this digital speedometer makes a scooty like a small bycycle of children. If there is no digital speedometer on its than the scooty will be perfect.,Suzuki
"The stock MRF tires were ok for dry roads, and dangerous for wet roads. They seem to be designed for long life rather than for grip.",Suzuki
"The storage space in the scooter is impressive. It has a large under-seat compartment where I can easily store my helmet, and there's still some room left for other small items. It's convenient for carrying groceries or other essentials.",Suzuki
The storage space is just enough for a helmet and documents of the vehicle. I don’t miss the front storage compartment. In fact it provides the necessary leg room for tall people.,Suzuki
"The storage space is very good. Rajeev_Vermacially if you have opted for the front box. The helmet box also is bigger. Combinely, the front foot space & the 2 spaces (front box & under seat) is sufficient enough",Suzuki
"The suspension and the sudden break is also good when compare with other scooters. When talk about mileage, it gives around 35 to 40km/lit only. When you compare with other good features, we can bare the mileage problem. From my point, the value for money when compare with other bikes like activa, aviator, pleasure.",Suzuki
The suspension its very good. There have telescopic suspension. Its very comfortable to easy ride. The suzuki access have 125 cc engine in scooter segments. Have good pickup with good averagein cirty as well as highway running.There have huge storage sapce. And fule tank is 5.6 ltr.Its biggest point to buy this vehicle.. so performance have good as compare to jupiter or activa in average as well as pick up is good to compare 125 cc scooter segments.. to do the love this scooter after have ride..,Suzuki
The suspension needs overhauling as you can strongly feel the bumps on city roads. the handling is okay. if by chance the battery is dead and you need to use the manual kick start then be ready for a good workout as the same is very tough to use.,Suzuki
The suzuki Access 125 is the toughest competitor of Activa3G.As a rider I ride both but I had satisfied with ACCESS125.,Suzuki
"The suzuki Acess 125 is our flag ship scooter with combines the best of both world- powers and milage our revolutionary SEP techonolgy .this is a complete redesign from the ground up both aesthetic -emphazies .The new acces 125 boasts a starty of art sep engine .it have new frame .it also have good brake .it have beautifull weels, suspension .transmmission and body panel The new across 125 ia an amalgamation of great and power full performance bundle with class leading features means foe every one who wants to ride on Suzuki Acess 125 .the enjoyment in the ride gives a lot of pleasures .",Suzuki
The suzuki access 125 I have bought this in this year only it give milleage of 50kmpl thats very good very comfortable it provide large space to user so that carry more item great suspension tube less tyre and very nice grip for safety I bought,Suzuki
The suzuki access 125 gives the average of 45 to 50 KM per liter on highway. Now a days petrol price is going up and up so Its very hard to survive for middle class people to buy the bike or four wheeler which is more fuel efficiency and costly,Suzuki
The suzuki access 125 has peen a popular choice among scooter enthusiasts since its introduction to the market. Suzuki has done an excellent job in designing the access 125 with a blend of elegance and sportiness. the access 125 delivers smooth power delivery and impressive perfomance. The suzuki access 125 continues to impress as a reliable and feature-packed scooter. you have option to choice that.,Suzuki
The suzuki access 125 is a most beautiful scooter in 125 cc mopeds and its raw power gives this scooter a distinct name.,Suzuki
The suzuki access 125 is a scooter manufacture by suzuki motorcycle India limited a subsidiary of Japanese motorcycle company suzuki it was introduce on September 18 /2007,Suzuki
"The suzuki access 125 is a scooty which is ap option for activa and other 125 cc scooty. My father is using it from the last 3 years and I would like to tell u that it is a waste of money and the only thing which is good in it is its comfort . First of all taking about the mileage it is near around 30-35 which is not economical and on coming to the comfort it is the only thing that is good , the problems which are coming are its irregular sound which is due to the varying acceleration which happens itself and also after servising it it is only good for a week or two . The breaks are also not good as there is always a problem with it although the road grip is good and the pickuo is also good but the cons are more and on coming to the appeal it is not beautiful and only can be bought if you want something different so overall it is not a good choice.",Suzuki

The suzuki access 125 is good scooter with and many feature on handle lock key itself u can open sit up and place the things and it sound like you are driving the big gaint troley and it does have the good pickup and if three people sat on the scooter from the back it will bend and you cannot go on high speed because it will slide and you will met with accident and it does not give milage as I expected and as per showroom dealer said because of this I have sell this scooter and buy another and I recomments you to not buy beacuse they are many choices of scooter available in market,Suzuki

"The suzuki access is a good looking, stylish vehicle. Suzuki access 125 is a low maintenan and stylish look, good mileage and faboules colour and this is available in market. So I suggest to every one if any one plan to purchase the scooter or two wheeler. I suggest to all suzuki access is one of the best two wheeler in india. this is better than others and most important think is to his mileage is too good. This is so comfortable for female passenger.its a small swift. Looking is excellent.Friend this is the my experience which im sharing with you.",Suzuki
The suzuki access is a powerful scooter with a 125 cc engine the scooter has a very high pick up.,Suzuki
The suzuki access is a powerful scooter with a 125 cc engine the scooter has a very high pick up.The engine of the suzuki access 125 is very good.The acceleration is very good and therefore of constant impulse acceleration the suzuki access starts giving poor performance.The mileage of the suzuki access 125 is already very low and with time it goes low on efficiency.Not at all good for long ride the engine gets so hot and may lead to breakdown.his is a personal experience and hence is you buy it be ready for high maintenance.,Suzuki
The suzuki access is the suzuki's most selling vehicle. It is powered by the 125CC power mill.,Suzuki
"The suzuki acess 125cc.i bought it in 2009.and till now I am using this scooter.i had the option to choose between hero honda aviator and activa annd suzuki.i chose suzuki acess.because of its appeal, comfort, engine cc, pickup better then other, better boot space and the service provided by suzuki.but the milage was on lower side.currenty it is giving me around 25-27 kmpl.but still I love suzuki acess over other scooters.i also recommended to other family member.in my family itself we have four acess.now in 2017 there is new acess.with two variants.one with disc brakes and alloy wheels and other with normal drum brakes.it is now.25 kgs lighter then previous one.and with more boot space the before.and with better milage.it has the most engine cc as compared to other scooters which gives access more pickup.u can always rely on acess and also the service provided by it.at the end.the sccoter has great balance, stability, lighter in weight.which makes it easier for girls and ladies to ride.i would always recommend acess",Suzuki
The suzuki servicing center guys those who are there are very negligent they missed my battery.. and then after some days they told they found my battery.. and even after one month I have n't received any replacement or new battery for my vehicle.. When I am asking the same to the Suzuki,Suzuki
The swish 125 however is much better than this activa.thank you.,Suzuki
"The swish 125 however is much better than this. Buy, again if you have time and money to waste.",Suzuki
The tail lights focus breaks comfort is good and the most importent thing it is less maintainance which is a very good sign for bike rider,Suzuki
"The telescopic suspension of the first wheel, seating inclination, smothness of throttle, pickup, performance, looks, trusted japanese brand, stability. is nice.",Suzuki
"The things which Suzuki still need to improve is the shock absorbers though they are good as compared to other brands, while single drive you feel the zatkas of potholes but the shock absorbers really works cool with pillion rider. Currently Suzuki provides this with nice MRF tyres, it should be fitter with tubeless tyres (though MRF one is also good)",Suzuki
The tires used in this is tubeless where it gives good road grip and access balances itself a kmph or even below.,Suzuki
The tyres of the bike are of good quality as they dont slip even on wet road and ensure that the rider doesnt fall from it. The bike picks up speed very quickly due to its road grip amd its breaking system is awesome.,Suzuki
The updated 2016 Suzuki Access 125 has received all new lightweight frame and brand new body. The new Access 125 is featured with long foot board and class leading luggage capacity along with long& comfortable seat. The now retro looking Access 125 is very fresh and also comes with optional alloy wheels and disc brakes.,Suzuki
"The updated Access 125 has a lot of room on offer. . To sum it up, the all-new Suzuki Access 125 is lighter, more comfortable, fuel efficient and better looking scooter than its last iteration. At Rs 53, 887 ( ex-showroom Delhi) for the base model, it's also a couple of grand cheaper than the Honda Activa 125.",Suzuki
"The updated access 125 had a great looking and has a lot of room on offer to sum it up all new suzuki access 125 is lighter , fuel efficient , and better looking scooter at lowest price of Rs53, 887( ex-showroom delhi) for the base model , it is also a couple of grand cheaper then the honda activa 125 the suzuki access maintained its position as amoung the highest selling 125cc scooter.",Suzuki
The value of money is little bit high according to the market price but it's ok and can afford it.,Suzuki
The vehicle can touch the speed of 100km/h. This is the 2016 varient and company increased the boot space. And added a mobile charger. It can produce 9nm torque at 5000rpm. The looks of vehicle is good butthe service of suzuki is not prompt. I will suggest you this vechile if you are living in Metro cities.,Suzuki
"The vehicle is Reliable, good Grip, and comfortable. Only the thing which is incorrect as per the advertisement is its mileage.",Suzuki
"The vehicle is good, no doubt. But guys it has serious fuel pump problem. Mine went off after 0ne year and 3200 kms. That too after regular service at authorised service center. And thier customer support is one of the worst. So expect no help from there.",Suzuki
The vehicle is smoother than ever and there are no vibes while starting or driving with this petrol.,Suzuki
"The vehicle is very comfortable, but the main problem is if any ladies sit at the back, the foot rest is the major problem for which a lady at the back cant sit comfortably, the position of the foot rest is not like that in scooty or any other two wheeler for which ladies feel awkward to sit in Suzuki access, else it's a very good vehicle.",Suzuki
"The vehicle is very fragile, it vibrates a lot even while driving at 30 to 40 kmph .The key to turn and open luggage compartment below the seat is horrible. Whenever you start the scooter you have to turn same way hence the compartment opens automatically. Very bad design.(Anytime Honda activa is better in comparison).",Suzuki
The vehicle runs very smoothly especially in traffic its easy to handle and drive too though sometimes I hate the lock system of the seat and petrol.The mileage is also average with 45 kmpl and the maintenance price is also very less.,Suzuki
The vehicle takes a good pickup and is not very much heavy to handle. The ground clearance level is good that on bumpy roads and bumpers it does not touch the ground. The suspensions are good enough to handle such roads. Usually Diki Space is less and key hole is given on side of the vehicle but Access have the key hole at the back and enough diki space to even have a helmet and other things in it.I am getting good mileage from my Access and very happy by the decision to buy it.,Suzuki
"The vehicle was good. There is a lot of space to drive freely. The seat was so length it will be free even 2 or 3 members going on that. Now about the service it was good they are very honest to repair your vehicle and provide a good service to your vehicle. The cost of the Access 125 is around 68, 000 to 71, 000.",Suzuki
The vehicle would start shaking/ the handle trembling when the speed touched 55 -60 kmph.,Suzuki
The very product design work of every competitor makes them stand out of the crowd. So we chose to ride and review the all new Suzuki Access 125 and see how really it does well on our roads.,Suzuki
"The very product design work of every competitor makes them stand out of the crowd. So we chose to ride and review the all new Suzuki Access 125 and see how really it does well on our roads.The comparison game might sound cool speaking about specifications, what is good what is not.",Suzuki

So we chose to ride and review the all new Suzuki Access 125 and see how really it does well on our roads.The comparison game might sound cool speaking about specifications, what is good what is not. But we nee.",Suzuki
"The very worst thing is, Suzuki is not concentrating or controlling their dealer networks properly on how they service their customer's vehicles reliably. Before 3 months, my vehicle got entirely spoiled because of an worst service center(Sujatha Suzuki).  Even one of my friend had the same opinion about Goldfinch motors when he bought a Zeus and then he sold it within a year cursing the service.",Suzuki
The wheel at the front is larger than the back wheel which is good and feels more comfortable.,Suzuki
The wide and long seat is plush and comfortable complemented by the suspension.,Suzuki
The word means it drinks less fuel from other. Suzuki access 125 has a great comfort and a grip. Its seat is longer than any other bikes,Suzuki
"The worst vehicle I have ever got for commuting. Its been just three years and this two wheeler has given me the worst experience of a two wheel drive. First of all, the body of the respective vehicle is all fiber which gets dents very easily. The engine is also weak. I had to get it fixed after every 6 months. Not a good vehicle if you are looking for a two wheel luxury. The mileage this vehicle provides is not good. Although services provided by company is par excellence but what can you really do with all those services if the product itself is a big flop.",Suzuki
The worst vehicle in mordern times. My persnol experinces says that access125 engine is worst it has to be maintain engine per service if not then voice comes and engine is heated to fast in only 20 km the worst mopad and it uses too much of oil in the engine comfort is not good in long journey the mileage average of this vehicle is too bad after 1 or 2 year it give only 25 to 30,Suzuki
"The. engine is butterly smooth and seat offers great comfort . Engine easily starts even at cold climatic conditions , im getting an average mileage of 45-50 in city and 50-54 in highways when ridden constantly at 64kmph-suitable cruising speed for highway . You can corner the roads confidently without fearing loss of grip as company offers you mrf zapper , its matte colour chrome headlamps appeal and look damn beautiful to everyone , . What are you waiting for , just go and get a teat ride and buy , . Hope this review helps you . Be sure to test ride before tou buy . Pocket rocket and pocket friendly vehicle . ??????",Suzuki
"Their are many scooter available in the market to compete with this, this is not soo good or not a big seller.",Suzuki
Their new model was also launched and it was fabulous also in look and feel . If you looking for the milestone and average than also it is good product .I want to suggest you that it is very good if you buy this product,Suzuki
Then I bought suzuki access it was so fine but at the time of purchasing we were confused either to buy another activa or access but after purchasing access we realised that it is far far better than any other two wheeler.,Suzuki
"Then I called to service centre and told them all the issues regarding this scooty. They said to bring scooty at service centre and I did the same. After then they asked me to service the scooty and they charged the battery and billed me around 2000 rs. Then again within 1 month same issue begins. Then again I called at the service centre they asked to bring scooty again and I did the same, then after checking scooty they said the scooty battery has gone and it should be replaced, After listening this I got really shocked that within 6 months battery got dead.",Suzuki
Then I purchased the Access. The look itself floored me. Then I took a test drive. Mine heart immediately said that boy this is the one I am looking for. Now what I liked about the Access.,Suzuki
"Then access 125 is suzuki motorcycle india's first year performer in the rapidly growing automatic scooter  segment. A peppy engine, universally acceptable looks ad decent fuel economy got it quite a fan.",Suzuki
Then comes performance: The feel when you ride this vehicle is fantastic. Engine run like butter.,Suzuki
"Then if you compare between activa and access its hard to choose as both wins in there own category, like as per my thinking, in looks activa wins by just 2 points like 51-49 and then in price both are same, activa has some new advanced features like tuff up tube and disc brake & combi brake.",Suzuki
Then in this bike the cornering is too dangerous because it wont bend much and it does not have a body balance.,Suzuki
Then on I've not given it for service regularly. I'm getting a average mileage of 40kmpl. I've used it for long distances (15km/22km) to and fro and it is good in the performance. main thing is to maintain it in the initial first year after u buy it.,Suzuki
Then one more person attended me & gave the estimate of Rs 200 for service. Evening I received call from Satya that they are about replace the break drum & break shoe which I have never requested & bill overshoot Rs 2000. I asked the reason for replacing this he is mentioning my vehicle as run more than 20K kilometer which is not true.,Suzuki
Then vehicle used for 6/7 month with no issues.all routine services done with respective km directed.,Suzuki
Then vehicle used for while again same issue occurred then i replaced the relay (that black part),Suzuki
"Then what did they done on that service time even I told to tune the mileage. ""They done that , they tune the mileage from 35 km/l to 28 to 30 km/l"". What a great job. Today I leave the vehicle into service center as per their advice, at the time the technician asked me that what is the mileage now , I told them 28 to 30 km/l. and asked him what is the maximum mileage this  vehicle can give, I was surprised that he told me that vehicle can give only 35 km/l on road against the available details in the Suzuki Co. website says 52 km/l.",Suzuki
There also in india lanch the scooty atmosphere brightnes is super this bike.,Suzuki
There are at least 100 people standing in a Queue to five the vehicle for free servicing & you have to waste at least 3 hours in a queue. Service centre is closed on Sundays .How one can afford to waste 3 hours on a working day just to give the vehicle for free servicing?,Suzuki
There are few worthy points I have come to know from reading the scooter manual and would like to share them with you:,Suzuki
"There are gaps between the chrome head light surround and the actual sealed beam, ditto indicators and apron but they’re only visible up close and in nitpick mode.The overall scooter belies my styling-related apprehensions which were probably caused by the Auto Expo model being shown on stage, placing the scooter above eye level. Now it seems to present a polished picture and I really do like the chrome surround on the headlight.",Suzuki
"There are lots of bikes dont go for this reason if you thing this looks good, only the look is the icest thing about this.",Suzuki
"There are many  Problems as are - Noisy Engine, Mileage in city is only 30-35 km/liter, which is very low as considered petrol price now.",Suzuki
There are many differnt brands of bike in india which are available in market . when it comes to scooter there are multiple number of scooter's available in indain market . most of the scooter in india is of 110 cc not more than that .,Suzuki
"There are many reviews about Suzuki Access however, till now no review about new Honda Aviator 110 cc. Looking forward to family bike so my wife can also drive without any problem. Also looking for better mileage and as per reviews, Suzuki Access has avg mileage of 40-42 Km/l.",Suzuki
There are many things about this I can tell but time is very exepensive so good bye and oviesly buy this product.,Suzuki
"There are no surprises when you thumb the starter; the engine settles into a reassuring hum and the scooter pulls cleanly, accelerating without any sense of feeling strained or without any vibrations creeping in. The engine is a new one - with SEP technology or Suzuki Eco Performance, which reduces friction among the moving parts and is also said to improve fuel economy. The overall displacement remains the same at 124cc, and makes the same amount of power - 8.58bhp at 7, 000rpm. But it makes marginally more torque now - 10.2Nm at 5000rpm.",Suzuki

"There are several times when scooter has stopped in middle of the road and other vehicles almost have come and about to hit me from behind. This is Safety issue. I have shown to service center several times however there is no solution. Today because of this engine switch off issue, my 2.5 years kid fell down, I am very upset. It was big mistake to buy Access 125. Do not every buy Access 125 scooter, they are cheats. Safety and security is big issue. Second problem is very poor mileage of 10 km initially and now it is 20 km, service center says this happens because it is new scooter, however its has being over 6 months, still mileage is about 20 km which is really poor.",Suzuki
"There are so many positive things about this vehicle, which you have completely ignored.",Suzuki
There is a noise coming out from the engine as u cross 50-55kmph(might be common with other 2-wheers also).,Suzuki
There is a problem of using it on off road that it gives too much jerk so riding offroad is quite difficult by this scooty.,Suzuki
"There is a provision provided to fix a switch in the right hand side (near throttle) of the Suzuki Access 125. I got fixed Honda Activa headlight on-off switch (cost Rs. 60/-) with slight wiring. Now as soon as I start my vehicle, the front parking lights glow (at headlight off position) thus complying with BS 4 standards. And I can switch on & off my vehicle headlight at my wish.",Suzuki
There is have a smartest features for the bike so this is really comfort for any situation this is using material for production is really good valuable materials. Fuel tank capacity is 5.6 L this based your traveling distance is expended. So your can enjoy with is bike and this is a very long life bike. in the bike is haven one person that person is clearly going and comes is very safety. this is haven disc brake and very good battery and very good design. Really this is attracting for peoples for when your driving this bike on road.,Suzuki
"There is no beeper connected with right-left turning signals, so it remains 'On' even after turn, drive has to care for making it in normal state.",Suzuki
There is no issue in comfort of driving. Handling and control becomes difficult when not on paved roads. It kind of slips a lot during rainy season. I fell once from this scooter along with my friend due to this.,Suzuki
There is no other scooter to surpass the Suzuki Access 125. Its performance is a . one and a half level because I have an Access 125 full edition matblack in my hand which I have been using for about 2 years. The performance of its suspension is what makes it so comfortable to ride on. The small problem with this scooter is that it is a bit of a risk to get started ? If you press yourself it will not start at a single stroke and the accelerator must be supported. Then Ivan was getting 60-70km mileage since the mileage was lowered and now it has come down to 55-65km which happened after 12000km. Yet I have faith that the owner will not be deceived,Suzuki
"There is no vibration or protest from the engine, even at high speeds.",Suzuki
"There is one thing that bugs me about this scooter. Everytime you shut off the engine, there is this strange kind of ""knocking"" sound you hear. I thought it was a defect, but the dealer said it is because of the decompression valve and its with all of them. I'm not sure if I should buy that story - because I've never heard such a sound in any other scooter before but then I verified with couple of other owners and they confirmed that they too get that sound. However, the scooter hasn't given me any trouble because of that but then again that sound is definetly not pleasant to the ear.",Suzuki
There was a problem in engine's head its give me more anger for this bike.after using 1 and half year of using this scooter I sold it in just 35000 Rs.,Suzuki
"These scooter are made on the high chassis under high rigidity which is considered to be a very luxurious chassis technology and telescopic suspension used in the front suspension of this scooter, while the use of swing arm type suspension technology in rear suspension. And the seat of this scooter is also quite wide, so that 3 people can easily sit and walk around it. This scooter comfort level is very high.",Suzuki
"They CHEAT the customers by charging them for service/oil change etc., but does none of these . Do not buy this piece of UNRELIABLE stuff. Even complaints on Suzuki official site has fallen onn deaf ears. Have spent about 20K so far on this",Suzuki
They are feel comfirt the Suzuki Access 125. Its very long mileage in 1 litter petrol. Easy handling the bike. I also like to ride on Suzuki Access125,Suzuki
They changed the seat of my moped with someone else's which was all torn and didn't provide me a new or the old one to this day.,Suzuki
"They didn't take Bank pass book or company HR letter(which ur working in)as address proof, as per RTO rules, u can either go for making affidavit for Address proof, they offered it for Rs400.",Suzuki
"They don't bother about to put back some important pares like screws, nuts bolts etc.with this you can understand, for what good reason we should go with Suzuki except Brand.",Suzuki
They just bill you and return the vehicle as such. good water wash and polish your service is done.,Suzuki
"They said to me servicing will get over in 45 minutes, I can wait 45 minutes. Even after 45 minutes they have not started, I literally ran behind them to complete the servicing, and then they completed  servicing @ 6PM. My Vehicle reading was 10064, when I saw during the delivery it was 10073, when I asked them about the same they don’t have answer. Also seat cover lock was not proper, I am not able close it properly they were not accepting it, I believe it would have caused because forcibly opening without key, I don’t know whether my assumption is correct.",Suzuki
They should put some more punch in the battery . Some more Amp-hr I think.,Suzuki
They told that the access gives 65km average but its not so far.,Suzuki
"Thirdly, there is no manager or superior available most of the time for communication and for checking the status of the vehicle.- When ever I tried to check the status of my booked vehicle their was no one available whom I can get in touch with. Every time they asked me to call some other time. During booking we had interaction with Chetan Doshi (Manager) and later when we tried to contact him, he didn’t answer our calls properly and usually end our call abruptly.",Suzuki
This 125cc scooter is the most powerfull scooter one of the fastest scooters in india.125 model is of 2015 and I like it's sound.but there some problem this Suzuki access 125.p problem is verry poor mileage.i am still disappointing because of verry poor quality of material utillizing in to the scooter for example when my scooter fall down on the stand.Handling control is verry smooth & verry nice.breaking system could be better.but feel the scooter battery is not that good.but looking is good & stylish scooter.,Suzuki
This Access 2021 model in best model and this model added new features in this latest access model . Access 125 bike is currently top bike in moped category.,Suzuki
"This a better ride than the options available in the market now among non-gear vehicles, its acceleration matches many bikes in market and even better than many of them... its mileage is also really good. It is a awesome ride for those guys who only have city work and a little bit more, so in my view I can recommend this product to my friends and family too.",Suzuki
This bike Access 125 is a great and stylish looking bike. It gives a mileage of 55kmpl in city and in highways it gives a mileage of 60kmpl. It has a great comfort on city traffic as well as in highway rides in which our body doesnt feel tired soon. Its reliability and road grip is so good that we feel like as we are driving a car. It has a four stroke engine which has a torque of 5000 rpm. It has a telescopic suspension too which gives more comfort while driving in city roads. In short this bike is good and really comfortable to have a ride.,Suzuki

This bike gives the mileage in and average of 55 to 60 kilometres per outer this is the better mileage,Suzuki
This bike gives you worst expereince of self start problem and batteries will get damaged every 6 months. You need to spent a lot of money on this bike and maintenance. Not good elders when having frequent self start problem,Suzuki
This bike has a very good and sudden pick up and also its moves very smoothly in running.,Suzuki
This bike has good grip on roads and has good brakes too (Handling and Control). Looks wise also it is better than Activa. If you see new activa they have copied Access. Actually I booked Activa but last moment cancelled my decision and went for Suzuki access 125.,Suzuki
This bike has many features like selfstart huge space to carry laguage and big headlight,Suzuki
This bike has small seat which reduces the comfortness in the bike and the look of this bike is also not that good .,Suzuki

This bike or scooty from suzuki access is one of the most selling scooty from suzuki. Still it is going very good. Look of the scooty is so sleek and genuine quality. Engine is of 125 cc which gives it enormous power for great pickup. It is giving me mileage of 40 kmpl easily. Braking of access is so powerful and does not let you slip even on sudden brakings. Suspension is so smooth which does not let you feel bumps on harsh roads. Stability of scooty on roads is too good does not get slips easily. Handle bar feels so light which makes it so easy and comfortable for you to have the tight grip even at sharper curves. Have 125 cc engine and still feels light and comfortable to handle.,Suzuki

This bike used for FRONT POCKET AND STEEL BODY AND STEEL FENDER. Exsubect Mobile Charger Dc Socket. Coming to the ride and handling. the Access fell more stable than most other scooters owing primarily to the slightly higher weight and the longer wheelbase.The front end was well weighted and aided by the telescopic suspension .Handing was very stable and confidence inspiring. I rode the Access extensively in Goa for thee days and I could happily cruise at 70 all day. There was sufficient power available at all speeds. quite unlike the 110cc scooters which felt like under powered after 60kph.I Can say this as the bike which I rented was a relatively new bike with only 6000kms on the odo.

This implies theres a squarish separate key space adjoining primary key opening. One needs to embed a given specifc enter in this squarish key space and swing it to work the screen which is a flap(metallic) that covers the principle key gap. The rationale here is one(children) can't tinker with the holes(insert sticks and so on… inside) once screen is worked. Down to earth thought at that. I couldn't oversee all the more then 60 KMPH so cannot remark on top speed and I as a rule don't pass by companys figure. The same is consistent with efficiency. I think it ought to be between 40 to 45 KMPL on genuine condition however the organization claims 60 KMPL.,Suzuki

This means theres a squarish separate key slot adjacent to main key slot. One needs to insert a given specifc key in this squarish key slot and turn it to operate the shutter which is a flap(metallic) that covers the main key hole. The logic here is one(children) cannot fiddle with the holes(insert sticks etc… inside) once shutter is operated. Practical thought at that. I couldn’t manage more then 60 KMPH so cant comment on top speed and I usually don’t go by companys figure. The same is true to fuel economy. I think it should be between 40 to 45 KMPL on real life condition though the company claims 60 KMPL.,Suzuki

The scooter was first purchased for my uncle and the reason for purchasing this scooter was the negative attitude of the Honda dealers (even though the products are excellent).

Then, when the time to purchase a two wheeler for my wife, we did not have to think twice to finalize the same brand. A white colour was purchased as ours was one of the first bookings for white.

"This scooter is owsome. Nice power nice pick up all over the bike is too good. And its look like a vespa scooters. My friend ankit have suzuki access 125 blue colour. Compony gave charger option, disk break crome platted mirror ect.",Suzuki
"This scooter is the awsome scooter that I ever see in my life, it has good pickup than others scooters and high speed than others, looks is so greatly, mainly it is made more nicely of our expectation and in order of comfort its asome",Suzuki
This scooter is very good in towns and city areas . The rood griping of the scooter is good and break are good,Suzuki
This scooter offer a good milage of around 50 km per liter which is good as compared to others . Suzuki access is also a low maintenance vehicle and can be easily used by every member of the family . The cabin or boot space is also good to put our items in it. So overall its a good value for money,Suzuki
This scooter pick up is very good .Good speed and pulling capacity. This scooter available in many colours,Suzuki
This scooter that is the suzuki access 125 is an amazing scooter. It is available in different-different colours with a very powerful engine of 125 cc. But I did not find the latest version so fantastic. I mean if you want purchase then the older one is going to be a better option to buy. All over a perfect one,Suzuki
This scooty bike is good choice for me and it never disappointed me.,Suzuki
This scooty comes in price range of 71000 which is a higher side but it have a lots of features too get this scooty.,Suzuki
This scooty dont have a well road grip. It even get slip in little bit wet road.,Suzuki
This scooty gives good milage. Have capacitive storage. Good engine . Milage is going good till now .,Suzuki
This scooty have 125 powerfull engine who produces 9 bhp of power and 11 nm of touque which good inuf .its lightweight too cause this scooty have 101 kg weight. The mileage of this scooty is around 45kmpl. Fuel capacity of this scooty is 5.8ltr. This scooty have all new refreshing style.handling of this scooty is very good I like the performance of this scooty very much. It have combo braking system which is good too and tubeless tyres also.its have space too for placing things on it.its value of money.Atleast take a testdrive when purchasing scooty then make a decision about that.,Suzuki
"This scooty is best for family member in short distance, not for long distance.",Suzuki
This scooty is not for the people having short height. It's pretty large and weight Upto 102kgs. Have metal in its front mud guard. Seats are quite comfortable. Headlamps are not so bright. It have good top speed. It has 1 cylinder. Mileage is 50 to 60kmph as an average speed. But the top speed is 102kmph. Not much maintenance is needed other than engine oil change. It can carry 3 persons of weight. Long seat. Good break and good looks. Large under seat storage. Mobile charger in front. But it has sometimes problem is self start. Little bit problem for short people.,Suzuki
"This scooty is not like the others which gets down in performance when riding in mountains and I am from uttarakhand and I ride on it daily and it gives a very good milege as compared to others and in plain areas( cities) , it gives a very best performance and its a very comfort scooty and its breaking performance is also very good as many times I got save from accidents and all the credit goes to this scooty break performance.",Suzuki
This scooty is suitable for the person who highted.comparing with activa it is big.I used blue coloured one.I got mileage of 50-55km. Only the maintenance needed after six months changing the engine oil.i am very comfortable with this scooty.it has large under seat storage.sometimes problems coming in self start.And it as more leg space and also can keep lagages on that space.it valued of money 60-70k.,Suzuki
This scooty is very good for learners . this is the best way to get learn scooty for girsl specially .the fuel consumption is good . average of this scoory is also good .,Suzuki
This scooty is when I buy this is the best one I thought but after some time later this scooty is the break problems and the accelerator problem and the mileage is tooo bad.,Suzuki
This scooty is worth buying because rather than other scooties access gives a lot better mileage. The looks are really good. It comes in 3 different variants and the top model provides you the disk break. The front and rear shock absorbers are working great. The pickup of this scooty is far better than other scooties. This is very fuel efficient,Suzuki
"This scooty makes you feel like a bike.It is very styly lookable one.And coming to its specifications -It has tube less tyres. -digital speedometer. -round mirrors. -disk brakes. -good mielage a bout 64 avg. -light system is also very very good and also too bright.Recently my friend bought it, and its running very well and we should definatly not have any problems with this bike.So my advice is to buy this scooty.Now a day all are eagerly waiting for stylish scooties.This is exactly that one which fulfil your dream",Suzuki
This scooty may give a real life average mileage of 55-60kmpl but over time the scooty quality degenerates and also the suspension stiffens and the body panels are almst paper like and if even damaged a bit need replacement because envem the slightest damage is irreversible. After a period of time the mileage drops from 55 to 35 kmpl. The scooty being very comfortable has lost a lot of points on style. Road grip isnt very bad for its segment but that doesnt mean it's very good either. There are many other bikes in the segment with bettr qualities.,Suzuki
This scooty pickup is very good and very interested in the position of breaking system.,Suzuki
"This scooty was bought by my sister 4 years ago. Still now it works very smoothly. If serviced regularly then it works very smoothly and remains as new only. If we take care of this bike there is nothing to worry, it depends on us how we use it. If we do not take care of it then also it will not go for extreme bad condition. It is a very light vehicle. It cannot go for more speed .",Suzuki
This shows how simple the handling of this bike is. Till now I had driven this for more than 600 Kms the only problem I faced till now is the buzzer of side indicator has been lost when I had drove this through very uneven road for which the show room people had replaced it free of cost.,Suzuki
This suzuki access 125 is a affordable scooter. And this scooter Give a very good milage and the scooter mantainance is very low. Personal ly I like this scooter for milage and performance.,Suzuki
This time I took my friend along with me because it was hard to find SUZUKI showroom. The staff was over friendly which surprised me for starters. Then talking to them for longer time made me realize they were not at all professionally serious about my concern on test drive. I took the test drive but not satisfied with the ride quality and left the showroom with another disappointment. 2 days after I met my friend who recently purchased access 125. He was very happy with his scooters and forced me to once again go to showroom and git it try. I drive his access and it was very comfortable and great pich-up among all the other scooters I ever tried. At that moment my I realize my search is over and I bought Access 125 Z edition.,Suzuki
This vehical is very good proudect by suzuki.very good model suzuki Acess 125 .This vehical is good other vehical.l ike this product.,Suzuki
"This vehicle has got a massive performance and the pickup is awesome, handling of the vehicle is too smooth.",Suzuki
"This vehicle is good from my side fuel consumption is is also fine, at the level of comfort I will give full 10/10 marks",Suzuki
This vehicle is mainly used by the student to travel the small,Suzuki
"This vehicle is no good, I bought it as Activa had a lead time. I don't know how many people wrote positive reviews, but go to the service centre all the customers are unhappy. Buying Activa now. Wasted money on this. Why should I write 250 words I really do the understand.",Suzuki
This vehicle is very attractive and had best of engineering .the best part is its boot space and acceleration which is too good .,Suzuki
This vehicle is very bad to use.Tha suzuki Access 125 variennt has low colours.its maximum speed is 78 .the other vehicles have 98 and above.this is very bad and there is no more control to drive.the front have no space for our legs .There is only low space and it has no sidestand.tjis is very Slowvehicle.The company didnt get any profit from this vehicle.the scooter is not a good model and it has less weight.the tyres ar3 very bad.the brake systems the engine power is very low .The performance is very Low.,Suzuki
This vehicle rocks with 125c of engine capacity that doesen't get load on engine performance while riding on hills.engine is air cooled and 4-stroke which causes less pollution& more fuel efficiency.The milage of this bike is 55-60 which is on striked by company.But it doesn't give that much of milage at all.In practicle efficiency is about 45km/litre.,Suzuki
This was damaging my life because I am a very poor person and I cant sell the vehicle nor I can again invest money on that.,Suzuki
"This wonderful blend of power and style will surely leave you surprised.Access 125 is equipped with many other attractive features such as telescopic front suspension for excellent ride quality, Maintenance Free battery, tubeless tyres, central locking system & unique shutter mechanism for a single control point convenience & safety.",Suzuki
"Though I was keen to purchase a new scooter from this class, I pretended as if I have no interest & made my family convinced for buying one on the pretext of the new one can be used by my wife for school/bazar duty etc . Chose a sky blue colour among the avaliable ones ( black, greyish black). Delivery was made within two days. The entire process was very smooth.",Suzuki
Though majority of the market looks at mileage driven scooters there has been slight improvement in powerful 125cc scooters. Suzuki has recently unveiled brand new Access 125 which will replace the previous gen Access. Let us see how the new vehicle goes head on with Activa 125 and Vespa 125.,Suzuki
"Though my Access has clocked only 750 km so far mostly in city only, what I feel is I am getting around 35-40 km per lit.",Suzuki
Though service center people claims it is becoz of adultered fuel Can that be right becoz I am pretty sure I had fueled it from most reputed petrol bunks in the city?,Suzuki
"Though the service centres are less & mileage committed by sales person was 40 - 43, I went ahead in purchasing. Access performance is too good while riding with a pillion & riding in elevated bridge & even some bikes lacks power in elevation. This clearly showcase the power of the engine.",Suzuki
"Thought of buying an Activa.. After comparing the features of Access with Activa, I changed my mind.. and yeah all of us want value for our money :) The on Road price of Activa and Access didn’t vary much. I purchased Access for Rs. 47800 (On Road).. and shelled out Rs.400 more for minimal Accessories. I will definitely recommend this to any one who is looking for a 2 wheeler with value for money.. I am enjoying the Joy Ride from my office to home!! Truly a Master Piece from Suzuki... Way to go!",Suzuki
Thumbs up from me.i would recommend people to buy this scooty bike.,Suzuki
"Till date I have not faced any problem, and its mileage is close to 50 in Mumbai traffic. It has more power than Activa and has great looks too. I will call it stupidity to wait for ACTIVA when ACCESS 125 IS readily available.",Suzuki
"Till now I am happy with my scooter. I wll keep on adding my experiences.Does any body know how to read its fuel meter. I mean when it comes to the lowest block above emptly, hw much petrol still remains in tanl and when its on the bottomline of the lowest block but above 'E' (empty), how much petrol remains in petrol tank.",Suzuki
"Till now I am very happy with the performance of the scooter. It was wise decision to purchase the access. My daily running is 52 km of which 10 km is in city and 42 km is on highway. It gives the mileage of 45-46 km/Lt. Which I find it good for 125cc gearless scooter. The design and looks are quite sporty. This scooter really has the power, just slight raise and it vroom’s, initially the engine noise relatively audible but as you move on the road and speed increases the voices just disappear then it is the voice of wind, the scooter is really smooth on the highways, it is damn steady I have drove it a the speed of 70km/hour and it runs as smoothly as makkhan, no vibrations no noise. This is the maximum speed the scooter is not able to cross 70.",Suzuki
Till now I didn't experience any problems other than some starting trouble. But that too is okay for me as I am experiencing starting troubles only after if I am not using/starting the vehicle for 4-5 days. Maintenance cost is also very less.,Suzuki
Till now I got only one service. When I taken to second service they taken my receipt of second service. But service didn’t happen?,Suzuki
"Till now I have driven 10, 000 kms and haven't faced any problems in body line or in Engine.",Suzuki
"Till now over all, I feel very confortable riding this scooter with a very good power. Probably they should have been taken care more on the breakes as it is little difficult to break after 40 kmph.",Suzuki
Till now which ever non gear two wheeler I have riden Access 125 is the best one. It has 125 CC and good breaking. I like to suggest you to buy disk one. The trunk has more space. Long seat. It is really good two wheeler. The company says that it gives 64 millage. But approximately I get around 60. The parts are less costlier than other scooters.,Suzuki
"Till the date from Bhojanna Suzuki service Horamavu, banglore",Suzuki
"Till today I have no problem with it..i have journed 540 KM till now, and I am surprised with its milage.",Suzuki

"To date I don't understand why Indians continue to buy the Honda Activa in large number! It is an outdated scooter and has inferior features compared to other contemporary scooters. The primary reason I can attribute to it's huge sales is HERD MENTALITY! Most people think that since it sells vastly, it is a superior product but in reality it isn't! There is also the resale value which is a factor. But the Activa's superior resale value is the result of this very herd mentality! Personally, I say the Access is miles ahead in every department compared to the Activa. It's only on the availability of service network, Honda is ahead of Suzuki but I see this changing as I have seen an increment in Suzuki service centres of late.",Suzuki
"To drive situation. The style , colour and power. No complaints about it. The main part of control over the bike.",Suzuki
To me its the best in non gears The comfort I get using it cant be beaten by others sorry'activa' you aint active,Suzuki
"To short the problem. He sorted it by wasting my half day again. But now another problem i got after 3 days that was sound of clutch . Again i approach them with full of anger and asked to manager. Again they asked for one day and called me afet 400 kilometer. I gave my vehicle again there but they was not able to get the vehicle original sound. I approach another suzuki dealer and ask for that, he took half day and short hte problem bt charger 500bucks.",Suzuki
"To sum it up, the all-new Suzuki Access 125 is lighter, more comfortable, fuel efficient and better looking scooter than its last iteration. At Rs 53, 887 ( ex-showroom Delhi) for the base model, it's also a couple of grand cheaper than the Honda Activa 125. While price for the disk brake variant is yet to be announced, we’re sure that it will undercut the Honda on price once more. It’s seriously very hard to find fault with this one. Honda better roll up its sleeves, because definitely it’s on now.",Suzuki
"Today I am going to review Suzuki access 125 which we had bought 2 years back for my father from nearby dealer. We had test drive many scooty like activa, jupiter and all, but still we found this scooty more reliable.",Suzuki
"Today I am goining to share my personal experience with Suzuki Access 125. Firstly I am very disappointed with the mileage it give me only 30 km/L mileage after 2 years which is very bad thing. The engine is made up of Japanese technology so it need lots of maintenance. Comfort of the scooty is good. Road grip of the road is also good. It have 125cc engine but then also after 3, 4 years the pickup decrease. The new model does not have any appeal.",Suzuki
Today I am here to share my survey about Suzuki Get to 125. The looks are alright and it accompanies a tubeless tires. There is no manual sign by any means. The cost of this Suzuki Get to 125 is almost around 62000 in the showroom cost and I feel that the cost is too high nearly to alternate organizations. The support cost is additionally high.,Suzuki
Today I give my review about the Suzuki 125 I I think it is a awesome bike for the random use it is good for the teenagers and for the women's,Suzuki
Today I share my personal reviews regarding this product So you will take a correct decision.,Suzuki

Maybe we'll be here before you would choose best baking and budget. First time in to talk about style and design of this Suzuki Access 125 it is not very good it is average I will give 2 stars to style and design of this suzuki 125.

"Today I write Review of my scooter ""Suzuki Access 125"", which I brought it in 2018, it is best scooter or bike my experience good about this scooter it give me about 53 kmpl average on petrol so it's this decent average don't expect more than 53 it will give more average on highway up to 60 kmpl.",Suzuki
"Today again i have been told a new policy of suzuki access, wherein you are not allowed to claim free service given by the company if you missed the date of service given by the service center.",Suzuki
"Today is 07-Dec-2009 and Access has crossed 10, 000 kms. Crossing this mark from earlier mentioned has taken a long time.",Suzuki
"Today morning i.e 10-02-2014, I went to service center. Along with me there was one person, when we were in queue one lady came with vehicle. The person who is in charge of taking the vehicle, left us went to address the ladies vehicle problem first.",Suzuki
"Today scooter has regained its lost glory considering front luggage storing, closed mechanical parts and smoother ride, especially with ladies this has become a part of their life.When my wife wanted one she left the decision to me since I knew automobiles well.",Suzuki
"Today while returning form office my access 125 broke down in near Kadki Highway in Pune. I could not even push is forward, so had to park it on the road side and call a mechanic. After opening the trans case he found that the clutch was completely burnt out and only dark powder remained. only one service was done in last month.",Suzuki
"Today, I noticed another problem - Even though tank is full, fuel guage read 3/4 and mileage problem has started again.",Suzuki
"Today, I want to talk about suzuki access 125, it had no very good experiance with suzuki so I want to share with you it will behelpful for you for choose best in your budget. I bought this bike for my mom and my sister, but they did not like it so nowdays I am using this bike it is not as expected I will give one or two stars to this suzuki access and I suggest you not to buy this one and go for activah for good performance,",Suzuki
Totally its a Good and Universal scooter for every one.Nice pickup and Milage.,Suzuki
"Truth be told I was the first to begin the bike on that day(Saturday – seventeenth 2007) early morning and it started with one single press of a catch… .not at all like the Honda activa which must be given beginning gag for few moments. So for bother free begin it beats Honda Activa contrasted showroom with showroom while genuine beginning may vary however despite everything I feel Suzuki get to scores here. Next clearly was the fumes note and increasing speed. I had my apprehensiveness as to will opening the throttle slow down the bike like Honda Activa(happens in frosty begin) however here again it scored. After warm up I went for a test drive and the fumes note is pretty interesting(more profundity) then activa in certainty its like Honda Eterno! As I opened the throttle to begin moving, the postponement from stop to intial development post opening the throttle is run of the mill of any variometric bike and after that it zooms past. The pickup shows up marginally better then Honda Activa however I didn't clock it.",Suzuki
"Tubeless, with the company rims. In case of puncture, the deflation will almost certainly be slow and not the blowout that often happens with tube type tires.",Suzuki
"Tuff up tyres not present in suzuki. Women rider got to be cautious in this case. This problem can be removed by asking dealer to put the tuff up solution in the tyres, it costs only Rs. 150 for each tyre.",Suzuki
Tvs Jupiter's mileage and suspension is much better than access but material quality is not good as access,Suzuki
"Two bike keys, First Aid box and Repair Kit box are also included in the package.",Suzuki
Two heavy people can easily cruise on this. You will love it's amazing pick up. Will become fan of it.,Suzuki
Typically a full non-budget product along with unworthy and unaccepted grandios.,Suzuki
U friends to buz this product engine is absoutely fine larger petrol tank .fine average with .with u all tge very best to buy this amazing vehicle in future u will not find any other bike like this I really enjoy driving this going in a long drive with my friends .amazing product,Suzuki
Ultimate disadvantage is its awful high and harsh sound. Not a stable two wheeler in all types of roads. A non-powerful vehicle with flop handling and control.,Suzuki
"Under that bodywork is an SEP-fied 124cc single cylinder engine with a CVT transmission. SEP(like BlueCore or HET) is a bunch of tweaks that allows Suzukis to offer more performance and economy. To wit, the new Access 125 make 8.7PS(no change) and 10.2Nm(up 0.4Nm). Underlining the extra performance is a steep drop in weight from 112kg(kerb) to just 102kg.",Suzuki
Underseat space is 20 litre (u can keep tupperwares or helmets or fruits or vegetables),Suzuki
Unimpressive performer and owerall quality is quit bad and mileage is not acceptable and not comfortable for long drive,Suzuki
"Unlike in the U.K., where they have a beginner catageory; here in India, there is no ""L"" (learner 125cc class) As a result,  the most inexperienced riders aim for the top of the class; whereas the other (experienced) riders may well choose to settle for the 125cc class.",Suzuki
Up to 90 Km/H Top speed you can enjoy comfortably handle and control.,Suzuki
"Updated on 21/10/09.Hello 2 every1 again!Well its been about 3 weeks for my scooty and at the begining only I had lots trouble with this......not because of its any kinda poor built or nething actually my sister met with an accident while learning it. And even there was no fault from my sister side, it was the problem in this scooty I tell u how, well when she left from the building she fell down from the right side of the scooty and even scooty feel down from the right side only and its right handle hit to the road. And due to that the accelerator wire near to that right handle was broken or was stuck so my sister had no such idea that somthing like this would have happend as it was done under that clutch where u cant see clearly, then she started the scooty again and without accelerating it as she switched on the engine the scooty ran at full speed and hit an electric board and my sister broken her leg, , , got lots pain and her leg was broken and now she is in the bed. I m not blaming access 100% but they should do something and work on it so that next time if something such thing happen again then the wire should not b so weak or some hard protection should b there so that it does not move from the place.",Suzuki
Using bike is a dream for any person in collage days but I chose a wrong scooty from past one year I am using suzuki access 125. It's not a slim bike and its a little heavy bike.,Suzuki
Using it for the last 3 years.Great pickup.Engine is superb Suzuki of course! Boot and ignition key are in the same place.So no chance of forgeting the keys while opening the boot as in case of some competitors.The main problem is the mileage.Max 40-45 km per litre in city conditions. Service centres are located at Manchaswar Industrial Estate and CRP square in Bhubaneswar.,Suzuki
Using this bike since 7 months but suspension is not good and mileage is very poor only 30kmpl. Suspension is very hard,Suzuki
"Ustomers. my pulsar 150 DTSi gives the mileage of 60kmpl to me.which is not bad.it is one of the comfortable bike in 150cc segment.it it reliable to the biggners too quickly. the service centers of pulsar situated everywhere in city/town, which provides superior service quality to the customers.it dont give any backpain to the driver due to its superior shockups, it is the smothest bike in 150cc range.which looks attracts all.ba condicont this his na gando bike thish bike is un confotwle fjuy bike is faltu",Suzuki
"VERDICT - Overall, suzuki has come up with a good package and this should be a great city scooter but well, how does it comes up against activa 125 well, you have to decide that.And also access requires a liitle more maintanence as compared to its rival.",Suzuki
Value for Money. This will pick the market of scooter. fancy style of scooter. some one have plan to parches,Suzuki
"Value for money: This bike will cost you approx Rs 62000, where company will provide you 1 year warranty and 4 free services, more over its a 125 cc bike where  any one can get 65+ mileage.",Suzuki
Vehicle is good but you please give preference from service point of view .,Suzuki
Verdict: A thorough effort from Suzuki to revive one of its popular scooters. It can make life difficult for the Activa 125,Suzuki
Very bad in  mileage. Initial 25-30 After three services it will be 30-35. Do not buy suzuki access in case mileage is issue.,Suzuki
"Very bad perfomance this suzuki. lose of your money, no updated, suzuki price are very high, I don.t like this suzuki",Suzuki
"Very bad service again. When I am going to control on break system, at that time it will produce bad sound. I have already complained about this and company took the action about it. still again the same problem occurs. Please consider it really very urgent base.",Suzuki
Very comfort than any other scooter in sitting becoz of wide seat for rider and also for ladies who sit back side.,Suzuki
Very comfortable seating position and feels totally in control for avg Indian height - 5ft 5in,Suzuki
"Very comfortable, and feels like specially made for girls . Has best collection of colors specially attracts girls.",Suzuki
Very disappointing experience they have and this vehicle proved wrong in many ways.,Suzuki
Very good invention by suzuki.its totally a family scooter.its seat is very comfortable.suitable for both boys and girls.very easy to ride and very easy to control.mileage is also good.its has a great front and back look which easily attract everyone.its the best scooter for city.its front side huge space makes it more comfortable scooter.its rates is also under everyone budget.it has some extra featers which makes it different from other normal scooter.mainly its speed is very good and its jump less.,Suzuki
Very good vehicle as compared to activa and other vehicles it is very good to buy.,Suzuki
Very good vehicle for small distance travel. Easy accessible and very much conformable. It is also affordable and very cheap. Good for especially for women as well as men. I loved it a lot and would recommend it to all!.,Suzuki
"Very nice scooter, Its being 1 week with this new motor! Prior I was using a bike and recently brought this and I feel more comfortable with this machine. Really awesome. The only thing I don't like its sound .While giving acceleration a annoying sound will come from engine, It may be because I used with honda motors. Apart from that everything with this machine is good.I covered more than 400 km in 1 week .Sales person said if the fuel indicator in meter blinks that means only 2 lts available. If its correct I'm getting 68 km/ltr mileage indeed!",Suzuki
Very nice this bike is very awesome I really love this while driving I really can't imagine  bike Mike was really smooth and Road icon seal during driving you Neverfull any type of jerk Road you will drive along .,Suzuki
Very power full engine and great pick up like 150cc Motorcycle. Very rough and tough Scooter. More than Honda Activa.,Suzuki
Very powerfull agaist other bike I am very amazed when I ride this bike this is so comgortable and so powerfull. Duzuki access 125 is very user friendly and bought this item 3 year ago and he does not have any big problem. Suzuki company are really so hard work for this item. This item are very so powerfull and so comfortable . This feature have been incorporated in keeping in mind partical usese in real world condition and he real and the comfort for indian riders. So powerfull with best prize.,Suzuki
"Very recently I happened to hear about MOUTHSHUT, and after visiting this for a couple of times now, I find that there are many people with experiences similar to that of mine (both positive and negative). I felt I should also record my voice over here and since this being the first review, I prefer it to be a positive one since I believe all good things should start sweet!",Suzuki
"Very reliable with good handling , charging slot , amazing ride and many more great features",Suzuki
Very smooth bike and all assecesrios and service center also hundling the customer and i m also purchase the suzuki bike with black colour.colour choice very beautiful costomer choise.thanks suzuki company.market chioce in black and white very most popular colour .,Suzuki
"Very smooth scooty, very stylish look , comfertable sitting seat , combi break system.Don't compare to activa, maestro, ray z.Because suzuki Access 125cc is best scooty.",Suzuki
"Ves, I own this bike. And I am fully satisfied with the suzuki access 125. First of all I would like to mention about the pickup of the bike. The 125 cc engine is of this bike is very powerfull in terms of pick up of the bike and speed. The noise of the silencer is minimum as compared with the other two wheelers. The design and looks of the bike is also great. The bike easy to handle and lightweight. There is adiquate space under the seat to keep helmat or other accessories. Overall the bike is best. But the fiber body can be a disadvantage. Otherwise the suzuki access 125 deserves full five stars. It is a Tough competition to the other non gear bikes in its category. Milage is best compared to others",Suzuki
"Vespa: WOW. Stunning looks, awesome engine, extremely powerful and proven track record for quality, hmmm. But where is the reliability as it was not many's choice coz of heavy pricing(around 80 k at that time) and I feared if the company shuts down for a reason spares would be a problem in the future considering heavy investment on buying cost.",Suzuki
"Vibrations: If engine oil change, gear oil change does not solve the problem(separate note below), then do consider upgrading the tires to Pirelli(Separate note below)",Suzuki

WHEN TAKING THE EXTRA ORINARY PERFOMANCE INTO CONSIERATION IT GIVES A NORMAL AVERAGE ie 40-43,Suzuki
"WHen I saw the new Suzuki Access 125 on the Suzuki stand at the Auto Expo, my heart sank. It looked so, em, weird! And then it did back flips. It’d gained torque and lost nearly 10 per cent of its weight. The(older) Access 125 is one of the most personable scooters we’ve tested. How would the new one fare? Time to find out.Styling",Suzuki
"Was experiencing the queeking sound while accelerating.Initially the service personals told me that it was a rattle and they fixed it. But after 2-3 days it surfaced again On the next service, I insisted them to have a closer look. This time they confirmed that it  was an issue with ""Clutch-Bell"" and replaced it as it comes under warranty.The next issue was with my speedometer. Its needle was on 0 always. For this they changed some cable and it costed me around 100. Had a terrible starting issue. After keeping the scooter idle for some time(on weekends), it fail to start.Was fixed at next service Changed rear tyre & tube @16.5kms. Went for the same MRF Nylogrip from an authorised dealer.Costed 1300/- for tyre and tube with a 1 year warranty for tyre .",Suzuki
Wat I hate the most the breaks are not so reilable.and some shokpsear problem so I rate this bike 3/5,Suzuki
"Water servicing person gave the reason that key is misplaced and he has not started yet, they were not able to locate the key where they have kept.

We are owning Access 125 for last 2.5 years. My wife finds it very comfortable to drop my daughter and attend her working place.

We bought access 125 vehicle from these people Worst customer relation in avanish suzuki showroom .They dint deliver the vehicle in time and they promise great till we pay amount then drag you for many days and executive is so stupid don't have manners to talk also and fully money minting place the worst place ever we went.,Suzuki
"We bought the Scooty 8 years ago. No doubt that it has lasted till now but it's not worth it. U had to spend a lot on service charges and repairs. The brake is never good. The mileage has been good enough though I guess. I don't think that's an issue. Not quite the best when it comes to comfort. But I guess the new model is better. Not reliable enough. You never know what problem could happen with it when. If the tires are good enough, it should ride smoothly. Appeal is okayish too. Overall, buy the new model if you wish to.",Suzuki
We bought the Suzuki access 125 before 3 weeks the vehicle is OK but till now we didn't get number...we have been following up on that but we receive very bad service...and which is really irritating..I don't see any good service they are giving.I definitely recommend not to buy a ve,Suzuki

"We gave the scooter for servicing today morning at Meghdoot, Bangalore. As per the technician the cost of replacing clutch related parts including belt is Rs. 3000/-. What worries me is, how can a rubber belt in that cost over Rs. 1000/- It is almost same as the cost a bike tyre.",Suzuki

"We have purchased new access 125cc month ago for father and younger sister.bike appealing is quite good one and attractive look a like. bike can't give comfort level to my father and sister as well due to his height issue, bike height or design is comparatively high or different which give discomfort for ladies.engine power has 125 cc is quite good performance.It is reliable bike, Road grip is also well although millage is very law which is around 40-50km per ltr and cost incurred for this bike is rs.72000/- which is very height, so it is not value for money bike go for less price 110cc bikes instead of this one.",Suzuki
We have purchased suzuki access125 in june 2008. then its performance was good. with great pick up. which shoes engine's power. handing is also good but this scooter is not suitable for most drive like field work as it gives very low mileage of only 25-30 km/ltr which is not sufficient. if you are looking for 125cc power scooter then it is good. rather than honda's activa is best option. its top speed which I achived is 90km/hr.,Suzuki
"We have the disc brake version here – on sale shortly – and braking, as you might expect, is strong but friendly. Ride quality, thanks to telescopic forks up front and a 12-inch front wheel, is calm and poised. Scooters generally have lower available wheel travel and hence either narrower sweet spots or bouncy rides. The Suzuki Access 125 is perhaps amongst the very best of the scooters in terms of ride quality.",Suzuki
We know that honda is leading but we shouldn't do this because which features are in this scooter is not in any other rate it 5 stars guys,Suzuki
We own Honda Activa Feb 2009 model (older version) and Suzuki Access (May 2009) model.This review is basically a comparison between two.Delivery period for suzuki access was 3 months for us. Activa was around 12 days.,Suzuki
We received the steel wheels and drum brake iteration of the scooter and I have to tell you that the optional alloy wheels and front disc brake should be a definite pick as they complete the look and undeniably add to the premium appeal.,Suzuki
We recently bought this scooty for me. the first thing I loved about this bike is its looks. its simple yet very comforting. the seat is very comfortable. I have to travel 40 km everyday to my office as I am a government servant and my office is 20 km away from my home. after ridding for 20 kms I don't feel tired. the mileage is also good as it is giving me a mileage of 50 at the moment. it is a reliable bike as I never faced any issue with this bike so far. road grip is also very good as it does not slip easily.,Suzuki
We test this scooter in Satara and other hilly roads of Mahabaleswer with Three Person.,Suzuki

"Wego and scooty for only choice of female. Still now men get weired looks when they are seen scooty it has a girls look. I don't trust TVS or Mahindra engines which was after20000 kms done then problem willing to start, week pulling and engine powe and mileage.",Suzuki
"Wego is equally good but there are lot many people have reported about self start problem of tvs wego. So , i thought why should i take the risk of 50000 rupees?",Suzuki
Welcome to all. I loveable bike and I am used in 10 months. The suzuki Access 125 is the best of the both worlds in  the compare all the bike.  Then it is very useful for especilly lady it is compartable one. suzuki Access 125 they are 6 colours but I love block and red. The are given good mileage 20-25km per litre is given the tire quality is good. The suzuki easily start system the rde makes the new access 125 comletly unblivable  then features have been nvorporated keeping in mind pctical usage in real workd conditions and the comport of india rders. I am spend money it is very useful for this bike how the suzuki access 125 is realy truthfullness. they are using road is very bad but the bike driving is very sumoothly . Then my child is site very compatable. the speed is very fast for the other bike. the appeal is very good.,Suzuki
"Welcome to the world of consumer review. Today scooter has regained its lost glory considering front luggage storing, closed mechancial parts and smoother ride, especially with ladies this has become a part of their life. I was little hesitant with WEGO because of lack of trust in TVS engines and not explred / proven in the market. overall: A decent scooter for a family but not a trendsetter. If you find my review useful please leave your comment and rate it. The button via which the digital meter is accessed is very losoe and can be taken out easily.",Suzuki
"Well  iam the user of Suzuki Access past 03 years . Its an Great scooty , an good product with good Design . But when it comes to servicing its really very Very bad .",Suzuki
"Well I am very lucky to have a service centre near my residence thats the best part, so any problem the guys are around though have not faced any.",Suzuki
"Well I had booked it in thane suzuki showroom on tuesday and got the scooty on sunday itself, but as I wanted to take it home on dasehara so waited for one more day.",Suzuki
Well I have been using this scooter for almost 3 years now and I think that this product is not worth of price.Suzuki Access 125 has 125cc engine whichgive it more pickup then average to this scooter.Since I have been using this product for quite a long time I can assure you that after doing it service regularly does not increase it average at all.Actually it give the average of 37-43 per litre which moderate at this price range.The biggest problem with this scooter is its body which neither stell or aluminiun rather it is made of some sort of plastic material.I refer you to not buy this scooter rather you can buy any other at this range.As your safety comes first,Suzuki
Well I wrote my opinions on it and you should choose the scooter depending on your needs and also which you love from your side.No matter how this review is.,Suzuki
"Well after months of speculation & a lot of confrontation with my wife, who incidentally is or I should say was a big big fan of Activa, I finally bought Access.And boys yeps I made the correct choice.",Suzuki
Well my review is based on one ride of this scooter. In my clge me and my friends decided to take this on rent as it was available for a cheap and affordable price. So we decided to take this non gear bike. But to my surprise it didn't worked out well foe us. It is not that powerful and not for hilly areas. The tires are two small and vehicle running on high speed start to go out of control. The fuel consumption is ok and provides good mileage in comparison to other. The comfort is less as compared to activa. The vehicle is reliable in the city area only in the Hilly area the performance decreases at high rate. The looks dont matter what's important is its performance which it fails to deliver on longer distance journeys whereas its opponent activa does its job easily and more comfortably. So to be honest I wont recommend this even after its services are good but still don't go for it.,Suzuki
"Well takin bout height & the ground clearance access is taller & broader too, again not a shame for guys as this is meant for family riding.",Suzuki
"Well trust me, when u drive it, you wont leave it soon. You will just love to drive it more n more n more. I dont say Activa is bad, not at all otherwise you wouldn't have seen 90% of activa's on the road, It's just I like being unique so went for this and its not at all bad man, nowhere u can say its bad. Lets see if it gives any problem in the future, will update u then. Bye and Drive safe",Suzuki
"Well, I have exprienced my scooter for last 3years now I am raiding 20 km to my office .very good suspension-even my father feels comfortable as pillion over 50 kms, pick up till know 150CC back could catch up with the acceleration .power delivery very dependable, breaks works superbly40-0within 15 meters.Ample space I can bring 10 kg rice other groceries at front leg space my office bag storage thare",Suzuki
Went for a drive. The scooter is very smooth  and suspension is superb no engine noise. had a comfortable drive....,Suzuki
"Whaaaaaaaaaat a bike I say Whaaaaaaaaaat a bike. M using suzuki access since 2008 still going on. Wow what an experience. Have tried all the mopeds but compared to dio or activa, access is the tough of the toughest mopeds I say. Have spent almost 50k for it but for my mistake. Accidents! Thought of selling it but I love is soooooooooooooooooooo much that cant sell it no ways! . 125cc and the performance, the pickup is mind blowing. None of the mopeds gives such a performance. Yes mileage is a bit less but the power is also high accordingly. I have a black access. 9 years successfully running. The petrol tank should have been outside. This is a feedback. That's all for it",Suzuki
"What I did miss was the snap and zing of the older Access. Suzuki says the transmission is all-new – as is the engine – and I suspect that the extra torque and a more linear power spread allows slightly higher gearing which feels good to use but robs the new Access 125 of that surge that I so loved last time around. Be that as it may, it is hard to ignore the maturity and ease of use. In fact, this restraint shows in the dynamics as well.",Suzuki
"What I don't like about access is it's mileage. You will get near about 25-30 kms of mileage (hence, in 1 litre of petrol, scooter will take you 30 kms) which is not that great.",Suzuki
"What also impressed us is the ride quality. The wide and long seat is plush and comfortable and it's suitably complemented by the suspension. All sorts of bumps are absorbed quite nicely, so potholes and minor road undulations are taken care of without any judders.",Suzuki
"What happended on the last Sunday was horrible. I was riding the scooter and while running, the rear wheel jammed. I have been using two wheelers for more than 20 years. It was the first time that the rear wheel jammed while running.",Suzuki
"Whatever you do, don't go for TVS Olivia. From what I’ve heard, these are crazy on wet roads or at speeds above 60 Km/H.",Suzuki
Wheels should not fool suzuki company is a best company in the world,Suzuki
"When I asked about the same, Satya service in charge person intervened & said that She had come on previous day & this is the reason they are attending, when other person who also came on previous day was not addressed. When I asked Satya to follow queue system he is saying he will learn this from me & implement the same. I said this should not be learned from me, this is basic etiquette you should follow.",Suzuki
When I bought myself this Suzuki Access 125 Scooter. The Dealer told me after first or second service the scooter will give 50 or 55 kmpl mileage in city. Now it has been 2 years still the mileage issue continues. Now the mileage gives me like 25 kmpl approx. But the performance I would say it is fantastic. By the time how you use your vehicle it adapts to it just like that even this scooter performed very well upto my expectation before my previous scooter. About the Comfort it's extremely outstanding. The spacious seat and luggage compartment that's what it makes the family Scooter.,Suzuki
When I called them again and again they said form are not yet dispatched. Very poor Service and bad customer relation management.,Suzuki
When I called they telling that 23 to 30 Days may take to delivery. After I had spoken to manager he says 15 to 20 days the goods have to come from Delhi.,Suzuki
When I checked the scooty luckily for me it was on main stand and I was standing on the scooty and as I switched on the engine it was moving so badly and if it was not on the main stand then even I would have not controlled it as it runs at its high speed where u cant control it and cant do nething about it.,Suzuki
When I first used it . It was a good experience driving this scooty . I thought that all scooty have the same driving experience .,Suzuki
"When I had booked the vehicle, they said it takes 60days for delivery after booking(may be because of high demand),",Suzuki
"When I purchased it, it was fine enough with less complaints. The only issue that I had was that its pickup was'nt good at all. I talked to the dealer he said that the pickup will gradually improve after the 1st service. Then soon after 1 month self start stopped working and it was very difficult to start it with the kick.",Suzuki
"When I saw the new Suzuki Access 125 on the Suzuki stand at the Auto Expo, my heart sank. It looked so, em, weird! And then it did back flips. It'd gained torque and lost nearly 10 per cent of its weight. The(older) Access 125 is one of the most personable scooters we've tested. How would the new one fare? Time to find out.",Suzuki

When I saw the new suzuki acess 125 at the suzuki stand at the auto expo my heart sank.,Suzuki
When I was riding it on expressway it's energy and taking care of was astounding it's top pace touches 105kmph in the blink of an eye and simple to keep up in light of the fact that it's a Suzuki access as its name the solidness and execution is good.,Suzuki
When I was riding it on highway it's power and handling was amazing it's top speed touches 105kmph in no time and easy to maintain because it's a Suzuki scooty as its name the durability and performance is upto mark. The service is very affordable and easy parts availability with great power and performance in good cost as a great scooty should be must buy as great value for money.,Suzuki
"When asked about the dent on mud guard, the supervisor blamed that it was already there before the vehicle given for service and misbehaved.",Suzuki
When ever I ride suzuki access 125 I feel very happy to ride.,Suzuki
When it comes to buying the bike I would recommend to buy the accelerator bike. Because the most comfortness u feel in this category of bike.,Suzuki
"When it comes to control and handling in the scale of 0 to 10 I can give it number 8, fare braking system",Suzuki
"When it comes to performance, the Access 125 delivers in spades. Powered by a refined 125cc engine, it provides smooth and effortless acceleration. The engine is peppy and responsive, making it easy to navigate through city traffic and overtake slower vehicles. The scooter also offers excellent fuel efficiency, allowing riders to go long distances without worrying about frequent refueling stops.",Suzuki
"When it comes to scooter first thing comes to our mind is Fuel Economy, Comfort, Control and last but not the least is looks. Suzuki access is a combination of all qualities which we wants in a scooter. Riding is so comfortable that long rides are just a child play, fuel economy of 55-60 on long routes is also good. All that features makes it a buy buy scooter.",Suzuki
"When it comes to scootys there is huge competiton many people tell activa is best but from my opinion access is better than activa my brother took activa but I bought access 125 now I tried both over 3 months but I feel that access is better but when it comes to comfort zone activa is best because access shock absorber is not too good. overall access 125 is good like mileage, battery, pick up etc but if you wanted good suspension better u go activa thank you",Suzuki
"When it comes to the scooter market in India, almost all scooters have calmly settled at the 110cc, 8bhp mark. It's as if they thought Indians really din't need a more powerful scooter. A few years ago, if you needed something more powerful than the Activa, your only option was a Suzuki Access or a Vespa, which was insanely expensive. Oh, there was the Mahindra Duro too, which was rather uncommon and didn't catch on. Even today, the list is still limited, with the only new additions being the Activa 125 launched in 2015 and the Swish, which was launched in 2012.",Suzuki
"When my 22000 service was done, some engine sound started coming immediately after wards.",Suzuki
"When the market is rolling with vehicles like honda activa , honda aviator , tvs jupiter , and hero maestro . The upgraded version of this suzuki acces can be a nice game in the moped industry. The newly upgraded design will play an important role in increasing the sales back. Now the suzuki access comes with a slightly powerful engine of 125cc . Which is slightly more than that of honda activa. If we see the comfort aspect , then this is the plus point of this one . As this model gives you a higher comfort",Suzuki
"When the scooter pass over the speed breaker, the engine gets switched off by its own, this thing is quite annoying, dangerous and risky.",Suzuki
When we come to its look this is the most elegent scooter for indian market specially its chrome finishing and it is with 3 option,Suzuki
When we ride it we feel pleasure because of it's great looks and if we are planning for hangout with friends then I prefer to this scooty.,Suzuki
"When we take about appearance, it has good look and it is useful for both young and old age people.",Suzuki
When we talk about the mileage then company claims that it gave mileage of 65 Kmpl but it is not true as it gave mileage of 30-35 Kmpl which is almost half of that what they claim.,Suzuki
"Whenever I visit our hometown, I will be using it as my primary transportation vehicle. I used to go for long drives like about 100KM and till now I haven't seen any issue with it and moreover I see it is very comfortable and also gives good mileage when I go for long drives.",Suzuki
"Whether you are a guy or a lady, public will not leave this opportunity to lynch you. You will be severely beaten, your clothes will be torn in the process, and your vehicle is likely to be set on fire.",Suzuki
Which cannot be compared to any 125 cc engines of other companies,Suzuki
While Handover the vehile the service guy gave a shock by telling the milage will be between 25 to 35.since I am promised with 45 to 50. I am disappointed.Afterwards he told milage will pick up after 2nd service.,Suzuki
"While Honda is renowned for its scooter sales and is the undisputed king of the Indian scooter segment, another Japanese two-wheeler manufacturer has followed its footsteps. Suzuki Motorcycle India’s highest selling product is the Access 125 scooter.

While booking itself I asked the maximum time to deliver for all the work and they only promised 8th June or before as I will be very busy with my office work and personal work.,Suzuki

"With regards to the bike advertise in India, all bikes have serenely settled at the 110cc, 8bhp check. They thought Indians truly din't require an all the more intense bike. A couple of years prior, in the event that you required something more intense than the Activa, your exclusive choice was a Suzuki Access or a Vespa, which was madly costly. Goodness, there was the Mahindra Duro as well, which was fairly unprecedented and didn't get on. Indeed, even today, the rundown is as yet constrained, with the main new augmentations being the Activa 125 propelled in 2015 and the Swish, which was propelled in 2012. Since the 125cc choices were constrained when it was propelled, the Suzuki Access got a ton of consideration from individuals who needed the simplicity of a bike yet required something more usable than the 110cc bikes. The looks of the Access were not all that much, and shape a few edges, it looked like Suzuki had replicated the market pioneer, Activa. There were some huge changes however, as far as highlights. The seat on the Access was a level one instead of the bi-level seat on the Hondas. The Suzuki had the capacity to open the seat from the start reassure itself. Going to the ride and dealing with, the Access felt more steady than most different bikes owing fundamentally to the somewhat higher weight and the more drawn out wheelbase. The front end was all around weighted and helped by the adjustable suspension, taking care of was exceptionally steady and certainty motivating. It wasn't precisely extravagant yet on state streets it felt agreeable. Many individuals guarantee that the pickup is terrible. When I rode it, I understood that the equipping is not quite the same as Honda bikes so while it doesn't take off from a stop, the midrange and best end is extremely solid. I rode the Access broadly in Goa for thee days and I could joyfully journey at 70 throughout the day. On the off chance that pushed, it could touch a best speed of 90+ which was amazing and the Access felt stable at those paces. Brakes were great as well, however crisis braking would in any case require a considerable amount of exertion and would agitate the bicycle. There was adequate power accessible at all velocities, very not at all like the 110cc bikes which felt like underpowered after 60kph. The motor was more harsh contrasted with Hondas and the fumes note was somewhat reckless. I can state this as the bicycle which I leased was a generally new bicycle with just 6000kms on the odo. I dealt with a FE of 35kpl with two individuals on load up and a 80% thruway riding while at the same time keeping up speeds over 70kph for more often than not. I'd say that is truly useful for a 125cc bike, I claimed a Yamaha Gladiator 125 which returned me a normal FE of 40kmpl on thruways, so being a programmed, this FE wasn't awful in any way.",Suzuki

Worst vehicle I have ever seen.In winters this vehicle gives lot of problem in revving up. Even the manufacturers are not interested in solving the problem inspite of repeated requests.Avoid purchase of this vehicle as you will end up in buying a lame donkey.,Suzuki

"Yeah friends, I am here to share some thoughts on my Scooty access 125. As you know 125 engine is enough for one's desire for powerful riding. In my locality there is a slant height , on which maximum of scooties does'nt make out. But access is powerful enough to get over it . It's looks are satisfactory and not too bulged from backside . Headlights are satisfactorily good . Comfort of seat is awesome . Best part of it is that it's fuel efficiency is great compared to its engine size . At last I have concoction of good and bad views",Suzuki
Yes it is. access 125 is really a powerful scooter I have ever ride onn. its pickup and power is really amazing. my friend own this and I get a chance to ride on it so I enjoy riding it.,Suzuki
"Yes, I own this bike. And I am fully satisfied with the suzuki access 125. First of all I would like to mention about the pickup of the bike. The 125 cc engine is of this bike is very powerfull in terms of pick up of the bike and speed. The noise of the silencer is minimum as compared with the other two wheelers. The design and looks of the bike is also great. The bike easy to handle and lightweight. There is adiquate space under the seat to keep helmat or other accessories. Overall the bike is best. But the fiber body can be a disadvantage. Otherwise the suzuki access 125 deserves full five stars. It is a Tough competition to the other non gear bikes in its category. Milage is best compared to others.",Suzuki
"Yes. Yes.! This twowheeler simply rocks and the performance is simply awesome, still its having all those features like smooth engine, comfortable ride, excellent pickup, very good electricals, perfect stability on the road.",Suzuki
Yesterday my dad brought suzuki access with matte black colour.It has killing design in the front and sides as well the back.I like the brown seat cover.But the thing is the head lamp will be always on even in the mornings it doesn't have an on off switch.i dont know why but future bikes will be in this model only.It has more acceleratoin then jupiter and activa.This is the main thing I love it .its accelerations like vrooooooom.And the top speed is around 90-95 kmph.I tried it I doesnt goes beyond that,Suzuki
Yet I am still using it have 125 cc engine.because of that u can chasing it on mountain easily and,Suzuki
Yet I am still using it. It have 125 cc engine. because of that you can chasing it on mountain easily and it's pick up is so nice than other.,Suzuki
You can Set its seat according to your length so its feature is awesome it is really comfortable with everyone.,Suzuki

You can get milage between 45-50 kmpl according to your driving conditions. The suspension setup of this scooter is very good. The suspension are better then the activa 125.,Suzuki

You can trust this scooter as this scooter is designed and built a very famous automobile company. It,Suzuki
You can use this scooter for driving in city or in crowded areas as well as for long distance riding also.,Suzuki
You can xperience a smooth ride.the braking is good and its a fuel efficient bike.,Suzuki
You do get more feel of the road surface due to this trait and turning into a corner feels more confident. It's the rear suspension that has probably been worked upon considering that the scooter will always be ridden with a pillion. It is set stiff to the extent that the rear tends to step out of line and bounces back harshly over rumble strips and small speed breakers.,Suzuki
You friendsibwould like toshare my views in Suzuki access125. As you all know very well about the standard and quality Suzuki,Suzuki
You have to use choke when starting in the morning and should always do a kick start since the self start does not work . The dealer says that the this problem will be solved once I run at least 500 to 600 kms and engine gets tuned.The tyres are also very good. I strongly recommend buying Access for people who want comfort of driving in this maddning traffic of Bangalore.,Suzuki
You may result drive it for 2-3 hours but after that you would get much very exhausted.,Suzuki
"You might have to replace poor quality of battery used by them at ur cost only after one yr(normally in activa etc 3 yrs) you won't get any response from company on their website or from dealer, u can get spares only from dealer as same r not available in the open market",Suzuki
You will be boured to drive it and the tyres are also worn out very early the company suzuki is nice in making cars but not in scooties I would say you that you should not buy this scooty and waste your money.,Suzuki
You will enjoy riding this powerful scooter. Even at 60km/hr you will not feel the speed. Riding is steady without any vibration. Mileage is about 40km/lit normal for this category. Breaking is excellent and smooth. No spongy feelings. Seat is cofortable and soft. No starting problems or any other mechanical problems.,Suzuki
Your authorized service center will say me your scooter engine is down u make new engine.,Suzuki
"Your mon @dad , and grandfarther very good to drive.my mon is also using by market.my brother using a school.any your famaliy member are good to drive this Activa.",Suzuki

Meanwhile I have changed the colour from blue to white, as I liked the white colour very much. It costed me around 5.5k approximately.",Suzuki
"a full size helmet and also much things like gloves, bottle can be together kept in it and that thing is pretty good",Suzuki
"a girlish looks. I don't trust TVS engines since they are not robust and to my knowledge there is no Scooty I have seen used for more than 50000 kms, as some one complaints of starting trouble, weak pulling and very poor mileage. I was small hesitant with WEGO because of lack of trust in TVS engines and not explored/ proven in the market.",Suzuki
a. ) Suzuki only makes 100 units per month- as told by the showroom guys.,Suzuki
a.) Riding and Handling : The riding comfort is pretty good and is tall compared to my Kinetic. Also the seating position for driving is also very comfortable and is at a good angle.

"am comparing it with not normal activa , not the 125 cc version. But its reselling cost is not as good as activa. And its engine starts creating problem after few years. Its not very good for long term usage. Activa is still the king. Its available in black white blue red silver colour.",Suzuki

as per my experience vehicle is good up to 2 years.so I decided to sold the vehicle..,Suzuki
as we know that in this time in market so many scooty are available which gives heiger mileage so I am not satisfy with this scooter in terms of mileage.,Suzuki
average is low in starting but average wil increse after 2 to 3 service,Suzuki
b.) Delivery period is way too long. ( due to short manufacturing and supply),Suzuki
b.) Head and Tail light : The head light is very powerful and ensures u see all potholes in front of you for safe driving. In some review I had read about a beam hitting eye when high beam was switched on. But I did not see this personally in my scooter (seems more like one of type). My head light at delivery was not aligned properly so had to bend it slight down to focus more on road (2 minutes job). The tail light is pretty powerful and easily noticeable from behind (very much required in Bangalore).,Suzuki
because of air filter the road grip is also not so good some time it stop in between the road.,Suzuki
because the enegine of this scooter is very strong which takes a very less petrol when I took this in new condition from showroom its average was near about 70km to 75km per liter I was very happy about this and I haved it from last 3 year I will also upload my vehicle picture and it is fully comfortable as it have a long seat and very easy to drive. it is fully reliable and beleave-able you can buy it even closed your eyes the controling system is fantastic new model comes in both breaks even it comes in 4 or 5 colours I have grey its all colours is very beautiful this vehicle is trust of owner,Suzuki

best thing is front shocker it is first scooter that is provide better shocker not like activa or other scooter.Best scooter create by suzuki.

"big space for foot rest and easy to keep heavy baggage and material for transportation purpose, comfortable to drive in the city, 125cc Engine, seat is longer, good road grip, bike comes in 7 colors, it has tubeless tyre with drum brakes, new bs4 engine for controlling air pollution, this scootys price is about 60 to 61 thousand. I recommend people buy this bike.",Suzuki
but after the first service it’s the same even the engine gets off when I drive in some steep road and again I have to start my engine that takes lot of fuel but except the mileage other things are cool it has great pick up Wonderful handling the road grip also is very good .,Suzuki
but at the end of 2017 suzuki has launched a new scooter ACCESS 125 . which is having the engine of 125 CC . as compared to other scooter in india this scooter comes with new and lattest technology and with great power.,Suzuki
but only after a month my wife called me and told me that her bike has been stopped working and behaving like dead.,Suzuki
but some problems suffer if speed crosses 60 km per hour it starts vibrating and gives poor drive feel,Suzuki
"but still not exced the milage of 40 kmpl above, i wanted a milaged bike what I do to get good loking bike they showroom staff are tels always lieing for selling them bikes. this bike not a milaged bike its just only 40 KMPL.",Suzuki
but the last thing what I really want to say about the Suzuki Access 125 is the pickup of the scooter is the best in the segment of scooters not a single scooter can beat Access 125 if there is a racing between all the scooters definitely Suzuki Access 125 will win the race,Suzuki
but the scooter has biggest problem of filter. the air filter of the scooter is at bottom. thats why I am not able to drive in rainy season. because the filter is filled with water and does not clear air',Suzuki
"but these people are more slow then government.....I have never I my life heard that a bike can be waiting fpor 6months...will booking the bike they say ""are v vl give it to u in a month""the biggest liar on the earth..",Suzuki
but was propmty refilling every time I passed 200 KMS. But the indicator was replaced at the 4th service,Suzuki
"buy it without any doubt in mind. it is best for your family ,( both ladies and gents)",Suzuki
by all over look it is successful bike with a brand name SUZUKI,Suzuki
c.) Indicators : The indicators are good and nicecly placed in the front and at the back. I had taken the beeper accessory (extra). But worth to take it in Bangalore (visual + sound ),Suzuki

comfort while driving is also important and suzuki has taken care of that with its shock absorbers.,Suzuki
comfort: it is bad in comfort in seating in storage a helmet is not storing .a vibration on 60 speed limit,Suzuki
comfort= it gives a good comfot and while travellin you can feel so good and you can get shock off zer to get safe fro speed breaker and as usual it is so comfortable to drive it,Suzuki
"coming to mileage it gives less compared to geared bikes, long journey is not comfortable in this bike. It is only for local use. This bike gives the safety for the legs in small accidents compare to other bikes. some fact of this bike, The display is all new too, but comes across as a rather bland effort at bettering the competition. It is rather simplistic in design. The dominant analogue part gives clear indication of speed, the tiny digital display section reads out odometer, fuel gauge, service reminder and two trip meter figures",Suzuki
comming to the performance of access 125 . it has the best performance in scooter category . suzuki has take over all the market of the scooter . because of of its amazing retro look and best featuers of bike.,Suzuki

f.) Mileage : Well for the fist tank fill I got around 45Kms/lt and with subsequent I got around 45-50Kms/lt. Since I have not gone for first service I felt this is a decent mileage. My friends are getting around 55+. Again my driving is smooth and I dont accelerate suddenly from signals. will switch of the engine in signals (> 1.5 min wait).,Suzuki
feature alloy tires wheel and 8.58 bhp power radial tyres self starter its a most popular gear less bike basically designed for fuel efficiency good choice,Suzuki
"feel free and take this scouter it is very good great and good look, and dcent look scouter",Suzuki
first of all the design is stand part. it looks so futuristic ride quality and comfort is best in segment. You will not get this same acceleration in any other gear less scooter in same price bracket. I would highly recommend you to take its test drive before buying any scooter if you're planing to buy.,Suzuki
firstly I would like to appreciate its engine durability and power output. its engine is really very powerful and it can carry upto 120 kg without any problem. and its fuel efficiency is quite impressive. and it gives good mileage which is near about 50 kmpl. 2. and the second good thing is its design which is very impressive and attractive. there is no compromise with any feature.,Suzuki
"firstly starting one month is was good, milage everything was fine and then suddenly there was a huge drop of milage not only milage accelerator also had problems and they say free servicing but still they will change your oil and they will charge you.",Suzuki

fuel consumption is much better it travels near about 40km in 1 liter. pick up of the bike is same as it on first day.,Suzuki
fuel consumption of this bike is similar to others in this segment it gives 35 to 40 kmpl.,Suzuki
fuel consumption(kms/litre)= it gives amazing fuel conspution,Suzuki
"fuel consumption- suzuki claims 54kmphl for Access. before 1st service my access has delived 43kmpl, after 1st service mileage was fluctuated often . I had visited showroom for proper tuning I found no use and approached suzuki staff for help . they had done a 100ml road test for my access . in heavy traffic conditions my access has moved 3.8km/100ml and 5.2km/100ml in light traffic on the highway . . we have to understand our vehicle and drive according to that . mileage has imprved  after 2nd and 3rd services . now I am getting aeound 45kmpl overall as per my petrol log eides I am able to get 48-50kmpl.",Suzuki
g.) Storage Space : Good storage space under the seat (my covered helmet goes in ease) and in front (extra fitting). Also the space in the front between legs also could be used. Over all I did not miss my kine space :-),Suzuki
"gets open from the front always we don't want to remove keys, and the tank capacity is good if you are going to buy",Suzuki
getting any back pain seat is so smooth and width of the seat is sufficient,Suzuki
"getting the bike on center stand is tough, thanks for the side stand. the kick start does work, tried it just for the heck of it.",Suzuki
"give this scooter is great look and only one thing is missing in this is the external fuel tank, but it is ok since the seat",Suzuki

"handling is fine I would say but still disc brakes are missing that decreases the braking power of the Scooty .so friends I would say it's not a value for money , I prefer Honda Activa and Yamaha fascino over this",Suzuki
handling is very good no problem at all even for ladies it is very nice,Suzuki

he was decided to purchase new honda activa but suzuki launched new access when he got a test drive he shocked and he changed decision finally got new access 125 and he is very satisfied,Suzuki

iam not working yet on it for doing some wrong argues so not for healthy men and womens,Suzuki
if I talk about it I will say the following things to help you,Suzuki
if u need it in 30-35 days then you've to pay entire amount on the 1st day itself.,Suzuki
if we look for comfort like any other scooters access is good for womens and provides the same comfort. As its a 125 cc access it don't give anything more. Then comes speed yes its speed is more then Activa or other scooters but the pickup is slow and according to Mumbai traffic we all know there are many speed barkers and pot holes so for this we need instant pickup and control.,Suzuki
"if you accelerate unevenly.The pickup is amazing.And on curves, the control is perfect & well balanced.",Suzuki
if you are compare various model of scooty then you will found that this is one of best because its give the very reliability options with 3D Look  and stunning road grip  so you can run this scooty without feel any fear.,Suzuki
"if you are comparing with some other model in various bikes like activa, Jupiter etc., the suspension is",Suzuki
if you are searching a scooty for your self then buy this only because this vehicle gives you the experiences of bike and tention mukt from gear shifting.,Suzuki
important parameter that one considers when buying a vehicle. I calculated the,Suzuki
in 4 years I have met with 3 accidents . because of the worst breaking system . there is no combi break system you have to manage speed yourself .,Suzuki
"in my opinion every one should buy this as nowadays traffic and pollution problems are increasing every day. if we have a scooter like this then there is no tension about pollution, traffic, and petrol as it has such a good millage",Suzuki
"in now a days suzuki has a big rival, because honda is entering in a market with his flagship scooter Activa 3G.",Suzuki
"in the steering wheel and has a significant sound produced when a good acceleration is given. This kind of vibration or sound is something which I never found when my Activa was as new as this.

It also has a LED display which is appreciable. It provides a mileage of 64kmpl. Overall the vehicle has the value for money.",Suzuki
their is no external fuel filling so I am not suggest to any one to buy this Suzuki Access 125.,Suzuki
their is no much change in the recent version as compared to the previous one only new color is available none else.,Suzuki
then it would be better that I would have booked activa or dio...atleast I would have got the bike on time...any ways now,Suzuki
then neither kick nor self start the after some time that start.,Suzuki
then slowly picks up the grip. This is an advantage as well as a disadvantage.,Suzuki
"there are different color option available for the customers like white, black, blue, silver and red . the special editition access is in white color . recently in 2018 the suzuki has also launched two more special edition their color are mate black and mate grey .",Suzuki
there has been no mechanical breakdowns so far and hope she serves me well for many years to come. ok thats itfriends.. dolet me know how you felt about this review !,Suzuki
there is a space on front where u can keep you mobile while charging and the digital speedometer have been given with the indication of change oil in ever 1500KM,Suzuki
there is not enough space for three people to sit . many activa's and scooty can have three people sitting comfortably but in access if you try there are lots of chances loosing balance.,Suzuki
there were a long stories with this bike it had a bad service centers,Suzuki
these from automobile spare part shops and get it fitted outside. These are,Suzuki
"they have given combination of brake the brake liner have been improved there is a charging slot where u can charge you phones, whereas you have to buy the charging adapter on your own.",Suzuki
they never quote the price on any letterhead but scribble the price on the catalogue.,Suzuki
they should ride .i dont like this bike because its not vomfortable fir my self and not good for ride so first u choose,Suzuki
third bad thing of suzuki access 125 is there front saspenssion is work very hard therfor the body parts of this bikes get loos,Suzuki
"this bike is comes with 124cc Air cooled , 4stroke engine which is Run on petrol.",Suzuki
this bike look is different from other his head lamp look very attractive even they have 5 different color so you can chose which color you want.,Suzuki
"this bike then just go don't think much you have decided right one. Go ahead you will feel after some more year, yes I",Suzuki
this bike very heavy and bulk when you compare the other forms of bike and it would be difficult to handle for some of the weak or strength less,Suzuki
this design is over colourd and feels like annoying and some how awkward many are not satified with available colours'z or you can say it,Suzuki
this is my genuine review about my scooter which I brought on jan'17. top model suzuki access with front disc brake.,Suzuki
this is one of the comfortable scooter the seat is not too broad and spacious in the front. storage is also high.,Suzuki
this non gear scooter having lot of changes this scooter give mileage 50 in overall comapany claims 64 but according to my use I get 50.,Suzuki
"this scooter engine 4 Cycle, Single Cylinder, Air Cooled, SOHC, 2 Valve",Suzuki
this scooter millage is best 64 kmpl and best ficture kick and self start. and Battery Capacity,Suzuki
"this to you all, you will be fell great comfort while you rider this scooter other then activa, Jupiter etc.",Suzuki
this vehicle is low as compared to other vehicle. The new design,Suzuki
tho its a moped it has enough power to lanesplit at good speed,Suzuki
thumps up for this scooter all the time and this bike can be used for heavy works and all.,Suzuki
to a completely new design and a lot of changes under the skin but the big question is candice new access really reacted the succeess,Suzuki
to home from office on the previous night. That may have caused the issue.,Suzuki
to my surprise milage dropped from 41 to 35(totally frustated),Suzuki
to ride with this Suzuki Access is some expensive to others because mileage is not so good in starting it gives the meilege of 46-48 kmpl but after 8-10 months meilage is goes down then it gives the mileage only 35-36 kmpl only some time 40 kmpl.,Suzuki
"tool from toolbox. As he said, I coudnt even remove a nut.So finally I purchased the liver for 120 rs",Suzuki
"top speed - well! most of the teens out there, must be thinking top speed kitna hoga, well guys at most 90, that too when you are at full throttle continuously, practically not possible on city's busy roads but yeah after 85 there are vibrations and handle shakes a little  maybe due to light body .",Suzuki
top speed 91kmp and mileage 60 per liter its my experience 125 cc engine available on model and drum bike price 60000 and disk bike price 65000.,Suzuki
topped up with the odometer reading at 94.0 and re-topped up with the odometer,Suzuki
"touring on access - I had confusion whether the scooters are suitable fir long drives,but access has cleared away my confusion with its stunning performance . we travelled a few long drives on our access of which the longest is 180km drive.",Suzuki
two wheeler I personally recommended for Suzuki 125.  After long days very nice model of scooter at all.,Suzuki
"two years back I use to go on this bike for my collage it wont start in rain season and winter season  because its battery was very poor we use to kick this bakwas bike many times even that kick rod was poor it given us daily exercise by that kick its not so comfortable for long drives, many parts were damaged and there were no proper showrooms available near to me and in every repair shop they use to say why you people buy this bike there were no proper availability of spare parts even I faced many problems with  spare parts issue my brother nearly spend 10000 for repair still its remains same it came to bore and we finally  got free from that bike in 2k16 we sold that bike to one bakara with the help of quicker . thanks to quicker but there were  huge loss for my bro nearly 40k we sold just for 22k",Suzuki
tyres along with the shock absorbers make up the suspension system. Hence inflating,Suzuki
tyres to the pressure specified by the manufacturer is very important.,Suzuki
u can tilt the handle 45 Degrees on either side(i think it should be same with all scooters).,Suzuki
under that bodywork is an SEP -fied 124cc single cylinder engine with CTV transmission SPE is a bunch of tweak that allows suzukis to offer more perfomance the new access 125 make 8.7ps adn 10.2Nm,Suzuki
"vehicle’s suspension is already on the harder side, hence over inflation will adversely",Suzuki
"very comfortable to drive, I also drove activa and jupiter but felt suzuki access is very comfortable than others.",Suzuki
very decent and rich look is main criteria which impresses me the most.,Suzuki
"very smooth and good for me its almost end of 6th month and its still like it was in the beginning, the best thing I was like in the bike the height, the space, the boot space beneath the seat is much more in the normal scooter",Suzuki
"very smooth, no problem in self start, handling of scooter good, looks also very sober, but the fiber body is not safe without metal body guard.",Suzuki
we all buy this and its mileage gives a satisfaction and help us to afford a good automotive,Suzuki
"we also get nitrox monoshock which is amazing in this prize range, the bike looks fresh and modern looks wise there is no doubt that this bike will definite catch others eye son it this bike offers great reliability which is amazing.",Suzuki
we you are going with 80 speed but when you dispose break in above 80 speed,Suzuki
well we got 48.1kmp on our city cycle and 58.5kmpl on the highway which round out to 50.7kmpl overall.,Suzuki
"well, If you are planning to buy new two wheeler then thare is more option in the market like honda activa , tvs jupitor , hero mystro etc.",Suzuki
when I was driving through a rough patch. it became difficult for me to sit any where I mean there are no such thing called as suspension .,Suzuki
"when i saw the access 125 2017 model, it looks great and feel less weight compared to activa 4g. i have''t buy this scooter but test drive experience is good. i feel its producing more sound compared to its competators. overall budget bike and no chances of failure in any corner except fiber body. i am willing to buy this shortly. please share expert reviews and help to selectfinalize this scooter",Suzuki
when it comes to the milage of the scooter the comlany claims that its milage is 64 kmpl on road . but from the customer side the review of milage is 40 to 45 kmpl on city roads.,Suzuki
when someone want to buy scouter so suzuki access 125 it great choise =then any other scouter .,Suzuki
when we comes to special edition the suzuki has given their customer an option of special edition .,Suzuki
whenever starting the vehicle for the first time in the day. This will ensure,Suzuki
which affect the comfort and safety of the vehicle. Keep in mind that this,Suzuki
while driving it ayyracts people around it by its nice appeal.,Suzuki
while driving suddenly engine stop and even though you might have your tanks filled it stopped working .,Suzuki
wht is the use for buying it when you dont get it when u want it....,Suzuki
why there is no upgardes for this scooters for years together still mileage issues and comfort issues,Suzuki
"why we need to buy this bike, because it has good pickup like geared bikes,",Suzuki
with all new facilities and the new model and successufll rating by people,Suzuki
"with all this when I went for a test ride, there was no chance of going for activa. smooth ride made me fall in luv with access.",Suzuki
with the 3 accidents . two times the body was finished . due to its non metallic body .,Suzuki
with the beileve of suzuki brand it is very much actrative bike,Suzuki
women's and some how when it comes to the mileage the it is also not better company would say there is more mileage more than 50 kmph,Suzuki
wonderful road grip and supper comfort scooty  for every riding.,Suzuki
working. The handling and control is good and it is reliability. The scooter Suzuki access is good looking and its design,Suzuki
"workshop , they are giving irresponsible answers.. and they are not at all replacing my battery from a month. Their service is very poor and they are not giving proper reply... We lost our good feel and belief  on Suzuki Vehicles. Please look into the issue and resolve it immediately.",Suzuki
yes it is reliable for indian road easy riding nice handle comfort grip nice milometer idicators and head light,Suzuki
"yes its very probity dontwoory, road grip is awesome we you are going with 80 speed but when you dispose break in above 80 speed you will fill that bike is not in our control but this bike is awesome",Suzuki
yet there are so many features which are good and bad. but according to me I will not suggest anyone to buy it.,Suzuki
"you can fill max 5- 6 litres, where as it gives less than 25 mileage",Suzuki
"you want to buy a scooter, then you should definitely take this scooter.",Suzuki
{susuki.}....plus the company say the average is 60km.....its all none sense I asked my friends n relative they told me that the bike give average only 35 to 40 km....,Suzuki
"• HEIGHT - As my mother is not very tall, she has a average height and feels that the scooter is to high for average people. The handlebar and the seats are placed very high.",Suzuki
"• LOOKS AND DESIGN - This scooter is very ugly. I literally doesn't take it out anywhere except in my area. The design is very ugly, mainly the headlamp. The headlamp is like a dumb box.",Suzuki
• MILEAGE - According to 125cc engine the mileage of the scooter is very bad. It gives an average mileage of only 25-30 kilometres per litre.  This is not at all sufficient. Even a 200cc motorcycle has more mileage.,Suzuki
"I purchased this bike moto gp edition on nov 8, 2019 and very happy with the performance. The engine is very smooth and refined and giving a decent average of 45 but certainly it lacks some power as compared to other bikes of same segment . Positive - mileage, comfort, smooth and sports bike feeling Negative - not sports bike performance although.",Suzuki
"Worth the price. Good sporty looking. The position is not much aggressive but good enough. I used this bike for daily commuting and sometimes for long rides., I don't feel any back problem. even if I ride continuously for 120-150 kms (without stop).But the problem is the pillion comfort which is not good.  In continuous ride the engine has heating issues. The main negative thing is gear shifting. You have to lubricate the gear for every ride. Please don't try to ride this bike without shoes or wearing flip-flops especially in city traffic..Cons : 1.Gear shifting is too hard2.Little heating issues in long rides (not much noticeable but it's heating up in continuous ride)3.Pillion comfort not much great (but trust me it's better than R15 v3 , KTM  Duke )4.Need some more power.Pros: 1. Price 2. Looks (sporty)3.Riding position (not much aggressive, helps for long ride)4.Millage (so much better than competitors in this segment)5.Looks stylish 6.Very good for daily commuting and short long rides 7.Worth of money.",Suzuki
150 cc Suzuki Gixxer is better than 125 duke. Suzuki Gixxer brake system is very poor. Suzuki Gixxer body metal quality it's poor. So I personal experience is don't buy this bike please. I requested to Suzuki please improve the brake system of this bike and engine quality.,Suzuki
"1.Buying experience-very nice to buy this bike...Mostly of its fi system...Fuel injection system is the one of the smartest system in this bike ..2.Riding experience - one of the best exp i am having.3.Details about looks, performance etc. Bike Servicing and maintenance-5* bike....I am also giving 5*4.Its an very great bike.",Suzuki
"Don't believe in any negative reviews. To be very honest the most comfortable bike with classy look suitable both for city and long rides, mileage is around 47 km/l in city and 54 km/l on highway. I accept it that it's little underpowered but you are not going to feel it under power. Braking system is really awesome. Its worth buying if you are looking for comfortable sports bike . ",Suzuki
Suzuki gixxer bike has a complete comfortable bike ever Main point it's average In 150 cc segment no any other bike average is 55-58 But my gixxers average is 55-58 regularly.Than its pickup is best 0-100 in i drive on my self in only 4-4.5 second.And top speed is 125 km on narol highway road.It is best in 150 cc segment because of its average. And abs model is awesome.,Suzuki
"Buying expensive is great, they offered me a test ride and also well explained all tech specs. Riding was pretty easy in the city. Main advantage of this bike is it looks bulky and heavy sports bike but it feels light while riding in the city. Not a very powerful engine but doesn't lack on the torque when it needed. Servicing and maintenance can save your pockets ;) with great mileage. Pros: design and looks smooth engine suspension Cons: a bit lack of powerful engine.",Suzuki
"The bike is the best bike in this segment, but it is getting overpriced day by day,  Don't compare it with R15, it s 13.9bhp bike, costing around 1.5 lac. NS 200, Pulsar 220 is priced lesser than this, but the bike is a very good but the previous handlebar of this bike is better than the current one.",Suzuki
"Suzuki Gixxer sf150  is worst bike, I bought this bike 7 months before  and I am driving at 10000 thousand kms. Engine over heats and tension problem over noise on engine head arises. Anybody don't buy this bike don't waste of money  i did 3 service in 6 month  I maintain my bike with proper maintenance   but has a worst engine, worst service. Heavy noise on head.",Suzuki
Very good for city and tour rideI want to buy this bike as soon as possible.Love this bike. Too good .Good for city and highway ride.,Suzuki
"Buying experience in good. I like to drive for long distances in this bike and its fully comfortable. Full safety is there on this bike but some minor problem is there. It has low weight, high power transmission with disc. Accurate date and kilometre reading.",Suzuki
"2.Riding experience is well smooth driving and millage is good but bike gears is very hard. Bike looks is very good,i am buying six months back i am satisfy and amazing.The suzuki gixxer sf (gsx-150f) is a 154.9 cc (9.45 cu in) fully faired motorcycle from suzuki. The bike was launched in 2014. Its design is inspired by the gsx-r1000, and the mighty suzuki hayabusa. In fact the fairing of the motorcycle is tested in the same tunnel that they test gsxr and hayabusa's fairing. The motogp edition also comes with fuel injection.",Suzuki
Awesome bike so comfortable and looks like super bike with premium feel.  Aerodynamics are so much better. Among Xtreme 200s 160r classic 350 fz 150 is an awesome bike so comfortable and looks like super bike with premium felling.,Suzuki
"I bought this bike in august 2019. Then only after its first service, i took him on a long ride and i traveled 500 km in 9 hours even though the engine did not have much of a heat. There was no such problem. It's very good bike for long ride and daily use. The handle bar of this bike is look good and ease for handling.",Suzuki
Best bike for everyday use. Good mid-range torque. Fun to ride. Mileage of gixxer is 50 if you ride on between 40 to 80 kmph. After service cost is very low. High road stability is  awesome. I love the bike. Always change engine oil when the time come  and lube and clear the chain and look for tyre pressure is normal. Then this bike is giving you great millage and stability.,Suzuki
It was a great experience buying this bike. It's too comfortable for riding in city and in highway also. Whenever you go around the urban areas all people will give a glance at this bike for its detailed look which is really a compact design overall. If i say about the engine performance then I will directly say once and for all that this bike will give you a good budget sports bike vibe with it's good mileage. All suzuki bikes are easy to give proper servicing and maintenance in a good price. So without any tension this time saving maintenance service will give anyone a great road trip within their schedule. But I really feel as a con this bike should had have 6 speed gear box and overall this is a packed machine for all kinds of buyers.,Suzuki
"The bike is lowest prices and superb sports bike feel in the bike,top speed is 110 mileage city of 45 highway 55 fantastic capacity and this bike drive with smooth riding feel was  like i am riding sports bike, the pillion rider sitting is comfortable and driver long drive distance not feeling back pain.",Suzuki
"Firstly, being a Suzuki is tough & we are fortunate enough to get a refined engine at this 155cc category. Vehicle Dynamics are good in terms of stability & Handling. Look wise its a premium sports tourer giving a feel of big bike. Yes, it lacks power & it's a concern as being a 155cc should have 15 - 17 bhp power. A big visor is also a must to improve its aerodynamics at high speeds else its a bang on product.",Suzuki
I'm loving this suzuki gixxer sf bike because main thing i like its suspension. It is comfortable for me while driving. Speed also superb and maximum time i'm outing in the bike. Main thing disc brake it is not comparable to others. It works super.Its looks also like a racing bike and colour combination too good.Overall i love this bike so much.,Suzuki
"Very amazing bike and nice ride, I am very excited to buy this bike, very comfortable seats with hot led lights, I am very happy to buy this bike.",Suzuki
"Value for money bike...Good mileage, great pillion comfort, rider comfort, powerful leds, refined engine, perfect build quality....No heating issues even in long rides and heavy traffic.Good muscular and sporty looks made it eye-catchy. One can definitely go for it.",Suzuki
Its a superb bike in at low cost .Stylish look updated electronic  and abs.  Suitable for both riding and adventure.  Love this  also one thing is important that back seat is also comfortable to seat and easy to get up . Yeah its my girl friends opinion . If you guys want to buy any racer bike this suzuki sf will definitely give you a surprise.,Suzuki
One of the best bike in this price range if you want an bike with sports model and with more comfort you can go with this bike blindly it is very much comfort in city rides and for long ride if your max speed is 80-100 then this bike gives its best performance if you are searching for an bike for racing then go with others this bike has less power but for other than racing this bike OP.,Suzuki
Best engine bike in this segment.Most important thing is it's smoothness.I ride this bike for long route too for almost 500 km in one day.Not a single issue face in my whole journey. Thanks to suzuki Only cons is that bike must have both abs.Service cost is also reasonable.This bike is totally head turner Awesome in look and easy to operate in heavy traffic too,Suzuki
"1.Buying experience is good 2.Riding experience is awesome too much comfortable for long drive 3.Looks is awesome superb but if we talk about  the performance, ""it's good but engine power is a less than our expectations. ""4. Servicing and maintenance is not too much high , it's under our pocket easily. 5. Pros and cons is also satisfactory In this range, this bike is one of the best bikes.",Suzuki
"I very happy with this bike and looks also good and comfortable and good milage 45 kmpl but in terms of performance need improvement after reaching a speed of 60 ignition sounds bad not ok in this other than everything is good, pillion seating not much comfortable need to be implemented on this also",Suzuki
1. Buying experience was pretty smooth.2. Riding exp: please don't quote me on this but this bike is not made for touring (obviously). It is really fun to ride motorcycle. Cornering is butter smooth. Suspension are set on stiffer side and you will feel the road pothole by pothole. For small city rides or occasional touring is fun but due to stiffer suspension and semi aggressive riding posture it will not be very comfortable ride.3. Looks: man this is definitely attention grabber. As it is not very commonly sold bike in this price segment you will rarely spot her but people just stalk the bike like some beauty queen. Performance midrange is fun. Till 100kmph. You will feel lack of power on highways.4. Service: servicing cost is average but my service center experience was not good. They barely know the stuff and misses on 90% of the stuff mentioned as per user manual service catalogue. Find good mechanic.5. Pros : fun to ride in city. Attention grabber. Good brakes. Exceptional handling. Cons: pillion's but will go missing after short ride. Engine tend to heat up in traffic and that do impact performance. Not comfortable for long ride if you want to save you butt.,Suzuki
Worst bike i ever seen. Its costs 1.52 but it does not worth that much of cost. While driving through wind air it doesn't go @60kmph.its very horrible while going doubles .disk breaks is not that much of 220f. In this rate you can go for 220 or royal enfiled or rs200. But mileage is good 40-43....,Suzuki
The bike is very comfortable and smooth. I have ride on it very bad road but still its give me the best service. And the mileage is very satisfactory which is most important to us.Seating of bike very comfortable.Weekly once l have ride on it for long ride around 300km. The looks of the bike is awesome. My dream bike.,Suzuki
Amazing performance. Value of money and also it's look is very hot. I am finally decided to buy doubled qualities mast then other bikes mileage is also good it have 155 cc engine 13.4 bhp power and the best thing is its maintenance is very long i think it is the best bike for me i really like it and i hope you will also like because the colour is very beautiful.,Suzuki
"I have owned this beast about 6 years ,i called my bike gixi , my gixi giving 45 kmpl mileage , maintenance cost around 1000 rupees for every 6 month and in 6 years there's no problem found into the engine. Next year if i have money in my hand then again i want to go for a new model of gixxer sf 154.90 cc.",Suzuki
"Bike is really good, very much smooth engine. Only problem is with indicators, in my bike with in a year, 2 indicators came out automatically. Fuel average of the bike is good. Fi technology works perfectly fine. Gear shift could be better. Headlight is not good for highways. You can touch 100km/h easily but after that engine makes lots of vibration.",Suzuki
This suzuki gixxer sf is very good looking bike i ever see in this price . Nice features and every thing in this bike is very good . only one negative point is their engine .This bike want oil cold or liquid cold engine for better experience .I personally like this bike so much. Engine quality mirrors tyres seating comfort are nice .,Suzuki
"Engine doesn't rev high (max 8000rpm) which is not good for a sports bike . Feels low powered on highway .Lack of 6th gear is a big disadvantage . Low performance for a sports bike. Front look is quite out dated , you will feel big wind blast . I suggest you to go for gixxer (without fairing) because it is 6 kg lighter ,looks are also good , and it is very good for daily commute and highway. Think practically while you buy this bike .",Suzuki
"This bike is awesome look. Perfect riding full money covers when buy this bike. Everything is good. No any doubt in this bike when i drive this bike, i feel awesome.  Low price and bike look like racing bike. But this bike not for racing and long rout. Just for daily uses.. If you need for long rout then suzuki gixxer sf 250 is perfect bike.",Suzuki
The bike good for the bs4 price not good price for bs6. I think it's high and performance is good enough and comfortable is well as compared to other full faring bikes the problem is always noise coming in front disc while braking and front suspension spring noise is coming and while you cruse at high speed the bike engine sounds like much tension and handle bar wobbling at higher speed other than the bike good for tour and daily ride and mileage is normal 40-45kmpl sometimes rarely it gives 38kmpl not always but claim mileage is 50-55kmpl.,Suzuki
"At first, i had an idea of buying a r15, as it is good in performance. Basically, i love faired bikes. When i come to know that it gives a back & wrist pain when we ride the bike more than 30km & it is very hard for Indian ladies to sit in pillion seat as they mostly wear saree. Hence i decided to buy a commuter bike with good mileage, comfort, handling and with good looks, which should be a faired bike at a reasonable price. At the end, suzuki's gixxer sf satisfied all my requirements. Hence i took delivery of the gixxer sf motogp edition on november 6 (writing this review on november 17[11 days experience]). I didn't even completed my first service, i completed 350 km in my bike. I just love this bike, it is good in handling while riding in traffic in cities, for me it is giving a mileage of 45km in city. A guy whom i known too owns the bs4 model of this bike. He said that it will give a mileage of 50 to 55 km on cities & 60+ kms on highway after first service. Even though it just have a air filter, it never gives much heat as it has a jet cooling technology. By the way, braking is awesome. It has just a single channel abs, i think its enough for a 155cc bike. Motogp colour of this bike is eye-catchy one. While i ride the bike on the street or city or my college, everyone at least give a look or stare at my bike for few seconds. This bike is a fun to ride bike, if you ride without pillion mostly. Pillion seat comfort is good, we can adjust. This bike gives a comfortable seating position. The seat is nor aggressive neither up straight, it give little bit leaning straight position, which is really comfortable. It has 9 led in front, but it has only halogen indicates. Can easily a reach a top speed of 128 & 133 if you hardly rev it. The instrumental console has all the needy features like gear indicator, trip meter, clock, fuel indicator, speedometer, rpm indicator, etc. You can set your warning limit for rpm. The smooth sound of the bike is like riding a car. In cars you won't hear much sound of the engine, the sound will be smooth to hear. This bike is also rides smooth & also smooth while riding in sudden grooves on road. The mirror of the bike is wide, there are more chances of breaking your mirror on traffics, but still you can fold your mirrors in non-needy places. The tyres never skid even in rainy days. I just have 11 days experience but this is rainy season here. You can solidly cruise at 90 to 100kmph. There are very minimal vibrations until 120kmph. No other bike has this much little vibrations under 1.5 lakh segment. The on-road price of this bike is 149k, which is little expensive for this bike. But i bought this bike for 144k in a offer. They should have given a big visor, when we cross 100kmph, we may feel a heavy amount of air pushing us backward, but you can change the visor with after market parts available on online. If you need a more good look, you can add the winglet of r15 in the front of the bike. Totally it is excellent bike. You will never regret after buying it. Always wear riding gears & have a safe ride, cheers!",Suzuki
"This is a good bike.Its good and comfortable to ride on it.It has a stunning design and is very attractive.It is a fully faired motorcycle.It gives us enough power when we ride.Vibrations are less when compared to the older version.As a safety feature it has Single-Channel ABS as standard and has a 155cc Fuel Injected(FI)-Engine which is Air-Cooled.Compared with the old model it has an increased seat height (795mm)which is a bit disappointed for shorter riders.They didn't put Dual-Channel ABS as the R15-V3 has it.It gives a good mileage around 40-45Km/L.Overall it is a good bike.It has a good price of Rs1.1 lakhs(showroom) and has a good value for money. If you are a beginner and is planning to take a new bike,I recommend you to buy this.",Suzuki
My dream bike.Totally loved the experience of buying from booking to delivery. Suzuki dealership in my city was very co operative.The bike is awesome & people just stare at the bike asking for info .I personally love the silver metallic colour & got it at 1.35 lakh bs4. It's totally vfm while i think the bs6 gets a price bump due to its appeal.Suzuki has done a great job with this bike .Love gixxer sf.,Suzuki
"Awesome bike ever,  best for long rides, Compere with r15  gixxer is super for long ride, full comfortable ride, riding position is superb, one day I ride 770 kms Puttur to Sirsi and return to Sirsi to Puttur, Gixxer SF no vibrations no engine problems continuously I ride 388km its awesome journey and its maintenance is very easy and best and other 155 segment bikes like Pulsar r15, apache and etc are give 38 to 45 mileage but gixxer sf is giving 50 to 52 mileage in highway city limits its give 46 to 48.Gixxer sf look is awesome and I love suzuki gixxer service center In sirsi name is KELLA SUZUKI SIRSI Awesome experience with dealer and there service, you want look, mileage maintenance, free comfortable long rides you can go for Gixxer sf, its best pocket friendly fuel eficiant bike.",Suzuki
"1.Buying experience is good. Due to less service centre you will the major issue.2. Riding experience is not good low pick up when you rev the you will feel that engine is stressed.3. Look is wonderful. Performance is bad. 4. Service average Maintenance is high material quality is bad.5. Pros - full faring bike, look very good, mileage is good. Cons- poor engine, material quality used is low. Poor pick up, price is very high according to bike quality and performance.",Suzuki
"This bike has the following things better than its rivals full fairing and mileageAnd that's it.the rtr 200 has slipper clutch, dual abs, better instrument console with tons of features and gtt techNs200 has amazing top endThis bike costing 1.60 lakh in Bangalore really is overrated and overpriced with people also complaining about very hard gear shifts Really ask yourself how it will be if a ns200 or rtr200 that costs lesser overtakes and i am pretty sure this bike will never catch up.There is only so much that you can do with good looks, bike looks stunning but lacks performance, go for ns or rtr 200 or the 160's, r15 if you've got the budget.",Suzuki
It's a very good bike Performance is superb Very smooth bike Reliable. No vibration even in high rpms. Throttle response is superb in every gears But What i don't like about my bike is Ground clearance it scrapes in every speedbraker &the headlight power is very low & the gearshift is very hard from the day i brought Other than that the bike is superb.,Suzuki
"Nice bike rating 5/51 suzuki gixxer sf 155cc i'm using last 3 year 2  top speed 125km3 looks super blue motogp version nice4 maintenance  good 2500km. For beginners this bike good it, you feel very comfortable then other sports bike. There is no vibration tubeless tyre ,both front and rear, battery condition  good totally  this bike for choose.",Suzuki
Price wise its good as there competitor in this price range but its better to go for r14. Service by all the showroom is pathetic...It doesn't have enough power. Suzuki should work on there after sales service.   Its painful...Plus parts are not available easily..Mirror of bike is most ugly looking thing. I installed after market rear view mirrors.,Suzuki
Bike is Very Smooth Price is Little bit high but you will satisfied with that bike. Mileage is around 48-49 in city and 50-52 highway overall good package. power is enough not good but okay for daily commute. service cost also low. And refined engine gives you positivity while riding bike handling and cornering is top notch.. Tyre are also best and provides superb road grip I'm riding from one month and no issue I faced from it. its very value for money.,Suzuki
"Hi, I am using sf bs4 model black. I am using from 2 years overall bike is good regarding speed going upon 125 and lights are good and horn sound is less better to change to pulsar horn and if you want to keep safety rods I won't work like yamaha brakes are not good and if possible suzuki should provide dual channel abs for better grip and mileage. it's giving 40 most sports bike won't give but in terms of mileage good for 1st year brakes will be good but from second year we need to change the disc except brakes all are good. Maintenance will be around 800- 1500. Riding experience will good but suzuki should change visor to large when ever we go to highway it would be problem with visor.",Suzuki
I am using this since may 2015 and crossed 100000 km. So far I didn't face any engine issues or any major issues. Only major problem I got was that my rear suspension had broken at 80000 km. After that there was no problem until now. But the mileage they have mentioned in the comment list was not correct. It gives only 35 to 38 km in traffic and 40 km on highways.,Suzuki
"I purchased this bike few months ago. Still now I am not facing any major issues but in my opinion some more features should be available in this bike like-side stand engine cut off, double indicators, frame slider installation option, usb charging port etc. but still it's offer you much, you can definitely buy this machine, if you are searching for a sports bike with good sitting position and more comfortable this bike is for you. Go for it",Suzuki
"Amazing bike for bike lovers. You guys enjoy to ride, a must buy. Test it out if interested, then find out why I'm recommending you. But there was a problem. When I bought this it was time of  BS4 to BS6. At that time the shop from where I bought this Gixxer was closed and I didn't have the paper for it.. When I insisted they told me that if you do something then do it. we won't give you the paper..Then after some time the shop closed down.. Now I ride it without the number plate.. but love this bike, it's my love. I name it Sandy. just sharing my experience. thank u team Gixxer bike service.",Suzuki
This bike looks like very good but the plastics quality should be much better. Power should be higher it's too less for its looks It looks very powerful bike it's not. Acceleration is leaner not punchy.Top end and low end performance is very bad and gear shifting is too hard Pillion comfort good for short riding Mileage is good if you r driving under 60kmphr but if you driving 80 up mileage is so bad.,Suzuki

"First time i saw this bike i was impressed by its look.Then i moved over engine, it produces 14 hp but is fuel injected. You will get led lights,clip on handle bar,full fairing and much more features which makes it better bike than older model.I decided to buy this as my first bike and i am very happy.",Suzuki
"Bike is good, there are some issues like suspension is not much good even if i go in small road  and when we go in highway its good but the bike looks some slippery in rain roads and the gear system is good but when we go in 5th gear its hard to gear down in roads, some times i cant see gear indicator too and rest is good.",Suzuki
Its really amazing. It gave me an amazing awesome and cant tell how much cool and sexy is the bike. Very comfortable for bringing to top speed. Excellent acceleration Most important. Its look give a pleasure and whatever what is needed for a real men. It got nice mileage If i say about its price. Its nice and in the budget.,Suzuki

Mileage: yet to check(showroom people said in city traffic 45-50) Finally, i would suggest people who are willing to buy sports looks, brand and decent mileage bike go for it.",Suzuki
"I bought this bike from aryan suzuki, varthur road, bangalore. Staff are very good. They explained everything in good way and also help me in getting finance.Riding experience is very good. I didn't feel any vibration at all during my ride. You feel comfortable while riding. Style is more sporty as compare to old model. Specially i like the gear position, clip-on handle bar and split seat. Suzuki all bike come under low maintenance cost category if service your bike on time.Pros : best bike at this segment and to many other pros as mentioned above.Cons: suzuki spare part is not available in aftermarket. For small part also you have to go to the showroom.",Suzuki
"At Rs. 1.56 lakh rupees the Gixxer SF 150 like the best deal for me. If you are looking for a stunning, fully-faired motorcycle that doesn't trade for comfort, then the Gixxer should be your deal. This bike can perform your everyday city commute and be your companion for long weekend rides too. All in all, the Suzuki Gixxer SF 150 is a motorcycle that you should definitely consider if you want a stylish economical sports bike.",Suzuki
"1.Buying experience- It was good but the guys who are working in suzuki dealers are not that much experienced...so customers are facing servicing problems.2. Riding experience- if you want power then go for pulsar..this bike is stylish and attractive..power is okay time like yamaha fz. you want people's attention buy this bike.riding more than 80km/h is not that much good..3.Look and performance- look is fantastic...best stylish 150c bike.. performance is okay..sound is good... don't drive above 100km/h4.servicing and maintenance- This is the most important this for a suzuki motorcycle owner..now a days most of the mechanics working in suzuki are local and they don't know anything...They can destroy your bike..so do servicing at a known,good, popular suzuki mechanics... performance is good but  price is little bit high..but its better that fz. breaking is good...bike don't skid...rear brake is ok. i am getting mileage between 45-50km/l5. Pros- very stylish and attractive bike..log notice karenge tumhe...mileage is very good.. sitting posture is so good...you won't have pain...80km/h speed is bread and butter for this bike.6.cons-bike is overpriced around 8k..you will feel lack of power somehow.... after 100km/h the bike is waste...suzuki should focus on more stickers... there's no fuel mileage on the digital console..",Suzuki
"Awesome sports bike. Pros:Comfortable riding position - it is between normal commuter bike position and sports bike position good for taller riders, great mileage around 45-50km as they claimed. Attractive look except the front styling. Moderately priced - 1.31l is quite costly for a 150cc sports bike Cons:No abs in the rear disc. Fuel indicator not accurate. No ladies foot rest.",Suzuki
Its been 3 years when i purchased suzuki gixxer sf fi over other bikes such as avenger. It is a very good bike most imp thing is it is a sports tourer i have completed 13000 kms on it and no problems are faced by me. Just service it on time  and keep chain in good condition you can take it to ladakh also.,Suzuki
"The bike is amazing. riding posture is good. I have taken Test Ride of New Gixxer SF (2019).It is more stable on road compare to older gixxer SF, Because of Clip on bars. and power delivery is massive good. and it is look more aggressive than older one, with 10 units of LED headlamp, braking is much smoother than older one.It has Single channel ABS but it should have Dual Channel ABS.",Suzuki
"If you compromise a little bit of power so definitely go for that bike still this bike goes up to 130 kmph.. Millege is one of the biggest turning points get around 45 to 50 easily 1. Excellent refinement, 2. Comfortable riding posture, 3. Looks are great or fit & finish is very good.. 4. Headlight best in the segment..In the end, I'm fully satisfied with this bike..",Suzuki
"Suzuki bikes are worst, except scooters. Gixxar is a under powered bike and mileage will decrease after a while. And maintenance is ok, but spare parts are little expensive and hard to find.155cc bike have at least 14 to 15 hpBut it gets 13hp. And mileage will get 48kmpl at starting after 2 months or 4 months it give around 40, so worst bike ever. The thing to love about this bike is the tyres and just the looks",Suzuki
"1. Got the bike 2 days back and the purchasing process was smooth. 2. It's doesn't feel like 155 cc engine. It will feel somewhat like a 200 cc bike. The engine is very much refined and vibration free. It accelerates smoothly and is very stable at a higher speed. 3. Now about looks, simply the best in its segment as it feels like a bigger bike and much stylish as compared to the older variant.4. The only cons i felt is about the pillion seating comfort. The pillion seat is a bit hard and not easily reachable. I'm not complaining about it, but it could have been better.",Suzuki
"First i will start with my buying experience.Early i was going for royal enfield classic 350 black(both bikes are of different segment) and booked it by paying 5k to the showroom. And after 2 days suzuki launched the gixxer, I went to the showroom and saw the bike and i fell in love with its looks and style. Its completely different from the previous model. I asked them for a test ride but at that time they didn't have the test ride vehicle and said to wait for couple of days. After some days they called me for taking test ride and after taking the test ride i just went to RE showroom and cancelled my RE booking and booked the the gixxer 155. Suzuki showroom guys are very helpful in completing the process.Riding experience/looks/performance :Bike feels very planted and stable on roads. First thing you will notice when you take it outside is that people will stare at you and your bike,its eye catchy and will ask you kitne ki ai bhai. Road presence is just awesome. I feel that Seats are little hard but again you can add cushion to you seat cover to make it comfortable. Seating position is relaxed not too much sporty like r15. Breaks are good. I can't say much about the performance as i purchased it 5 days back so i will update you guys after the first service. Problems i am facing :1.Downshift is not proper. Every time I have to release clutch and press it again to downshift the gear. If I am in 5th gear and want to come to 2nd gear then press clutch Downshift one gear the release clutch and press it gain and the again Downshift... Like this i come to 2nd gear.. 2. Engine voice is changed after 60km continues ride ( can't say what happened before 1st service) but yes there is some sound from engine after it heats up. 3.  voice from abs motor. Its annoying. ktrrr ktrrr sound... To check it, apply main stand, switch on the ignition, rotate front wheel and apply front brakes hard. You will get to know what kind of sound i am talking about. Suggestion:Don't ride your bike above 4500rpm for first 800km.",Suzuki
"Bike's look is like a sporty type, or is it easy to make it as easy as it is, it is a great suspension that has long been a long way for me to travel it has a head light and its tail lamps are very popular. I have liked it personally, which is a reflection of which is wonderful. I enjoyed playing this bike.",Suzuki
Very good bike for daily commute mileage is very good I am getting mileage of 55km/l engine is so refined and maintenance cost is so low there are some minor disadvantages first visor is so bad and destroy the look of the bike and the second pillion seat is not comfortable and the bike is very underrated as it comes at a low price point.,Suzuki
i think this is one of the best design from suzuki for a 150 cc segment next to V3 from Yamaha.The fairing looks good and provides a sporty look with the clip on handlebars.Mechanical Specs can be improved 14 bhp for a bike of Rs.1.10 lakhs ex showroom is little bit higher with the air cooled engine in it.Suzuki should have made improvements in this section.In other terms it is a good daily commute with a sporty look and a economic mileage.,Suzuki
"Best bike in 150cc i have ever seen it is a best sporty looking bike and also the performance is very good, pick up and acceleration is very good and also it had slipper clutch, its free to reduce gear, no struggle on changing gears and the main thing to say about is the vva technology by this vva u will get good mileage on higher speed also it will boost up your engine twice as your engine speed.",Suzuki
The new  gixxer sf 155 is an amazing bike  which offered in a good price it consist of many features it have an155 single cylinder 2 valve air cooled engine with double disc brake consist of single channel  which give us mileage around 50 km/l which is perfectly suitable for our daily uses we can evan use it for over weakened rides.,Suzuki
This bike top model is costing 1.3 lac on road which is good we don't have any problem with it but if Suzuki is increasing price like this they should Upgrade the bike too.if I'm not wrong this is same Gixxer 13.9/14 bhp which is not expectable this bike is at least 16-17. bhp.power is disappointed me .my review Look-4.8/5                   Performance-5/5                   comfort -3.5/5                  Value for Money-0.5/5Go for Pulsar NS-200.,Suzuki
"This is a good bike.Its good and comfortable to ride on it.It has a stunning design and is very attractive.It is a fully faired motorcycle.It gives us enough power when we ride.Vibrations are less when compared to the older version.As a safety feature it has Single-Channel ABS as standard and has a 155cc Fuel Injected(FI)-Engine which is Air-Cooled.Compared with the old model it has an increased seat height (795mm)which is a bit disappointed for shorter riders.They didn't put Dual-Channel ABS as the R15-V3 has it.It gives a good mileage around 40-45Km/L.Overall it is a good bike.It has a good price of Rs1.1 lakhs(showroom) and has a good value for money.If you are a beginner and is planning to take a new bike,I recommend you to buy this.",Suzuki
This bike is awesome. Older gixxer sf next gen like 2.0.This is really good. Looks are different.The real sport machine . Comfortable seats.Luxurious rides.Night lights are clear powerful engines from capacity are awesome and its is beautiful bike to handsome guys .Super cool awesome bike. Go for it.,Suzuki
This a good and comfortable and stylish bike... Every youth have to try it. And breaking is also good... I like it very much... Hope every one who will ride this bike he will be happy for everything... My personal opinion is it's rock... I will go for 250 next time and the moto gp edition is amazing.,Suzuki
"It was gifted by me on my 26th birthday last year. So i have been using it almost 5 months. I mostly used for office purpose daily in city. But i have also completed 370 km in 2 days. In highway you feel less power but very comfortable, no problem found till now. In city ride it's awesome. Its a beast. Its gives me 45-50 km/l in city & in highway 52-55 km/l. But seriously it's fun to ride bike & it's look also gorgeous. Most of the people of the road will stair you when you will pass them. Very very refine & smooth engine ,no vibration till 110 km/r after that low vibration occurs. I stretched my gixxer till 127 km/r.",Suzuki
"My buying experience was too good ,i bought it from my home town Ranchi, me and my friends are enjoying this bike and riding is also good but not for log drive , looks and performance is good enough , servicing is also nice in Ranchi service centre. Pros - good price , good looks , good performanceCons - not for long drive , high cost maintenance.",Suzuki
"I have no bike. I had ridden my friend's bike, its comfortable.I want to purchase this bike because its better than others. It's mileage is very good also design is very well.Abs in this bike is best for secure riding.Due to this reason i love to buy suzuki gixxer sf. And i like its black colour. So i give 5 rating star.",Suzuki
"Both gixxer sf 155/250 is so underrated. I own a gixxer sf 155 and have ridden about 1500 km so far, this is what I felt about this bike. Quality: The build quality is pretty good, aerodynamics are at their best, the headlights are the best in the segment you won’t need custom lights, provides excellent reach and visibility even in pitch dark conditions.Engine:Performance is pretty average. Low-end punch is not there, top-end lags but mid-range performance is good. It’s not a peppy engine it’s more like a refined smooth engine. I did a top speed of 124, with a pillion 119. Seating comfort and handling:The seating posture is brilliant because it’s not too sporty, not upright, it’s well set. Pillion comfort is poor because the pillion seat is a bit taller set and it’s hard(caused butt aches). Handling is top-notch in this bike. Cornering abilities are decent.Mileage:(getting a mileage is subjective)City:40-47 (my avg:44)Highway:45-52 (my avg:49)Braking:The brakes are so good, the single-channel abs do their job pretty well. The rear brake is decent.Cons:•	it’s a bit expensive for what it offers. Lacks power (13.6ps only).•	 misses both sides stand indicator and sensor. •	pillion comfort is poor. The gearbox is a bit hard (should wear shoes or loafers instead of chappals).•	 visor is way too small(i changed mine in the aftermarket).Slight heating in heavy traffic conditions. •	resale value is lower than other bikes in this segment.Pros:•	looks stunning absolutely eye-catchy. •	quality levels are pretty good (never faced oil leak, sound from the fairing and other parts).•	the engine is butter smooth.•	great fuel efficiency. (always returns me a 45km per litre)•	handling is so good. Provides so much comfort for the rider(not for the pillion).•	flicking around traffic, taking a u-turn, and cruising at 70-85 km on highways were not a problem on this bike.•	aerodynamics is impressive (even though there are slight heating issues, it cools down very well by sucking the air from the gaps between fairing and sending it through over the engine). •	headlight looks cool and also has a widespread and provides excellent visibility(even at pitch dark).Verdict (my experience)I wanted a motorcycle under 1.5 lakhs. I don’t want to go over 160 cc because I wanted a good mileage. I wanted a bike that offers a decent performance with good build quality.These are the bikes in the budget that i considered and took a test drive and this is what i felt: 1.	Hero Xtreme 160 2.	Pulsar ns 160 3.	Apache 160 4v4.	 Suzuki gixxer sf  Hero xtreme 160 is the cost lot lesser out of the 4 I mentioned by a big margin. Performance is good. All led setup is eye-catchy. Quality is not good. The seat setup is poor and the pillion seat is the worst. My friends suggested not to buy this because it might get some issues in the future.Ns160 is a beast without a doubt it offers great performance and has an oil cooler at this price point which is amazing. Ns always have poor quality parts throughout which causes oil leaks, and rattling sounds from some parts (including the tank region). It is outdated.Apache 160 4v comes with a  lot of features and has an excellent performance. I am not a fan of its look and design but apparently, it offers everything that I asked for in a 160 cc bike. I am a tall person (6 feet) the only problem i had with this bike is that apache is suited for short and average riders. The legroom near the tank is very limited so i have to fold my legs hard which makes me uncomfortable to ride in the first place.Gixxer sf surprisingly suited my character and met my expectation so i bought it.",Suzuki
I'd bought the bike in sept 2017 so i m using this since last two years . From that experience i will say it has fantastic looks ...Seems so stylish its mileage is also good compared with other 150 cc bikes also it got good control and speed but you will feel lagged behind when it comes to top speed it will give about 115 also it has problem of gear shifting sound that's not smooth.,Suzuki
"So here comes the review of the new suzuki gixxer sf 2019 model.(take some time to read if you want to buy the bike) 1. Buying experience was good. Though i had to wait for a month to get the bike as i booked it before the launch but it was worth the wait i would say.  The sales department wasn't that too good i would say.2. Riding experience - it has quite upright posture. Its a balance between the rs 200 not too raised nor too aggressive like the r15 or rc's.  Seat for the rider is good and comfortable. Pillion seat isn't that comfortable and is hard to access for ladies and short riders. 3. Performance and looks - boy oh boy it's mind blowing. You have the torque which kicks in right from 3k rpm. Linear power delivery, will not scare you like d the ktms. Its absolutely fun riding it, i never stop enjoying it while riding. Now lets come to its look. Very stylish and aggressive, it's a head turner. Very nice led lights. But only lack is a taller wind screen it was really a much required thing.4. Servicing and maintenance - ok so here comes the reason why i hate suzuki so much. Their service is pathetic. But the bike it self is very good, but you need a good service to keep the bike in a good condition. Please suzuki increase the standards of the service.5. Pros - you get good performance and style at a reasonable price. The seating posture is good for a longer ride.  Led lights are just awesome and do have a very good performance in the city (though if you are into touring and in pitch dark conditions you do need extra lights for high speed cruising).  Mileage is good which i get is around 45. Instrument console is the best in the segment is what i think.Cons - worst is the service. 0/10. Rear brakes could be a bit better. The fuel indicator isn't properly accurate, it does have some fault(not a major one though). The front suspension is a bit hard, you are going to have a hard time and over bad roads.  A taller windshield was needed.",Suzuki
"Gixxer sf 155 is done his job nicely, it’s a good commuter bike with good sport fairing and very attractive eye catchy.I get 50kmpl mileage normally and 55+ kmpl mileage on highway.According to price and 155 cc this is good but sometimes feel low top end performance.Suzuki needs to improve engine for sure !!",Suzuki
"1. Buying experience when I was planning to get this bike I had options like r15 and apache rtr 2004v . So I went to the showroom of both the tvs and yamaha . Took the test ride of both. Comfort in r15 was not as I expected it to be. On the other hand apache was comfortable but certainly not as refined as other japanese bikes. So I booked the bike without any doubt my top priority was comfort and refinement. 2. Riding experienceYou can feel a bit of vibration at the higher rpm's but you know we don't need to ride on higher rpm's on the Indian roads. It's not a deal-breaker. The riding experience was smooth, refined, and gives you sufficient power to glide through the traffic. 3. Looks of this motorcycleLooks are totally subjective and I can say I found gixxer sf 150 more eye-catchy and appealing than its rivals. Why? because it's unique in its segment you won't see people on gixxer everywhere since they are just looking for power and more torque. The headlights are mean and aggressive and yet it's comfortable to ride 4. Servicing and maintenanceIn this part, I rather say it costs a bit more as compared to our own Indian brands but it's worth every penny. And maintenance is not an everyday task if you genuinely care about your vehicle then you'll eventually take care of her no doubt that. It's easy to maintain in the end.5 . Pros : 1. It has a big muscular aggressive profile2. Gives you mileage around 40-45 in city commuting3. Refinement level is top-notch4. Unique because only practical buyers buy the gixxer sf 1505. It has a gear position indicator ( i know it's a normal thing but come on some companies still don't know how to give that) Cons : 1. It is slightly underpowered2. Switch quality needs improvement3. Gears are pretty hard and clutch too I don't know if it's only my unit but it feels hard wasn't expecting that from suzuki need a big upgrade on that4. Faced some rusting issues in the inner parts after driving 5000 kmConclusion:  if you are looking for a practical 150cc bike that is fully faired gives you a vibe of a faired motorcycle and needs the smoothness of Japanese engine then this one is for you. Just keep in mind the points that I've mentioned in my review. Thank you, ride safe",Suzuki
1. My first bike that's why first experience..... I can't explain 2. Very good experience after driving this bike 3. Look was awesome and dashing and performance are awesome with looks 4. Servicing not much high ok 5. Pros - everything is good Cons- 2017 i purchase suzuki gixxer sf ( f/r disc) blue but 2019 comes with more attractive looks.,Suzuki
"The buying experience was normal for me, I actually went to buy sf 250 but 250 was not available at that time and they said it will take 3 months time and I needed a bike urgently so had to go wid sf, riding experience is really good and comfy, it gives a hell lot of confidence in corners just need to change those tyre.Bs6 version feels really smooth just has minor vibes around 5,000 rpm, performance is great as a 155 cc has a peppy engine which is great if you do not have a power-hunger in 155 cc but you only demand comfort and a big bike feel then this is one of the best options. Pros provide great mileage if you ride it normally has the great visual appearance, I know suzuki will provide 6 gears in it so gear ratio should be increased,2nd gear is too short, 5-speed gearbox is fine in city use but gear ratio should be tweaked in each gear (stock gears 1st - 42,2nd -68,3rd-90,4th-108,5th-120+) I want this machine gears to be like (1st -49,2nd-76,3rd-96,4th-118,5th-130+).",Suzuki
"Mileage only 35 to 40 kmpl, bhp 14 only when using 5th gear. No good pickup. Poor front and back seating. Good for riding on highway at high speeds. Average breaking, not suitable for daily use. Looks are awesome. Only 5 gears. Need 6 gears for good speed. Led light not suitable for street riders because opposite riders can not see properly. Better to buy a scooter instead of buying a big amount bike. Because scooter can easily chase this bike on traffic roads and also scooter is giving good mileage and good pickup and no need of shifting gears up and down always.",Suzuki
"It was gifted by my dad on my birthday in 2021. So, it was bought in apple suzuki showroom, outer ring road, banashankari 3rd stage, Bengaluru. Talking about the riding experience, riding this from past 6-7 months have given me immense joy and i am impressed with the power of the bike. In Bengaluru city you can ride maximum up-to 40-60 km/hr. (if the road is empty and smooth). It also gives a good mileage of 40-45 km/l. All other /aspects while riding is good.I liked the sporty look of the bike, having 155cc, it is gives a good performance. I have the bike in black and it gives a separate look as compared to other colours.",Suzuki
Best bike in Indian market compared to any other brand bikes companyGo far it Best milage.Deep base sound.130kimi speed.A super lovely look.Super led hed light.Attractive tale backlight.Best handlebar.Comfortable pillion seat.Smooth suspension.Abs braking system.Dual disk brake.Avrage looking very sooper,Suzuki
Greatest 150cc for beginners.The riding quality is too much comfortableFully faired bike with an aggressive look.The built quality is very good.Mileage is also very good in the city.Power is not too much but performance is 10 out of 10.The exhaust note is very punchy.Smooth engine.And the brakes are really very nice.Only missing thing in this bike is dual abs and 6th gear.. this is available only in the single abs standard version.. but the rear brake is also very good .overall 9.5/10.,Suzuki
"I was a scooter rider, now after riding the gixxer sf 2019 155, the bike seems very well built, good power, impressive design, great braking. A little bit aggressive, after all its a sports bike, and a bit heavy. Very good handling , nice headlight , wonderful real lights. Good mileage with sports look. Good balance between sporty and commuter.",Suzuki
"I can buy for gixxer sf  model for highway crushing and daily commuting but can'd expect this much of mileage when crushing in highway exactly in 7000 rpm it will touch 100 kmpl without any  any engine stress but discomfort for pillion rider suzuki improve it spare parts or cheaper , sadly i hate engine noise and gear ratio of the bike.",Suzuki
"Loved the side looks of the bike, so I bought it. But it has been a very painful journey throughout. Within a year it developed abs problems, one year and a month later battery problems, and now after 2 years headlight went off(led unit). The bike was maintained very well with regular services and 0 crashes or drops. This proves that trash components are used in the manufacturing process. I will advise people against buying a suzuki motorcycle in India. Service guys know very little. They will replace everything as they don't know how to repair it. And so many problems within 2-3 years are not justified for the price you pay mentally and financially. No doubt their sales are dropping. Spend your money elsewhere if it is hard-earned for peace of mind.",Suzuki
It has good fuel efficiency with good mileage the engine is also good and it has 131 top speed without any coolant or ac in it so personally i liked it very much in comparing to others and it is affordable too as it is not much expensive so i'll prefer everyone to buy suzuki bikes because of the materials!,Suzuki
1.Buying experience -For 150 cc segment looking wise suzuki gixxer sf very attractive. This is for the reason to become choosing this bike.2.Riding experience Over all mileage was pretty good for this bike & rider sheet very comfort for long drive .Engine slidely become heat for long drive.Not comport for co driver sheet - feel pain for 40 to 50 km3. Looks & performance 1) looks: Looks  wise i give 4.5/5 but build quality in this bike very poor. There is no safety measures in this bike. 2)performance A) breaking -4.5/5B) engine noise-4.5/5C) rider comfort-4/5D) city ride-4/5E) long drive-4/5 Over all performance wise in this bike slidely good we lag in maintenance 4) servicing and maintaining 2/5 We need to check the engine oil every  2000 to 2500 km once *engine oil leakage problems not solvable *maintaining cost slidely high to be compare other motor cycles in this Segment .We need to pay the double for the bike cost. We've to very careful for bike service records there is no proper maintaining records if you not checking there is no entry put in your bike in system so please check every service your bike system records -this is yous full for engine warranty Over all. This bike was very good but suzuki lag in after sale service. The service centers not available experience persons every time the persons change & they are thinking about cost benefits only .If we place any compliant we need to change new parts only we not get solutions about that. I totally disappointed suzuki after sale service i am not satisfied their service. 5)pros and cons. Pros A) looking wise very good B) smooth engine C) good mileage Cons A) after sale service very bad B) gear very hard C) high maintenance cost D) low ground clearance E) poor build quality.,Suzuki
"Worst bike ever. It's been only 15 days and I'm facing lot of issues. Out of the blues, the bike doesn't even start, and had to manually walk the bike total of 5 times including today. Went to the service center and I was told that the battery is damaged. What? did the battery get damaged in 25 days? replaced battery yesterday and today also bike didn't start.  Went to the service center again and I was told that there was some wiring issue and this needs a kit replacement. And guess what, I have to pay 7000 from my own pockets. That's all happened in 15 days. Worst bike ever. Avoid at any costs. Even their service center staff is unprofessional. I badly want to get rid of this bike. Worst purchase ever of my life!",Suzuki
"I bought the 2019 edition of gixxer sf for 1,10,000/- rs. The bike was super comfortable to ride even a pillion comfort was amazing, and decent mileage for 2 years. But it has tremendous issues with poor wires, the clutch was replaced every 6 months, too much heating issue, every electronic part was cheap, headlight beams don't properly guide you on the dark road because beams are not falling on the road, rpm gets high automatically whenever you come back from a long ride.",Suzuki
"The buying experience was a very good thing, I was not believing that I am going to buy it, showroom people make it good.This is the bike where I learned how to ride,The bike has good acceleration and looks very good, lot of people look at this bike and ask which bike as very few know it.Performance is good for a 155 cc bike, Pros are looks, pickup, and efficiency.Cons side stand switch and mileage indicator not present.",Suzuki
Best budget-friendly sports bike. Suits for city as well as highway. Parents can easily sit in pillion seats with sarees. Good mileage. But the disadvantage lags speed sometimes and there is no 6th gear. And disadvantages Bluetooth and gps connectivity. Best for students who want to buy a sports bike. Nice finishing. I would like to add the suzuki symbol in a bold highlighted manner as Yamaha put on them.,Suzuki
"This is a bike you can use in local ride , long ride , touring in short everything. I tried it to day , this is awesome , handel's are in perfect position. No back pain / no wrist pain / no problems...Dual channel abs is standard so safety is no longer compromised. In short whatever suzuki is not giving i don't need that but what they are giving i am happy in this price tag....",Suzuki
I love to ride my bike Gixxer Sf sp. I will be happy to give 5 stars but the problem is the bike is shaking while Pick-up the bike and shift up gear 3 to 4 to 5. I told the service centre but they told me every Gixxer bike has this problem. So maybe this is a manufacturer defect. Suzuki should solve this problem. Thank you.,Suzuki
"The dealership experience was absolutely amazing! loved it. Riding the bike is thrill, every time you turn the key to ignition and put the bike in first gear, she's all set for take off! i peaked the bike at 130 km/h. The bike i have black  from the way the gunmetal shines to the way the red accent runs here and there, she's adorable in every way! tremendous amount of cost cutting has been done for the Indian market because our market has the most stupid mindset, in order to maintain sales, cost cutting has been done. Coming down to the servicing, it's very very economical. Including the free service coupons ( 3 services done so far).Costs roughly 800 rs only hands down. She's pretty easy to maintain, not costly at all after being a sports bike.. Parts are cheap are as well. Talking now about the pros :-- worth every single buck spent- power delivery will never bore you, be it any gear- abs is very reliable, saved my ass multiple times- lot to offer for a mere price tag of 1.6l- easy to maintain, spare parts won't burn a hole in the pocket- eye grabber, absolute chick magnet xd- ergonomic, no back pain or wrist pain, however a little adjustment of handle is required. Just a little.- tyre are wide and trustable, lean her with confidence!- average, the question of the matter, the engine on this one is amazingly refined, susuki has done it.",Suzuki
"Am buy this bike only seven months(13100km)the engine started too much noise and gave to service in thrissur indel suzuki manager told me you never get warranty service for this vehicle very bad experience suzuki, i will never recommend this bike for who may know.",Suzuki
1. Buying experience is good. They want me to be happy and make my satisfaction. 2. Riding experience is excellent 3. Details about looks- it looks great for me and it is my dream who do come true after owning this super bike.  Performance is not that bad in which pickup is little bit late or slow.  4. I don't have any experience in servicing so no ideas. 5. Pros and cons No cons in this bike rather pros for everyone who would like to buy. The advantage of this bike is like walking in the sand.,Suzuki
awesome bike. suzuki please focus on visor.visor is the only problem in the bike.otherwise performance okay breaks really good. fairing fittings excellent. head light is very bright while headlight in on unable to see the bike.if you want a good looking bike with good mileage suzuki is the best option.,Suzuki
"No doubt, bike looks awesome, clear finishing.. Best performance under in 150cc segment... Comfortable riding...For beginners, some may feel discomfort for a week then you will get used to it, you feel very comfortable then other sports bike.   There is no vibration at all.. But the problem is bike wobbles a bit at 80 to 90 kmph only when your not holding your handle bar.",Suzuki
I am going to buy suzuki gixxer sf on jan 2020. This bike look sporty look and moto gp edition also available and clip handled bar so its completely we get good sports bike look.And the price also comfortable. We get split seats and led head lights. And we get good mileage. We get 40 to 45 in local 45 to 50 in highways.,Suzuki
So i want to start with the looks of this bike. It has got a very nice bulky body with good quality fairing. The glossy black colour is my personal favourite. And riding experience of this bike is also very good as it's seats are comfortable. It has a low cost service and maintenance which makes it budget friendly .It has very good mileage around 48-50 km/l.,Suzuki
"Buying experience are good but riding experience are really awesome ,enjoying ride because this bike are perfect for me because current student and i have daily up down in college and coaching very comfortable with sporty look . Thank for bike wale for review and compare this bike and also thank my daddy he bought this bike.",Suzuki
"To start with the buying experience, the staff were very helpful and guided me to get the correct color and variant. The main usp of the 2019 suzuki gixxer sf is its aggressive styling which is both refreshingly new and purposeful. It looks sharp and so is the performance, the gixxer sf is powerful and fiel efficient but because of the likes of the apache rtr 1604v and pulsar ns200 at the same price makes it somewhat difficult. The yamaha r15 v3 which also has a 150 cc engine, is very powerful and faster than the gixxer sf. Service and maintenance will not be a problem with the gixxer sf as suzuki is known for its reliability and trust. The riding experience is not so sporty like the r15 v3 or commuter like on the apache rtr 1604v, it has a perfect balance and is one of the comfortable sports bike in the segment. Pros:• comfortable ride• great fit and finish• aggressive styling. Cons:•low performance compared to rivals• windscreen visor not really useful.",Suzuki
Good handling...Great performance. Smooth engine. Really value for money bike.  Great look and full led headlight gives a bright visual appearance at night. Service cost too low under 500 and change the engine at the first servicing as soon as possible. Use motul 10w40 fully synthetic engine oil after the 3rd servicing.,Suzuki
"Good fair looking Led head light superb. Nice mileage, No vibrations at high rpm. Many of them were saying that there is a problem in abs and noise from abs i didn't found any sound from abs so don't go with any negative go for gixxer sf 150. Finally nice bike with low price and sporty look love this. Go for it.",Suzuki
#buying experience i brought this bike june 18 2019. This bike is really awesome and its road presence awesome. If you want to buy a good look and a good standard bike you go with gixxer sf 2019.#riding experience i told you guys this is a segment king in riding quality #performance and looking that is also a segment king again.,Suzuki
"Suzuki gixxer sf is seriously a wow bike.Very good acceleration and more high range looking bike for youngster boys.Very good bike  riding experience. The new disc brake system and abs system is very comfortable to ride the bike.Suzuki gixxer sf is a good bike for daily use. As well as style is great at this price range. The seating position is very good, you won't feel tired on a long ride. Mileage is good in city road you can get 45kmpl and high road it gives 48kmpl. This bike has the best design and the body type for short rides.",Suzuki
This is a good looking bike for young Indian. Also it's sporty bike for a middle class boys. But when we ride it's looks a high class bike. Any one can effort. And it's super fast and smooth. I ride this 121kmph. Personally i want to suggest if you want to a budgeted sport one then u can buy.This bike have a worst point that is looking glass it's to big.,Suzuki
"Gixxer sf 155 is done his job nicely, it’s a good commuter bike with good sport fairing and very attractive eye catchy.I get 50kmpl mileage normally and 55+ kmpl mileage on highway.According to price and 155 cc this is good but sometimes feel low top end performance.Suzuki needs to improve engine for sure !!!",Suzuki
"I am the new of Suzuki Family. Gixxer_SF is Amazing bike in all dimensions. The feeling comes while Driving this bike is Fantastic. The features provide by Suzuki, in this much of cost is enough for Bike_lovers. I love this bike. Best for Ryder's also. Feel proud while Riding this bike. Feel happy for my new bike.",Suzuki
I loved its look and it is very comfortable to ride it even for a long ride i feel no problem in riding it my experience was good as an owner i prefer people to buy this bike and i appreciate the company for such a sporty bike with a fair price only problem is lack of 6th gear and dual abs which enhance the bike and it can get over its competitor like yamaha r15v3 and it is big competitor of the the suzuki gixxer sf.,Suzuki
This machine is very comfortable and affordable on this price segment . Riding this bike is more comfortable after a long drive there is no stress or back pain . Look and build quality is in good side plastic used and all parts are good . Performance is great for this price suzuki services are great .Pros :great machine :good quality :good performance and look. Cons :better provide liquid cooling system : missing of 6th gear.,Suzuki
Its amazing & superb bike in suzuki all bike but gixxer sf is more better than all segment Very good looking bike. Last month's i'm seeing this bike i am very excited to but this bike Black & silver both colour is very good but 250 is more better than 155. I ride this bike in 5 to 6 km its sitting position is very good & very comfortable.,Suzuki
"I haven't buy this bike, but i driven multiple times as one of my friend have it. Just love the bike handling, very smooth handling and the breaking control, As mentioned my riding experience is brilliant.Looks wise bike is superb in both the variant. And servicing is needed at least in a month to see whether everything is perfect.I wish i could afford this bike soon.",Suzuki
Hi I have owned new suzuki gixxer sf. Really comfortable to ride totally much better looking design and attractive pickup engines stylish looks and very nice performance totally my rock street rider.Ultra high speed and engine speed control also looks every thing very nice.I prefer to enjoy good rides with suzuki gixxer sf.,Suzuki
"The gixxer sf is a very good option for riders looking for a fully faired entry level bike at a reasonable price which most of people can afford. The bike looks awesome and suzuki's sep technology is awesome. After riding for 27000 kms over a span of 4 years 8 months .. Here are some pros and cons..Pros.1. Awesome looks (especially the moto gp edition)2. Refined engine - its a suzuki 3. Throttle response is very good 4. High end torque is very consistent 5.  Gear shift indicator and clock on the console is a blessing 6.  Dual channel abs is a blessing 7. Bike reaches 100+ speeds without much effort.Cons: 1. Ground clearance is low so be careful around high rise speed bumps 2. Indicators break often, quality should improve 3. Visor is low (in 2019 model) so win blast could be an issue 4. Seat is on the stiffer side so long rides may be painful.5. Service cost is high as compared to rivals, service network needs to grow 6. Mileage is 30-33 in city conditions.Conclusion: despite some demerits, the gixxer sf is a good bike and at the price point it retails with that refined engine .. Its a very attractive overall package.",Suzuki
Excellent bike for daily commute and stylish in everything mostly youngster should ride the bike for showing extra impression towards others.Service and maintenance is minor in this case. Looks matter everything for this you can take according to your choice.I think if price is little bit high for the youngsters they can't afford it easily.Thank you.,Suzuki
"I am thinking to buys this one because,  i love suzuki. And about the bike nothing to say its gives simply Awesome....Performances...Looks..And from my opinion 3 Disadvantages1) New suzuki gixxer SF as less engine cc compare to old Gixxer engine.  update version should be increase not decrease...2) Visor should be given little bit length & the flow of air while riding the bike is coming form inside the visor..... there is no proper aerodynamic....3)  This point is from my side.,  in MotoGP Edition the colour of blue is not fully completed at the end of engine side cover its given as Black. But in 250cc MotoGP Edition its fully Blue.If this is not a big problem for you. You can buy......But for me i will definitely going to buy this one  MotoGP Edition....",Suzuki
"1. Buying experience is good... I don't think this price is too high... 2. Riding experience is very good according to me.... After 100km/h..It will be not good as before 80km/h3. Looks are impressive.. Eye catching design... Best in performance in this range.. 4. I don't have servicing experience bt i heard about it..... It is low maintenance bike5. Pros.... Good looking, good mileage, good colours available... Cons.... Should have some more power according to 155cc bike.... And it could be more stylish....",Suzuki
The look of this bike is a killer look. Engine of the bike is very refined and riding posture is great. Black colour of this bike looks great. Bhp of this bike is little bit lower but the ok for city riding and long tour. Suzuki offered latest bike in this price segment. The engine provide by suzuki is awesome. You should go for it. It was a awesome bike in 155cc.,Suzuki
"Ultimate bike, riding experience is great. Light weight and the handling is super. Good breaking system, acceleration is awesome. Best bike for this price. Little monster.  Too much comfortable while riding, and it will be also comfort for the back seater. Go for it, you will never regret. I never saw any negative review for this bike....I love it.",Suzuki
"missing for buying new version .. I buyed old version most wonderful riding experience and massive look, First I buyed Pulsar ns 160 not good experience. but this so nice1. Long Ride so Comfortable2. Power all so good3. Gear Shift Is Hard4. Abs Is so nice5. Mileage too good6. looking sportive.",Suzuki
Best bike under 2 lakh for daily usage and also long ride.. very comfortable to ride this bike. Bike height is so good .. everyone can drive for Gixxer bike height ... Millage also very good .. It's give you more than 45km overall milaga which is really good .. nice thing is that is bike looks very good .. it's look like 3 lakhs bikes but we can get this bike under 2 lakh with nice feature..,Suzuki
"Suzuki company given a super quality fully fairing bike. Last year i brought my gixxer.I tried r15 ,rs 200. Finally i like the riding position of gixxer. I loved it most.Value for money. Gixxer sf build quality excellent.Its braking system with single channel abs is fabulous.For long tour it makes me comfortable when i ride.Suzuki gixxer sf's previous version not much impressive for me.When i make 100% to purchase a bike then there were one bike in mind ,that is apache 160 4v. Later my friend informed me about suzuki gixxer new model.I so much excited when i saw its launching video. It's sparkle black colour made my crush from this particular moment.Also brought this color.",Suzuki
"1. There was no issues during the, purchasing of bike. The staff of showroom was too  honest, theirs complications skills are amazing.2. Mostly i used the bike in city In-spite of heavy traffic , the riding comfort are pretty good.Seat is too soft, compared to other sports bike.3. I think in series of sports bikes under 150 k, it is the most reliable.Looks are awesome, specially sparkle black colour. Performance are good. But for rough rider it is not supportive because less torque.Compare to others sport fairing bike, it is very comfortable. Pros.Amazing look, Mileage, Comfortable to ride. Led head light. Fi engine. Break. Cons: Power is little bit low Less torque, Traditional indicator.",Suzuki
The bike looks very good. After first service bikes became very smooth. Handling is superb. But price is high that is ok because it's look like super bike. I achieved my top speed 125km /h that is before first service after service easily push 130. Don't consider this bike as a less powered bike only paper it is 13.4 bhp in reality it is like powerful bike.,Suzuki
Lack of 6th gear and pillion seat have to be little more comfortable.  Must have oil cooled system. Presence of led turn signals is indeed which makes it more premium and dashing. I think it is little expensive also approx 5000 rupees. So these are the pros and cons towards this bike according to me.,Suzuki
"I just love gixxer sf.   the riding position is very comfortable yet sporty. Engine is very smooth.    looks is just awesome, everybody will love this bike, because it made from the same legendary hayabusa dna..The power is little bit less then before but you cant really feel it. service cost is not much high. Around 1200 -1400rs service takes. Maintenance is not much higher like ktm rc and r15. Pros: good looking, comfortable, good mileage, low maintenance, full fairing in cheap price. Cons: There is not much cons of this bike but power should be more.",Suzuki
"I believe you have multiple options , if your list has only Yamaha R15 consider Suzuki GXR 150 indian version. It was hard to get the Motorcycle in Trivandrum But it is worth the wait. Value for money, Better Riding position which is adjustable too, Best mileage in this segment, minimum maintenance cost and Highly attractive design. If you are opting for a bike which less on road and is eye Catchy, Go for GSXR 150 Indian version.",Suzuki
If you want something more than good and better sports experience in good budget and awesome experience of sports go for sf. Low maintenance Insured Would love to ride this because of posture better than any other sports bike i love this one as the variant colors i and my friends own are really awesome this makes our trip a memory.,Suzuki
"Very stylish and sharp looking bike, power Is enough but Suzuki should need To Increase at List 1 BHP more power. Engine is refined and smooth. fiber quality at top notch. Mileage around 50-52 Km/l In City and 55-57 highway. Overall good package but price of the bike is  little bit High.Thank You.",Suzuki
"I bought this bike from my home town yavatmal. Buying experience was good, dealers were cooperative and provided proper info. As they were in contact with me from before they also provided with extra accessories. Riding this bike gives awesome feel. Even if this is a 155cc bike it feels like we are riding some 180cc. Looks of the bike are killer. I own one in white colour and it looks just fab. I got many turn-heads and many people ask me about the model and price. Suzuki service centre mechanics are cooperative and provide good servicing. Talking about pros and cons, pros: 1. Looks are super, 2. Engine is much refined, 3.Good mileage(~45kmpl), 4. I personally love that exhaust sound. Cons: 1. On highways we feel absence of one more gear but fairing does its job to some extent, 2. My mom never sit on this bike because that pillion seat is not enough for ladies to sit cross position.",Suzuki
"Pros:Buying experience was very good,riding experience was also very good and it's looks is stylish and performance is awesome. Servicing and maintenance is also best and pocket friendly.Cons: only problem is it's chain sprocket it's required to change in between 10000kms otherwise it's the best .",Suzuki
"Buying experience is not so good, but the bike is very good. Riding position, handling, mileage and looks all are awesome. Performance wise it's pickup is very fast but above 100 it lacks power. Top speed is 130 km/h best in segment. In one word its comfortable with sporty looks and mileage.",Suzuki
This bike is value for money. The power is less but it is ignorable. Handling in cities and traffic is awesome. Comfort level is extremely good for long rides. Pillion seat is not much comfortable but it's al right. Look of this bike is amazing just like younger brother of Hayabusa. Ground clearance is also good .,Suzuki
"Making the decision to buy this bike wasn't very challenging, as the gixxer sf was the only trustworthy, fared commuter in the 150cc segment. I'd look at it as a beginner's bike. While i'm glad i bought the bs4 compliant which has a tad more power than it's bs6 version, it could still use a bit more horses. However, any lack is compensated by it's looks which are amazing since the facelift, and the riding position. It is so ergonomic that you barely can find a reason to complain about it. It is a full faring with clip-on handle bars and yet you get an almost completely upright riding position, which is suitable for riding without getting tired, and allows you to get off your bike without a stiff-back.The service provided by suzuki could be also rated as more than satisfactory. The folks at the centre do not just help you maintain your bike, but you can also rely on them for any accessories or advice to improve your riding performance. You could tell that these guys know what they're doing.But that's not all to buying a bike. Comparing it with it's competitive, in the price segment, it's tough to find a better bike, impossible to find a fared one. While the r15 is a good fared 150cc, it's costlier and has a notoriously aggressive riding position. In conclusion, if you're planning on buying gixxer sf, i'd definitely recommend you to put some thought and research in it, but i'd assure you that you've got plenty of green flags to purchase this bike and you would barely have any complains.",Suzuki
"This really amazing for daily commute. And also mileage around 45-50 kmpl i get. Sitting position fully comfort also rear seat. And long ride's also superb, mileage, and speed around i checked 130kmph. Looks are fabulous like mini hayabusa. Very comfortable price and very comfortable for family person also, light weight.. i prefer this bike 100%. Superb.  thanks you for suzuki for giving less price, good future's. Especially the abs system working fabulous. Breaking very good. Thank you.",Suzuki
When am buying this bike am not expecting much about this bike. I usually use bike for daily commute but i got surprised by it's performance n handling is quite amazing.I love this bike it also has seat comfort n also suitable for touring also has good fuel capacity tank. Last but not least it has good mileage too.,Suzuki
"My buying experience was simple, it's easy to buy in Mumbai's showroom variety of stuffs discounts and much more offers etc. So I am very happy but one thing is that they gave me small cover and half helmet and it took one month and no response from showroom so I didn't changed instead of changing I bought new one, my riding experience is good but I definitely say that Gixxer SF needs more power I feel it on highway that if they give us more torque and more high-speed than it will well and good but its not under power its perfect for new owners and according to price tag its just perfect engine that I have got and now from look wise I say its just fantastic its something new in market it has its own taste I just loved the look I have glossy black new color and other thing is servicing and maintenance so if we look service centre there are lots of service centers in Mumbai so its easy and I will  share my own service experience that I will say if you have proper knowledge than go to any of service centre or else take a friend suggestion who has knowledge about it or you will be charged extra they will say xyz reasons. Easy to maintain bike looking forward pros and cons so I will add some points gearbox is hard little bit low power and I am not happy with visor but the looks is just awesome smooth engine no vibrations comfortable to ride in traffics, comfortable to ride longer for 3-4 hours, I have ride it non stop almost 4 hours so I will say its very comfortable but I will say riding with pillion in traffics is little bit tough but it depends on riders I will say perfect bike Just Buy it.",Suzuki
"The buying experience was good, this bike is a beast in low and medium end, this bike is a beast, decent on top end as well, reached top speed of 130 km/h on highway, just overall good experience and is comfy for a sports bike with good mileage. I recommend buying this bike, reason, Suzuki's reliable engine and overall experience was top notch.",Suzuki
"i got it for 1.40lakh on road ,awesome riding no problem like back-pain very smooth you must buy this bike. It is not under-powered because it is designed for smooth riding and sexy looks so if you want a fast bike go for r15 but you  can't say this bike is under-powered, go for black color as it looks more appealing than other colors ,good luck cheers...",Suzuki
"Best in class, super smooth. Looks awesome. 45 km in town, 50 km on highway. Best is best. Engine is super refined. Awesome in performance. Best for daily commute & long ride. Gixxer. My gixxer is brilliant & maximum. Nothing to say, perfect in every way with beast look.",Suzuki
"It is the best ever bike in 150-200 cc segment. Ride is smooth and comfortable. Good average,sporty look, and price range is affordable. Look is dashing and attractive. Superb,quality. Riding is best in highway and good performance. Good service and low maintenance. Take time to time oil change for maintain the average and maintenance.",Suzuki
"If you ride gixxer sf once then you won't even think about another bike ,it is very smooth and you feel the power while riding , it is very very amazing to ride gixxer sf Most importantly its average ,it gives 40 kmpl in pune traffic i'm very happy with the bike Its look is very very beautiful just amazing.",Suzuki
I liked the way bike runs smoothly on the highway. I also liked it's suspension and the way it smoothly run in traffic.It is a best combination of commuter and sports bicycle....I loved it very much.So i also prefer you to buy this bike because it is worth for value . Such bike with low price is great thing for us...,Suzuki

Best feature bike ever I have used produces low torque is the best part as you can drive in cities has become easy. Looking gorgeous having own different look than other bikes gives a good impact. Service cost also ok ok. Performance wise this bike is best at this price end and compare to the other best. Over all this bike is fire..,Suzuki
"I just want to say that it is amazing to had ride with this bike. Stunning killer looking with great quality, value and powerful performance.

The 154.9 cc single cylinder air cooled BS4 mill churns out 14.6 Bhp@800 rpm with a torque value of 14nm@ 600 rpm. the engine is mated to a 5 speed manual gearbox. The performance stats are much better than its segment rivals and chasing the higher one is what the motorcycle is made for.,Suzuki

=MILEAGE=:- Yes my bro's I am talking about mileage. here are my honest reviews about famous 150cc bikes now you decide if you really really love your money:),Suzuki
"=PRICING=:- After a long story everyone thinks about ""=Yaar looks to hain par bike bhot costly hai="".T hat dialogue is not gonna work on Gixxer sf. As compared to fantastic KTM 150cc dukes which are burning with price tag of more than rs 1 Lakh 50 thousand and even more, and Yamaha R15 and Honda CBR150 same near about rs 1, 40000 to 1, 60000.",Suzuki
"A great bike I bought from my own money. I learnt riding motorcycles on a Ninja 650R which I didn't own. Then I bought a Thunderbird 500(dad bought me) because I was suggested to buy it as I'm fat(102 kgs, 5'11ft). But had to sell it because of non touring(was doing my MBA). Finally I got a 155 cc bike from Suzuki with my own money this March(still a student at the time of purchase) GSX 150F or Gixxer SF. I went for it because I had 1.10 on hand so couldn't wait or didn't wait to get R15 or RC 200.(not interested in CBR 150 and RS 200) Couldn't test drive it as there were none available for test drives. So I had to make the decision my just sitting on it in the showroom. Paid cash, generated bill and other documents, filled 1 litre petrol(complimentary from Suzuki) and rode home. Bike fell on the 1st hour of my purchase as I was engaging side stand after halting in my garage and there was piece of marble on which I laid the side stand and didn't notice it was slipping. I fell and the bike fell on me.",Suzuki

I fell and the bike fell on me. The left indicator broke off and was hanging. Got up and found no damage on the fairing. Clutch lever got scratches on the rounded end. Fixed indicator with Fevikwik. Great 1st day. After this I knew nothing would happen to the fairings even if it fell. Bike fell like 3 times now. No damage on the fairings, but yes back plastic of the mirror and clutch lever's ends got scratched. I put stickers on the bike and put on LED neons, gear socket protector, throttle control engager, tank pad and a saree stand for my mother to sit on the seat sideways and voila! I have a bike that everyone turns their heads to see while I'm riding. Yes, got a seat cover too because there are cats on my neighbourhood.im very much happy with this bike.",Suzuki
A great bike but the material used are very cheap.so it gets scratches very easily.I think it will look old within 3 months of your purchase.stable at high speed.handling is the best.fuel efficiency is OK type.overall a good bike but Suzuki should give at least the exterior tank should be made of iron like other bikes,Suzuki
A lovely bike from the stable of Suzuki after a very long time. They have come up with such a model that  takes head on their legendary models like shogun and samurai? It is truly a head turner in real sense its a platform which Suzuki should develop more.,Suzuki
"A somewhat more extensive, all the more forcing unit may have worked better.",Suzuki
A special thing of this bike is that so comfertable to ride and looking is very very good.,Suzuki
"A very dearest friend of mine, owns this great bike. And his experience is very very good.",Suzuki
A very good bike for those who want good mileage and also good comfort.,Suzuki

ALL I like this bike especially the price and the specifications are awesome compare to any bike and this type of model is very useful for those who are going for colleges and not only college students but also those who are going to offices they are also carrying the same bike.,Suzuki
"ALSO, THIS BIKE HAS GREAT LOOK AND SEXY LOOK WHICH MAKE THIS BIKE LOOK MORE EXPENSIVE THEN ITS ORIGINAL PRICE.",Suzuki

"ANY ONE CAN DRIVE WITH FULL CONTROL ITS HANDLING IS NOT TOO TOUGH. THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST BIKE IN THIS RANGE OF PRICE, IF ANY BODY IS PALNNING TO BUY BIKE I MUST SAY GO AND TEST THIS BIKE YOU WILL LOVE IT.",Suzuki
About gixxer sf fi the gear is kinda stif. The seats are hard. My back starts paining and I remember while I was visiting their showroom they were offering more than 55kmpl,Suzuki
About mileage yes we can say the biggest loophole is mileage as it comes under 150cc segment but you can expect a maximum mileage of 32kmpl which is very less as compare to pulsar 150 and others.,Suzuki
According to company the milage is 64 kilometres/ liter . But in real it give milage up to 58 km/liter. Condition is that you have to maintain your bike .,Suzuki
According to its looks I will give 5 on 5 as it has great look a lill similar to Hayabusa by Suzuki. I was also confused for the first time and I have noticed many times people looking at it like Hayabusa only.,Suzuki
"According to me it is the best in its segment, cool looks, for enthusiastic mileage freak riders . Best in class 150 cc motorcycle The air-cooled, single-cylinder 155cc engine is the same as the Gixxer too. The engine makes 14.6bhp and 14Nm of torque. . The riding position of the SF is similar to the Gixxer's with the flat handlebar and the slightly rear-set foot pegs that give the motorcycle its sporty feel. I personally own gixxer sf, on an average I could get upto 50 km of mileage .The Length of Gixxer SF is 2050mm, width is 785 mm, height is 1085mm, seat height is 780mm, ground clearance is 160mm and wheelbase is 1330mm. The kerb weight of the bike is 139 kg(this means that the weight of SF version just 4kg more in comparison to the weight of Gixxer) and the fuel tank capacity is 12 litres.",Suzuki
According to me it is the best most affordable sports bike in India.,Suzuki
"According to my personnel experience of this bike, I would to say that this bike is very stylish. there is no one in race of style with this bike. I like this bike just because of its style and power. its fuel consumption is more . it gives less mileage. but it is very comfortable bike. the reliability of this bike is above average but its road grip is just awesome. its handling is really awesome. the only fault in it is its less mileage.",Suzuki
"Actually I own this bike. It's a pretty good sports bike in small budget. It's looks super cool. I think 150cc enough for any sports bike like this. This gives mileage of about 45-50 km/ltr. It's doesn't have very unusual seats, they are pretty comfortable.It's tyres have very good grip & it becomes more reliable because it has disc brakes on both tyres front & back. It comes in various colours like blue, black, red & it has a special edition colour too. I think its a very appealing bike in general.",Suzuki
Actually it is my first bike so my parents were worried whether I will be able to handle it but it is not heavy like other bikes and trust me the handling is amazing!,Suzuki
"Actually we teenagers are enjoying riding on bike and to talk with air., and this is reason I have Gixxer.we all want to express our attitude with bikes and this is perfect bike.now every good thing have some special features and in gixxer I liked the design, average, controlling, power, headlights and the best part is digital meter because just before I buy it I have scared about the gears(in which gear I am riding)and this fear is gone away because in digital meter we can see in which gear we are.second thing is that when riding on bike we don't have any idea about the time and fuel because if fuel is empty we waste lots of time this is also solved because we have this information on the digital meter., and the disk break give you protection when you have stop instantly., now dislikes if you want to go with family this bike is not so useful because of its seat design and rest of the things are best.if you want to ride alone or with friends gixxer is recommended.",Suzuki
"Adar Para(Angshik) , Jalpaiguri, Kotwali, Jalpaiguri - 735101 India",Suzuki
After 15000 km ride. Bike still have smooth driving good pickup and comfortable in long distancs. Thers a little issue with mileage its starts around 38-40kmpl but now its come around 32-35kmpl. And little gear trouble. Bt still awsm road grip above 100km/hr. Its looks awsm,Suzuki
"After a long period of mild sale on indian market, suzuki has mad its royal re-entry on indian market through their gixxer products. these bikes are strictly focused on youth who wants to show them up without tearing their pocket.",Suzuki
"After a long time, I am planning to change my pulsar and all my eyes are on Gixxer SF. it has got a good sporty looks, last week when I was crossing road I had seen this in a flash, for one second I thought it a imported sports model. I was aware of gixxer but I didn't now that SF model was also available.",Suzuki
"After one week of survey I got confused between buying a Suzuki Gixxer Sf, Yamaha FsZ V2 & Yamaha Fazer V2",Suzuki
"After riding it and experiencing it, Everything that Suzuki claimed was 100% authentic. The aerodynamics on the Suzuki Gixxer SF is so good that it can gain real good momentum in very less time. And it offers so much confidence that its rider just can't get over the performance this bike offers. The Suzuki Gixxer SF was launched to take on the Yamaha Fazer and Yamaha R15.",Suzuki
"After the launch of gixxer it was big hit and changed the suzuki appearance on Indian market, then they Introduced Gixxer Sf the same bike with faring which leads to mixed reaction on Indian consumers the enthusiasts of biking community where disappointed due to no increase in power and facility but many of young rider who wanted a bike which looks cool and good enough fuel economy had big smile on their face. And this resulted again a big hit; here is my review on suzuki gixxer sf review",Suzuki
"Air vents that sit on either side of the headlight are there for aesthetics rather than performance gains. Moving back, the rest of the design is just like the Gixxer’s, so you get the same muscular fuel tank, single-piece seat, a stubby rear with split grab handles and integrated LED tail-light.",Suzuki
"Air vents that sit on either side of the headlight are there for aesthetics rather than performance gains.

"All features of the new Gixxer SF is designed to give a sporty and premium look. It has an Aluminum exhaust end cover, new clear lens indicators and pinstripe on the wheels gives it a sharp and edgy look. Guaranteed all motorcycle, loves will love it.",Suzuki
All u know that Japanese technology is ahead of others. Now he had lunched the bike which was made in the same tunnel where the mightiest bike hayabhusha is made.,Suzuki
Also  a greater and effective bike in 150 to 200cc.The riding in  the city is very good and suspension which is metro suspension also good.,Suzuki
Also it os lose in the top speed.ita top speed is 116 .but the other bike are get better speed then it.,Suzuki
Also less space more second person if you carrying a bag with you,Suzuki
"Although its average is very decent you will get an average of 50-55 any time and which is more than enough by looking at it, means you will not get this average in any other bike with same muscles. rating 4/5",Suzuki
"Amazing pickup and smoothness in the bike which is best in the segment, great handling in the corners which makes it a suitable bike for the city riders, mileage is great both city and highway.Suzuki service pathetic parts availability all are pathetic, gear sometimes feels hard, handle position is not good.Style and performance with great mileage in its segment.A must buy bike for the new riders as well as someone who needs power as well as style as well as mileage.It is the best bike in its league.",Suzuki
An impressive design below 1 lakh is a positive point for the newcomer as the price fully justifies its beauty.,Suzuki
And a long race of very good mileage of 47kmpl.In this bike very good pickup and very good racing superbike.,Suzuki
"And all shading are lovely.but the best shading is blue.The Suzuki Gixxer SF accompanies a 154.9cc single chamber, four stroke, air cooled motor equipped for furnishing riders with 14.6 Bhp at 8000 rpm with 14 Nm of crest torque.its simple and prepared to ride .and I say last just Best look in its budget  .all that much& its made for all lovers of suziki.very much",Suzuki
And also this bike has very good quality suspension. I had around 7 accidents on it but I doesn't need to spend even a single penny on it.,Suzuki
"And everything  exept this is great in bike.superb handling, balancing is good, front disc is fine but the rear break is not so good. Top speed of bike 130 as dealer said to me but I did't reached that. I dont think that is actual speed of the bike.",Suzuki
And it is one of the fastest bike in the mid range series bikes.,Suzuki
And mileage provided as of R15 it got style with mileage which made it so good.many bikes are having style but not mileage and if having mileage not the style but Suzuki made gixxer a good enhancement in both perspective providing style as sports bike attracted it more for bike lovers am very excited to ride as it made me feel like driving sports bike.,Suzuki
And my friends who got chence to drive this bike they suggest this Suzuki gixxer sf.,Suzuki
And no more looks only bluse bike no more colour in this type of bike.,Suzuki
And now let's go into topic! Gixxer SF love the way Suzuki has designed the product!,Suzuki
"And one more thing I have noticed, even if there is a small cuting on the road or the road is split. it will be very hard to handle the bike",Suzuki
And the 2nd person seat is very short so if 2 persons are riding then the back person will be a bit uncomfortable else the bike is good,Suzuki
And the back weel keeps skidding. idk its cos of the road but still.,Suzuki
"And the most important thing about color is even though by default there is no stickers present on the bike, you can get it from showroom itself. So when you purchase ask for the Gixxer Moto GP sticker. and mind my words this black beast looks superb when you apply sticker over it. It is for sure that wherever you go, people will always look twice towards your beast cause of the stunning looks.",Suzuki
And the suzuki manufactured bike gixxer sf is a sport racing bike and it has 155cc engine which is very powerful and has a best pick up in all the 155cc bikes compare to other company bikes.,Suzuki
"And then, to my horror I notice oil stains on the garage floor under the bike. Obviously, the service engineer hadn’t tightened the oil drain plug properly, making the engine oil drip. It was a bad idea to take Suzuki Gixxer for another long trip to the Suzuki service station so I got the bolt tightened and engine oil topped up at a local workshop",Suzuki
And this has got great pick up and mileage! Suzuki has designed it for youngsters! And got huge success! It's budget friendly! I love this one! But I suggest this only for youngsters!,Suzuki
"And to be frank, once you get this bike you can't resist yourself from riding everyday, and flaunting.",Suzuki
"Another major drawback of the Gixxer SF is its uncomfortable riding position. The bike has a forward-leaning riding posture that can cause discomfort, especially during long rides. The seat is also quite hard, which can add to the discomfort.",Suzuki
Anyone would love to ride the SF. The ride height and seating position is comfortable and would suit a rider of any stature. The placement of the handle-bars is neither too low nor too high allowing the rider to sit straight and enjoy the ride at cruising speeds or even duck down and go flat out. The visor on the fairing helps to deviate the air over the rider and maintaining speeds in excess of 100kmph is not a tiresome task.,Suzuki
"Apart from the front fairing, the rest of the design has been retained from the naked Suzuki Gixxer, so you get the same tank, seats, side panels, split grab-rails and tail piece. Even the instrument console is carried over from the Gixxer - with speedo, tacho, gear indicator and clock on the digital display, along with a handy gear shift indicator light. Thanks to this part sharing, the Suzuki Gixxer is currently the most affordable full-faring motorcycle available in India!",Suzuki
Apart from this no other issue is there and my friend over all satisfied with the performance of this bike.,Suzuki
Appeal - It has a sporty look which will appeal anyone very easily.,Suzuki
Appeal:- It has a sporty look which will easily appeal anyone very easily. And it is available in very good shades and graphics.,Suzuki
Appeal:It has a sporty look which will easily appeal anyone very easily.,Suzuki
"Areas of improvement The bike should get a more aggressive seating position, rear disc brake, split seats, brighter headlamp and a 200-cc version(being greedy here) would make it a class apart.",Suzuki
As Suzuki has provided one of it's Best bike in India.Here the one Gixxer SF variant as compare as per the market need.This new Gixxer line up is just under 1 lak. As compare to Hornet 160 this bike have best handling.The tier are more wide due which give more gripe to handle in tight crone. This 160 cc give nice amount of torque at high as well as low. The fuel efficiency is also good for day to day.The seating comfort is also good for both setter .Ultimate this bike is perfect balance in this price bracket,Suzuki
"As expect told, Headlight doesn't suits with bike body style.",Suzuki
"As far as specifications are concerned, the engine on the Gixxer SF is the same as that of the Suzuki Gixxer – a 155cc single-cylinder, air-cooled motor which produces 14.8PS of power at 8, 000rpm and 14Nm of torque at 6, 000rpm. This engine has been tuned for broad low-end to rque and punchy mid-range. That makes the Gixxer SF very very capable and with decent power in traffic and in normal speeds around town. In terms of mileage, the Gixxer SF too offers very good fuel efficiency, with mileage in the range of 45-48kmpl uner normal riding conditions. Handling is brilliant and ride quality is quite sorted.",Suzuki
"As most motorcycle companies launching their beast on road,Suzuki also launched their youngest member of their GSX family. Its a outstanding bike with robust and sturdy make and ultra light engine which make u mad as it can reach 9.5K RPM .",Suzuki
"As per my personal review being a suzuki gixxer sf rider, the bike is very much comfortable in long drives. it gives me an average mileage of 45kmpl. it is very stylish and sporty in looks. it looks attractive and its copied design from suzuki hayabusa makes it more attractive. its handling is very good as compared to other bikes. braking and clutching is very awesome also. it is one of the most reliable bikes I have ever come across. it is very light weighted and very smooth riding bike. I have already driven it more than 18000 kms in my hometown. till now it has some minor problems and it is one of the best bikes I have ever come across.",Suzuki
As we all know suzuki gixxer sf is a faired version of naked gixxer where sf stand for Sports-fairing.,Suzuki
As we all know suzuki is a very big brand and it takes very impressive steps to make its cars and bikes but the sad thing is that this suzuki gixxer sf does not have good handling and controlling and that is the most essential thing that should be perfect in a bike but it is not in the case of suzuki gixxer sf and this bikes fuel consuption is also not good as it shows mileage of 38 kilometers in city as well as highways.comfort reliability are ok types but looks is goo,Suzuki
As we know that gixxer sf bike is from Suzuki a well brand which produce great bike.I have recently taken this bike and my experience about this bike is very positive this bike has a awesome pickup and well developed look .This bike has a nice average with awesome controlling and it gives me a high performance in street with awesome average and look.From this it has a nice feature with fabb comfort and suspension.,Suzuki
"As with the majority of the body panels, the engine, the gearbox and the cycle parts are exactly the same as the naked Gixxer. So, the Gixxer SF gets a refined, nice sounding and peppy 14.8PS, 155cc single cylinder engine that is mated to a 5-speed gearbox. It’s a nice combo but the gearbox could do with slightly crisper shifts.",Suzuki
"As you can tell by the image above, the SF is based on the Gixxer. The front of the motorcycle is where the differences lie.",Suzuki
"As you can tell by the image above, the SF is based on the Gixxer. The front of the motorcycle is where the differences lie. . The air-cooled, single-cylinder 155cc engine is the same as the Gixxer too. The engine makes 14.6bhp and 14Nm of torque.",Suzuki
"As you can tell by the image above, the SF is based on the Gixxer. The front of the motorcycle is where the differences lie. The swept-back headlamp design is exactly the same as the Gixxer’s, while the full fairing apes the ones on Suzuki’s larger capacity GSX-R motorcycles. Air vents that sit on either side of the headlight are there for aesthetics rather than performance gains. Moving back, the rest of the design is just like the Gixxer’s, so you get the same muscular fuel tank, single-piece seat, a stubby rear with split grab handles and integrated LED tail-light.",Suzuki
"As you move towards the sides, you notice the chiseled tank doesn't have any other changes, when compared to the naked version and from here onward both the motorcycles look the same.",Suzuki
"At any time you cant neglect its style, muscles and looks. it will give you the feeling of perfect sports bike.",Suzuki
At speed of 100kmh it don't get out of control.powerful brakes.,Suzuki
"Avoiding all shortcomings, why wouldn't any one consider the high price you are charging out of their wallet. If only one has made up his mind to wash hands off this much of money, why wouldn't he consider Honda CBR 150R or Yamaha R15 2.0? Wish your fat blue baby could attract people only with it's looks:D",Suzuki
Awesoe bike suzuki under 1 lack the milage of the bike is very good as 45 to 48 km/liter bike is so fle efficiet,Suzuki
"Awesome Bike to ride in the City, Highways.very stable on the road and rides smoothly in all the weather conditions. It is a gem in its class. It is a nice bike which gives you a pride while ride. Mileage is 40-50 in city. Good pick up and smooth riding even in high RPM. Thanks SUZUKI !",Suzuki

"Because, This suzuki gixxer sf gave us a smooth driving experience.",Suzuki
Before buying I have confusion between yamaha fz and gixxer sf after all comparison I buyed gixxer it means suzuki gixxer sf is better than yamaha fz.,Suzuki
"Being a variant of the Gixxer, the new Suzuki Gixxer SF continues to be powered by the 155cc single cylinder, SOHC, air-cooled and carburetted engine that also powers its naked sibling. The motor is light and fairly spirited producing 14.8PS of peak power at 8, 000rpm and 14Nm of maximum torque at 6, 000rpm.",Suzuki
"Being connected to the bike generates more confidence when you start to push. Just another reason why I continue to love the bike ride. It is also very reasonably efficient. Given the generous use my throttle, I got a decent 45-47kmpl in faster commutes, at the position of trafficking often goes above 50kmpl.",Suzuki
Being in 150 cc bike is more reliable and one can easily afford at ex showroom price.,Suzuki
Being in a sports look the bike is short handled and provides an amazing experience while riding. It gives u a great comfort while riding even in roughy road areas. Looks and design is amazing as it is designed according to a perfect sports bike module.,Suzuki
Being the most cheapest fully faired bike in its segment it excels in various other aspects.,Suzuki
Besides the engine specs in real world condition there is a plenty of torque available under 2000 rpm which makes city touring a breeze.It has that typical free reving engine that inspires from the beast gsxr1000. The only complain that it has only 5 gears.Otherwise it will be the new trend setter in its class.,Suzuki
Best bike I have ever seen in my life really its a good experience by having it it really you will love this its like a dream bike its very comfortable to be driven and space inside is very good and the things that a person wants for his journey this bike has got all of these qualities I my self have experience but also have got to know from many of the persons about this bike fuel is less gainer it looks very very stunning and dashing in looks,Suzuki
Best bike in its class. If it would have come with clip-on it would be best. Speaking about avg it gives 40+ . The visuals have been inspired from Suzuki gsxr 1000. Tires should have been better. If it's fitted with clipon by local garage. It would be ready for the track bike. Great for youth who are going for 150cc segments full faired.,Suzuki
Best build quality and a nice sports bike in a below 1lakh segment,Suzuki
"Best in class 150cc bike. I hv this bike since 5 months. its looks mind blowing. I got almost 50km/lit milage. it hv super led tell lamp, and engine kill swich. I love this bike so much. I specially like blue color. but recently lunched so many colours. fjoijgoifjwoigjowjgjowefroiQEFRHJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJASAAAAA",Suzuki
Best part of this bike is. Its mileage. Approxx 45-55 kmpl in real condition.the price tag also a very good reason to buy gixxer sf.recently suzuki lauches a special edition of this bike. If you want a 150cc bike with good looks. And Handling. Then go for it guys. Its a fun machine. Giving 8.5/10,Suzuki
Best powerful Male Look Bike can't be ignored with superb design.,Suzuki
Bike colour is very nice and it looks very nice.fuel consuption of suzuki gixxer sf is 35 to 40 km/ltr.suspension of bike is very good and comfort.disc breke is really nice working.and engine modify is very well,Suzuki
Bike feels stable at higher speed and can cruise at 80-90 all day,Suzuki
Bike is best designed for the city use purpose for high traffic.,Suzuki
Bike is best designed for the city use purpose for high traffic. To control the bike,Suzuki
Bike is best designed for the city use purpose for high traffic. To control the bike you get a disc break. and also the PICK Up of the bike is fantastic. It is better than the bikes that you get in higher price of other brands.,Suzuki
Bike is good and the engine is refine and stability is also good but the build quality and fit finish of this bike is not that good but gives linear power I use this bike for more than 2 years and this bike is reliable and easy to use motercycle but price is high compare to other bikes,Suzuki
Bike is good and too attractive if u want to lure beautiful senoritas.,Suzuki
Bike was good built in . You love it when u ride it and when you sit on it . Its a one of the fastest bike in 15o cc rang and within 1 lakh rang.its bike best then the r15 and cbr150 .gixxer sf is looks like 3 to 5 lakh bike in price only 1 lakh. Best bike for youngster.,Suzuki
Bikes heart means engine is well designed with 154cc and mileage of 45km/litre. I manage to fill tank with 45 km speed. Over heats on riding continuously.,Suzuki
"Blue, Black and Red that make the look of bike great and better.",Suzuki
"Both the tyres of this bike are 17 inch and both tyres alloy wheels, and both tyres tubeless, which gives",Suzuki
"Bought new gixer last month and went for service on  18.12.2015 at paramaan suzuki, vanuvampet. And reveived the bike condition as rear wheel punture. The air pressure goes down within 15 mins. And front indicator was not fixed as per my compliant.",Suzuki
Bought this bike 1 and half years ago and its been an excellent experience riding this beauty.,Suzuki
"Brought this for 1, 10, 000₹ on the road. I feel some bad experience from this bike. The body kit of Gixer sf is of no use. If once the bike falls to a side during running or parking the complete body kit will get damaged. My bike accidentally fall to the opposite side of the stand while I am washing the bike my bikes body kit got as many scratches. Poor headlights are another problem it's headlights are not bright for the night journey even it is dim or bright. Back seat is not comfort to sit. The person who sit in the back seat will experience a difficulty while riding but rider seat is good.Other than that problems bike is quite good performance and breaking is good.",Suzuki
"Bullet& Honda karizma. This one looks totally different so yes boys, now this blue colour will attract even more eyes than other ones, very unique machine.",Suzuki
"But I driven that bike once, that time I feel it is wonderful bike. It is 150 cc bike around 88, 000. The max mileage is 54 kmpl and the fuel tank capacity is 12 litrs. It is better than Yamaha bike also. It very comfort bike compare the other 150 cc bikes. Road Grip is awesome.",Suzuki
"But I faced wired problem that after I runned my bike for 500 km I thought to take it for high speed as suggested by one of my friend to get good performance and when I did it my got off when I slowed down the speed after reaching high speed of 120kmph, it didnt start till five minutes, it got started afterwards . I felt scared and rided slowly till 800kms after that again as suggested in owner manual I tried to ride below 7000 rpm but when again I took it for around 6000rpm bike showed me same problem.",Suzuki
But I like metallic Triton blue with pearl mirage white colour which is not available in showroom now when I got then I will post again review,Suzuki
But I think the disadvatge is that this is very expensive product I must say that.,Suzuki
But after taking eyes on all these things we can say that it is a Great bike to purchase if you are not having very high budget,Suzuki
But just one small problems is the hight of the silencer pipe is little bit low for which sometimes when I crossed the big speed brekers the silencer pipe touching the road.,Suzuki
But no doubt that the bike is great aesthetically and in all other technical aspects except these important things.,Suzuki
"But not very comfortable in rough roads.while riding the bike people look at u  whn u stand it people stare at it, asks questions about it.u can feel happy for ur choice.if u a bike with good looks with moderate power with fair price go for it.bt if u r worried abt the fuel consumption then buy pulsar 150as. But suzuki is a good brand, u can trust on.",Suzuki
"But now, a time has come when the brand ambassador of Suzuki has had to'cover' himself up, and while Suzuki has followed suit, they seem to have done a much better job. Enter the Gixxer SF, faired version of the very successful 150cc motorcycle.",Suzuki
But power is not good and comfert is bad it only like this bike body only bad in power I dont like this this bike is only ok not good control is good and good look also this is not to good some feature are not there suzuki gixxer sf is my dream bike when I saw its advertisement in elision with salman khan I love it s deficiency is also very good suzuki gixxer is avealible in many different colores in the markerr its mileage and liiks are awesome it is very comfoert in any kined of rod,Suzuki
But riding is so smoothly and easy.Awesome head light and exhaust sound is not noisy that's good part of this bike.In comparison of best affordable this bike has best bike.This bike can be easily handle in traffic city and smoothly riding.So its good to buy without any doubt.,Suzuki
"But the SF is more comfortable at high speeds due to the aerodynamic design. Also the SF caters to a different set of audience, one looking for an affordable faired motorcycle. And the Gixxer SF wins here with ease.",Suzuki
But the comfort of this bike is incredible .if u had ride this bike will clearly see the difference in the handling with other bikes in its segment.this bike had a immersive power and blow up the winds easily,Suzuki
"But then again, this is not what I was expecting from a faired motorcycle. It would have been nice if Suzuki would have re-tuned this motor to churn out some more power. True that the additional weight does not make it feel sluggish on the street, but it would have performed better in line with the sporty look. The fuel economy of 40-43kmpl could have been a lot better, even if at present it is better than its competition. Even so, consumers will be happy about the refinement of the engine and the minimum number of vibrations even at high speeds, something that Suzuki has beautifully worked upon.",Suzuki
But with mask 100000. It also has 1 Moto gp addition which costs 2000.Its millage is also good @45 kmpl approximately.,Suzuki
"But with the SF weighing just four kilos more than its street sport twin, performance too is similar to its naked sibling.",Suzuki
By changing engine oil frequently you can keep your bike performance good for long time,Suzuki
CONS; COMBO BRAKE SYSTEM IS NOT SON EFFICIENT WHICH IS EXPECTED,Suzuki
Certainly on the basis of road conditions the bike provides a mileage of about(40 to 50 kilometer per hour).,Suzuki
Comfort - The seat and root rash is fully comfortable to long drive and tours.,Suzuki
Comfort very good in the SUZUKI GIXXER SF and at a time the brakes rear and front are both are disc .,Suzuki
"Comfort — Gixxer SF does not vibrate even at top speeds. I rode it at 125 kmph and did not feel any vibration! That speaks of the volume of comfort the bike offers. You can ride it at a stretch. However, the pillion seat is really uncomfortable and could give you a sore butt.",Suzuki
"Comfort- as far as comfort-ability is concerned, it's fine on the highways or where there is less traffic, in the cities its not that good as one has to keep applying brakes and clutch.",Suzuki
Comfort- it is also very comfort for two person. but I can drive with three persons.,Suzuki
Comfort: basically best for driver but bavk seat is slighted TILTED so when press break person will fall on driver ( which is good for exceptional conditions) .,Suzuki
Comfort:- The seat and soot rash is very comfortably designed. And you be able to travel a long distance on the bike without any back pain issues. But it will be a bit uncomfortable for the tall people(5'9'+). But not comfortable for the long tours.,Suzuki
Comfort:- Yup so about comfort driver seat is very comfortable and you can drive 300-400 comfortably .,Suzuki
"Comfortable for 1 person youngsters, because back seat is too high for Indian ladies(because of Saree)",Suzuki
"Comfortable lean and fat also comforting this bike, I like very much. My friend using this bike, so I m drive this bike, good condition good style more colours and comfortable so I m very much like suzuki.",Suzuki
Coming to comfort riders seat is very interesting and comfortible and back seat is good for friends and girl friends not for parents. Front brake abs gives comfort to sudden brakes. On rainy and hilly roads gives low comfort.,Suzuki
"Coming to the features of the motorcycle, there is not much that I would want to specifically point out as it shares most of the components with its naked sibling. The digital instrument-cluster is straight away carried from the Gixxer and does the job perfectly. The font is clearly visible during the day, in harsh sunlight and at night as well. With the orange back-lit illumination, this instrument panel boasts of the tachometer, clock, gear indicator, odometer, fuel gauge, indicators and an RPM indicator, which are all arranged neatly in the rectangular housing. The RPM indicator is adjustable and can be set in between 5, 000rpm to 9, 500rpm to indicate the gear shifts - a feature that the competition lacks.",Suzuki
"Commemorating Suzuki's 2015 return to MotoGP racing, The brand new GIXXER SF sports the Suzuki Racing Blue livery to specific Suzuki's spirit and fervour for racing! Go forward, Distinct your appreciate for MotoGP. Speed up in advance and luxuriate inside the feeling on every single street. Receive the thrills and adrenaline hurry. The streets are waiting about. Make your existence felt.",Suzuki
Compared to R15 it is very useful and comfortable for the pillion rider.,Suzuki
"Cons- Ergonomically not sporty as compared to R15.Rear disk brake was not provided when it was lunched, which doest gives a good braking. I didnt like the long mirror stand infront.That strait bar handle which I didnt like they should provide a clip on bar handle. Which make you feel a sport bike feeling.",Suzuki
"Cons: - Though the Gixxer SF is awesome bike there are few bad things as well. The back seat is not comfort just like R15 V.02, legs pain after 1/2 hr and starts itching very soon, after one year my bike started slight rate of vibration when I shift gear, pickup got reduced, though the top speed is 128 it takes slow pickup after 117, mileage reduces once u cross 110 ( 30kmpl) which is bad for 156 cc bike, bike makes some annoying sound",Suzuki
Consistently getting around 37-38 kmpl in city riding conditions and 45 kmpl on highways.,Suzuki
"Control:- it is having good control, also it has gone through air tunnel test, control is fantastic .",Suzuki
"Controlling, Comfort, Style and Mileage wise it is the Best Deal.",Suzuki
Cool looking bike that every boy wants to ride it once.only once because when we drives we come to know that the parts are in such a way that it was attached to the bike with gum.It looks aukward when we are riding but looks great when it is seen by others .,Suzuki

"Definately a good bike on indian streets.Gixxer SF is the Amalgamation of good looks , power and comfort. Blue colour shines out with the flourescent yellow strip on the wheel rims making it more attractive. The double exhauxt give it a sports bike appearance. Digital display is equally good expressing the gears the bike goes through( very good for amatures) .150cc bike has a powerful pickup.Decent average with a good fuel capacity.

Impressive headlights as well as tail-lights.comfortable one can drive more then 100kms at a strech.Overall a good bike for indian roads.",Suzuki
"Design is taken from higher version in sports bike nothing new. Speedometer is the worst part in terms of looks, very dull and as if a cheap mobile is been placed instead of actual speedometer. I am talking about some new innovation apart of the fairing and modified GP look.",Suzuki
"Digital ignition system which shows every detail about bike. Like- speed, audometer, gears, laps etc.",Suzuki
"Digital instrumentation is also good. It shows 2 trip meters, grear shift indicator, clock, tachometer and last but not the least speedometer with a awesome red led back light.",Suzuki
Does this bike's chessy or its wings make noise after riding about 2-4 years ?,Suzuki

Engine 4 stroke 2 valves single cylinder air cooled engine proves that you are paying for good,Suzuki
"Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Awesome engine sound, 38 - 41 kmpl mileage. Gearbox is smooth, sometimes it gives trouble shifting to 1st gear from neutral. Engine becomes hot easily.",Suzuki
"Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox The engine is incredibly powerful. In fact, I might be exaggareting if I say Gixxer SF actually throws you backward when revved hard. Undoubtedly, it can't meet the power delivery of Yamaha R15 or Honda CBR but it can't be counted out as well. Just rev the throttle and you get power on demand, adequate enough to make vehicles disappear on the rear-view mirror. On highways, the bike just flies, sans any vibration. The engine does not sound stressed even after crossing the 100 kmph mark.",Suzuki
"Engine Type 4-Stroke, 2-Valve, Single Cylinder, Air -Cooled Engine",Suzuki
Engine is compleaty smooth and the way it dilivers the power is the most ossum part of the gixer it just swifts you as you want the ENGINE RESPONCE is the biggest part of like.,Suzuki

Feul consumption - my bike is 1year old ( nov 15) gives me average of 55 at highways and 45 in city. What more u can expect from a 155cc bike,Suzuki
Final Verdict: Buy this vehicle if you want to flaunt yourself with a Veryy rich looking bike. and not really considering its mileage.,Suzuki
Final Words Its the best in its price range. Suzuki has compromised with its engine but It is.Areas of improvement Disc brake in rear should be introduced and engine capacity should be increased.,Suzuki
"Final Words Suzuki Gixxer SF is a no-nonsense commuter bike that can double up as tourer. Gifted with super sporty looks, the bike is an excellent companion for city as well as highway riding. The seating position, (during solo riding) can be customized according to the rider's comfort. The mileage is good considering the fact that it has a poweful engine.",Suzuki

Every feature of the Gixxer SF is designed to give a sporty and premium look - from its futuristic-looking aluminum exhaust end cover, new clear lens indicators and pinstripe on the wheels gives it a sharp & edgy look, guaranteed to appeal to all motorcycle lovers!",Suzuki
"For May 2017, the suzuki Gixxer and Gixxer SF(full faired variant) get new energetic design over the fuel tank alongside a significantly bigger Gixxer decal on the tank. The bicycles additionally accompanied clear loan Drove Tail lights that add to the visual interest of the bicycles. The Gixxwr will be accessible in three hues- pearl Mira Red, Metallic Triton Blue and Glass Shimmer Dark.

The 2017 suzuki Gixxer SF is presently accessible in new lively illustrations enluvended from the suzuki logo over all hues- Matallic Triton Blue, Glass shimmer dark and metallic Tangle dark, and pearl Mira",Suzuki
"For almost 1, 00, 000 this is crappiest thing anyone can buy not even liquid cool engine and its breaks suck with only 5 speed it lacks in speed as well a torque only looks and tires fine okay bike for cornering it also have good design but its too much for daily riding okay for short high way rides but city will create a hurdle",Suzuki
"For further information on the MOVE operation, see Move Operations. It is summarized in Figure ""MOVE Operation"".",Suzuki
For me Suzuki Gixxer Sf wins the competition quite convincingly.,Suzuki
"For the 150CC bikes, Mileage would be more than 45KM at-least but its giving very low around 36KM and sometimes 30KM as well( High speed riding in city roads) .",Suzuki
Friends first of all I want to tell you that gixer is always stated as it is not a good bike but I really think why people always say that. Friends go get a fz hornet and hornet test drive you will realy feel that hornet is only powerfull on papers. I own a gixer from 1year let me tell you all about it,Suzuki
Friends this bike is really good and it has very good mileage and this is very useful for long road journeys. The comfort of this bike is somehow ok and we can enjoy the ride. This bike is available at two colours blue and red. The red colour is new one in market. This bike has very pathetic pick up and it is a fastest bike. This bike has very good look and body. The engine power of this bike is also very good. The tyres of this bike is broad and the chocopsers are really good and we can experience a good ride on this bike even in bad roads. The value of this bike is low as compared to other sport bikes. The road grip of this bike is also good. The disk brakes of this bike is also very good.,Suzuki
"From long time I was waiting for the bike like this and I was little bit surprised to see this bike came from SUZUKI .No doubt the bike is awesome. Its a good replacement for new karizma or KTM duke RC 390  or pulsar 220 .My bikes colour is the signature colour for this bike i.e. blue and it looks awesome.With 150 cc engine 14.8 ps of power it performs great .Handling is also up to the mark .With 1330 mm of wheel base stability of bike is good. For long rides and for city riding this bike is perfect . If anyone with requirement of bike with such bike with great styling, awesome performance and decent price should go for it .",Suzuki
From the first look it's the most stylish two wheeler bike under 1 lakh in india.it got robost 160 cc liquid cool engine with 5 speed manual transmission.It has 14Nm  max torque and 14 ps of power.,Suzuki
Front and rear brake timing is very efficient and the very good also the ground clearance and wheel base of tyre is sufficient to maintain the balance of the bikes at higher speed.,Suzuki
"Front face is similar to the GSX-R 600/1000 or the Hayabusa in terms of headlight design and front air scoops. Bike is dressed in Suzuki’s clichéd moto GP colour scheme. A visor up front round and tall just enough to deflect wind. Seating is aggressive as the clip-on are lower and at a sharper angle, something that we didn’t see on the outgoing Gixxer 155-SF. Foot pegs are raised as well as the exhaust end can is articulated upwards for better cornering geometry. Upside down fork, Brembo brake units equipped with ABS considering rider safety assisted with sticky tires is increasing the weight age of the motorcycle in segment.",Suzuki
"Front light and connected body is fixed and only handle is moving, this is an unique feature which sometimes gives you discomfort in looking for back view mirror.",Suzuki
Front mirror are get loose very easily. You always for fix them to the service center and requested for the same which they listen very hardly.,Suzuki
"Front wheel becomes tight due to friction in disc brake.i have checked for oil and other basic things but sitll the problem is there.in service centre they said disc plate has bent and they said they will replace it within 25 days.i have waited for more than 3 months.in that three months I crossed 10, 000kms.after that I met with an argument with them.",Suzuki
Fuel Consumption:- Well you will be surprised that company claims that gixxer on road avg is around 60.,Suzuki
"Fuel Efficiency is quit good. looks is Not so adorable, handling also good but still disappointing when riding on off-road.",Suzuki
"Fuel consumption is not good as its displacement is 155cc, it goes 30 km/liter in city and 35km/liter on highway .",Suzuki
Fuel economy is also good I also want to buy this bike bt I dont have money if I have money to buy any bike I will buy this bike.,Suzuki
"Fuel- on highways the mileage is at around 50 kmpl, and in the cities thats around 40-43 kmpl.",Suzuki

"GIXXER is India’s first Street Sport bike which comes with a powerful 155cc engine powered by cutting edge SEP technology, unmatched features, unique styling and a chassis developed by the engineers who designed the legendary GSX-R series for great riding performance.",Suzuki
GIXXER is a sporty motorcycle with functional beauty combining edgy styling and performance with an exhilarating and sporty ride. It is a machine that Suzuki’s engineers have tuned to produce broad low-end torque and dynamic mid-range power for strong acceleration and sporty handling.,Suzuki
"Gear gets stuck sometimes when shifting from top to bottom level. For ex. when changing from 3rd to 2nd level, it gets stuck between 3 and 2 and need to press one more time to move it to 2. And",Suzuki
Gear position is good all the features is better in Battery is 12V and 3AH is Good than other bike.,Suzuki
"Gear shifting in Gixxer SF is really a tough task, especially when you are gearing down to 1st for initial pick up after a speed drop. Instead of a quick gear down and raising the speed you will end up in adjusting the lever up and down to find the next gear.!",Suzuki
Generally the specification includes. Certainly it consist of an displacement of about(154.9CC). And provides a maximum power of about(14.6Bhp) and a torque of about(14 nm). It is a 5 geared bike with at most one cylinder inserted with it. Fuel tank capacity is of about(12 litres) and a bike can reach a maximum speed upto(127 kilometer per hour).,Suzuki
Gives attractive look while we ride and we can have a very good control on this bike.And it is light weight and mostly preffered by youngstars.its design is awesome and gives a posh look.I recommend people to use this because am already experincing the craziest rides with this bike.,Suzuki
Gixer is a bike which is made by the cpany suzuki. In gixer their are two models of the bike. One with out fareing and other with fareing. Both of the model with and without fareing looks decent from all the bikes. The style of the silencer is uniquecally designed by the engenierrs. It is a very good bike in the budget price of a common man. In the fareing bike it has only one colour combination that is blue and little white but in with out fareing it has many options of the color. I like this bike very much. Thank you,Suzuki
"Gixer is a nice bike from Suzuki. It costs around 85, 000 rupees, ex show room price in delhi. The best part is the stunning looks especially with accessories n wings, so perfect for college guys. Girls can easily fall for a guy with fixer. Fuel consumption is a bit high, mileage is average. Good comfortable vehicle. Ergonomics are really good n worth appreciation.",Suzuki
Gixer sf is gixer with full fairing thought weight is increased but due to its aerodynamic nature it helps to improve the performance although not much but higher topspeed of 130. The moto gp. Edition is expensive by 4k but it worth the price. The other colours are black and white but blue looks best. Now it has a rear disc break version too. Although I like it if it comes with optional ABS. The acceleration is not brisk but ya you will not feel its 150cc engine. The bike is nimble and has excellent handling capabilities. The bike shows its true colors when you throw it into any corner. The aerodynamic nature helps it and makes bike stable at higher speed,Suzuki
"Gixxer SF Engine is 4 -Stroke, 1-Cylinder, Air Cooled, SOHC, 2 Valve, his Maximum Speed= 127 kmph, Displacement 127 Kmph, Starting type is Self Start Only.

So Gixxer SF Engine & performance is wonderful and great to his price.",Suzuki
"Gixxer SF carries the spirit of the Moto GP racing. It's impressive design below 1 lakh is a positive point. It has all digital instruments which consists of a speedometer, tachometer, odometer, trip meter and a digital fuel gauge etc.",Suzuki
"Gixxer SF comes with the affordable price of 97,700rs(depends on the cty).",Suzuki
Gixxer SF gains credit of being an affordable package based on the naked street version of the Gixxer. The design of the Gixxer SF is derived from the massive GSX models in the lineup of Suzuki.,Suzuki
"Gixxer SF has all in it to be a life-long, uncomplaining, low-maintenance companion. Just take proper care of it and the dividends would be highly rewarding.",Suzuki
"Gixxer SF houses the same engine that powers the naked version. The 154.9cc, single cylinder engine puts out top power and torque of 14.6bhp at 8000rpm and 14Nm at 6000rpm respectively.",Suzuki
"Gixxer SF is a rev-happy machine and the bike likes to be revved hard. However, I won’t recommend anyone to do it so heavy city traffic.",Suzuki
Gixxer SF is designed in the same windd tunnel as the mighty hayabusa did. Suzuki also made the hayabusa like same key for the gixxer. The key itself will make you a proud owner of the mighty GSX series bike.,Suzuki
"Gixxer SF is one of the most good looking mid-range priced bike. It has awesome grapical exterior.and digital back-lit dial to see speed and fuel capacity.Suzuki Gixxer is a 154.9 cc motorcycle.It’s 4-stroke, 1-cylinder, air-cooled.Flaunt your unmatched style with its fascinating new colour combinations – Blue/White and Black/Red. It has alloy wheels and tubeless tyres. It is a very good bike looking at the price at which it is available.",Suzuki
Gixxer SF is the fully faired version of naked gixxer.It is the best fully faired bike in this price segment.The look is superb.The exhuast looks stunning.I love this bike very much.Realibility and quality is top.The led tail light looks cool.Handling is good.Comfort is awesome.With Suzuki SEP technology it gives 50km/litre fuel consumption,Suzuki
Gixxer SF is the most stylish bike in this price range and its called as a turn heads bike. Some negative points are there like:,Suzuki
"Gixxer SF shares its headlight design with the elders of Suzuki family, especially the Hayabusa's triangular design.",Suzuki
"Gixxer SF shares its headlight design with the elders of Suzuki family, especially the Hayabusa's triangular design. An impressive design below 1 lakh is a positive point for the newcomer as the price fully justifies its beauty. It's a tough enemy for every 150 cc rival. Whether it's Yamaha R15 or the Pulsar RS200, Suzuki has targeted every faired bike of each category. The resemblance of the SF to the track racers will push it to a new height. Other rivals of this bike are Hero Karizma ZMR and Honda CBR150R. Though none of these are direct rivals of Gixxer SF but still we can count all of them as a competition as these are fully-faired bikes and are priced below 1.25 lakhs ( ex-showroom price) .",Suzuki
Gixxer Sf is very comfortable for both the persons rider as well as the back seater because the back seat is contineous not tall like other bikes. As a bike has seat then the back seater always has in fear of dropping down. Therefore as gixxer sf is having contineous seat the backseater can seat fearlessly.,Suzuki
"Gixxer as can be seen from the above images provides a great sportylook which is enough to attract anyones attention. Along with the great sporty look it also provides great performance with a powerful enging of 155c under the price range of 85k. Being a semi sports bike, it still ensures a mileage of 55kmpl which makes it stand out.",Suzuki
Gixxer front wheel of the new 100 section 140 section of the unit while the unit is back. Both tires are 17-inch alloy wheel fixes. Fully digital instrument console has been installed in Gixxer.,Suzuki
Gixxer has 4 stroke 2 valve air cooled engine which produces a very descent power.Suzuki Gixxer kills by its looks and is probably the cheapest bike in its fragments.It has a 154.9 cc engine which gives a good average of 50-55 probably the most in its class.It gives the rider good ride as well and I am using it since 6 monts and didnt have found any complain yet.,Suzuki
"Gixxer is a sporty motorcycle with functional beauty combining edgy styling and performance with an excellent sporty riding.the best part is the stunning looks especially with accessories and wings.fuel consumption is a bit high, mileage is average, good comfortable vehicle.i recommend this bike for guys but for younger generation.head lights and tail lights are good.service of suzuki is quite good un indua though the spare parts and acessories of the bike are a bit dificult to find in market.i reccomend thus bike for youngsters.",Suzuki
Gixxer is better then the other bike of suzuki its abest choice for sports bike lover and its very comfortable and its mileage is good its for a bike lover and its looks are very good and very comfortable and its heavy and its handling is good its best choice for those who love long drive and its best. this bike setting arrangements is very good you fill comfortable when you ride a bike and go for long drive or drive in the city and it is also a best choice for sports bike lover and statements.,Suzuki

Gixxer sf according to prices its really reliable 84 thousand rupees gonna get gud street style bike with gud performance,Suzuki
"Gixxer sf does not vibrate even on top speeds.In my experience I rode it at 125 kmph and did not feel any vibration.This speaks the volume of comfort in this bike, however the pillion seat is really uncomfortable and could give you a sore butt.",Suzuki
Gixxer sf give milage 51 kmpl. The no. Of top speed gear is 5. It's wheel is alloy type wheel.,Suzuki
Gixxer sf has digital speedometer which is great to watch at which condittion we ride a bike. if you are looking for sport bike in budget about 1 lac. giixer sf is beat another bike.,Suzuki
Gixxer sf has the mileage of 65 on showroom and 50 to 55 on road which I have noted from my friend's new gixxer sf 155cc gray colour bike. In traffic it is near about 50 but not less than this. My friend always says me on his calculation of kilometers that bike can run x kilometers with this remaining petrol i.e the bike follows calculated values for mileage.,Suzuki

HOPE MY REVIEW ON GIXXER SF WILL HELP YOU IN CHOSING A GOOD SPORTS BIKE.,Suzuki
Hai.!hello.friends am abhi.good evening .here am telling you about,Suzuki
Handling and comfort of the bike is average but but for a 155cc bike its more than enough.,Suzuki
Handling and control:- yup if you look at it as a sports bike than handing is not like a sports bike means it is having normal handling but comfortable. 3/5,Suzuki
"Handling and controlling system this bike is good, but this bike price money is very high this reason this bike not many buyer and seller and availability this bike in the market no more.",Suzuki
Handling for gixxer is awesome. Tnx for the wide rear tyre. Brakeing is good but not excellent.,Suzuki
Handling is top of the class. The lightweight chasis and wider tires aids great handling.,Suzuki
Handling of this bike is very good as I have ride on it so then there I have come to know that handling of a good bike and handling of a bad quality bike is this different types .,Suzuki
"Handling — Handling of the bike is top notch, you will never feel tired riding in city traffic",Suzuki
He ride the bike past9 months and there is no high maintenance.,Suzuki
"Hello Friends.Today I want to explain about my experience about Suzuki Gixxer SF bike, It's one of good Bike for racing and Suzuki is one of old and famous bikes company in Indian When my Brother bought this bike and I get the chance for rider then I am feeling it's one of fast bike and it's average around 50 kmz per litter and it's 150 CC bike, It's pickup very fast and it's look cool so I recommend to everyone for test arrive and buy this bike.",Suzuki
"Hello Guys! This is one of my Favourate 150cc Bike ever, I have'd purchased it almost 3-4 months ago, The Bike is very Superb, Superb design by Suzuki, both Faired and a Naked one, But I don't like about Gixxer that Suzuki has usen all fibre material over there and the worst part is Mirror it don't looks cool at all, If the suzuki had given the mirror like Pulsar 220F it will be look preety cool, But not an issue its look cool even when you are not using the mirror and keeping it folded inside, and another worst part I don't like that If you goes above 75 kmph the RPM gets blink, I don't know why Suzuki has given this system, If you are going a long journey it will frustrate you, and the engine also gets heated quickly and takes a long time to cool down, And I personally don't feel the lack of 6th gear, When riding on a highway, The bike goes 117 kmph what I was rode, I have seen couple of reviews in that it shows it can goes 127 kmph which is more enough, What you can expect more than that by a 155cc bike, The best part I like about the bike is Handling, Comfort handling for both a city rider and as well as highway rider as comare to Yamaha R15 the handle is at the perfect distance  from the seat whereas riding Yamaha R15  the back gets pain a lot, Its a best bike under 1 lakh as compare to Honda Hornet, Yamaha FZS V2, Yamaha Fazer, by the way Its your choice guys but I personally think and suggest you to go with this bike, Ok Thankyou Guys, I hope you like my review and I think the review will be helpful for you!",Suzuki
"Hello Guys, Now I am review about the wonderful bike, that is SUZUKI GIXXER SF. It is fully-faired premium commuter motorcycle, which is based on the Gixxer naked motorcycle. My college mate have this bike in 2016. First I did't like this bike.",Suzuki
"Hello Mates, I was looking to buy a new bike for myself and I had compared bikes like Hero Karizma ZMR, Yamaha FZ 2.0 and Finally Suzuki Gixxer SF.Now let me tell you the reasons why I chose Gixxer SF.a) Karizma ZMR is a 220 cc bike and because of that the mileage was very low, also I wanted a good looking bike to ride in city and you cannot enjoy 220 cc engine when you are driving in city, so the 220 digit was out of game for me, then came price, being 220 cc it was obviously more costly than Gixxer, one more point was there, The Fairing on Karizma is not fully covered, but in Gixxer the Fair covers the front panel. Also the tank design and 3D logo of suzuki gives Gixxer a more sleek look than ZMR. Now coming to the Head Lights, Gixxer Headlights are inspired from Suzuki's very own The Muscular Hayabusa and so the front look is awesome and combinig it with full faired body gives it a look way more expensive than it actually is, but in ZMR the front look is not that impressive.b) I went to look Yamaha FZ 2.0. The bike is very cool and also muscular but what I found annoying is that there is no kick in it and so if your self-misbehaved, you will have to drag that muscular bike to the workshop, also they included some new technology because of that there is no petrol control for reserve, off and on. SO by any chance you miss the fuel station, you will not be able to use the reserve petrol in emergency and you have to drag it again. Both these problems are not there in Gixxer.c) Keeping these things in mind and also the price range, I opted Suzuki Gixxer. Now let me share my experience with this bike.I am using this bike from January 2016 and drove it more than 18000 km, I am very happy with the way it responds, the pickup is still awesome after 1.5 Years, the battery I got is original Exide from the company and its very healthy and responsive even in winters. The MRF tyres are still strong and there are only 2 punctures till date. The headlight flashes very good and so the pass signal. The seats are fine not very comfortable but they do the job pretty decently. The driving posture is very balanced and you won't feel any back strain. The breaks work appropriately.Now lets break these over view into numbers.1) Mileage: This bike is a 155 cc( 154.8 to be exact) engine bike and also weighs more than 130 kgs, so it was natural for me to think that it will not give an average more than 35 kmpl. But you guys will be shocked to know that its giving me a mileage of 42-48 kmpl in city. To tell you, Im not a rash driver, I drive mostly under 50 kmph and use the 5th gear very rarely, also I get it serviced at the correct date.2) Comfort wise I will give it a 7 out of 10. The posture is good, The foot rest are fine, just the seats are a little deep where the tank originates and you may find a feeling to take a break if you are driving it for more than an hour.3) The bike is completely reliable, the engine sound is beautiful and the tubeless tyres make it unstoppable, the balancing is awesome, the center of gravity is at a low point due to weight, the air cutting sharp point below the headlight keeps it to the ground and the wide tyres kiss the ground with much affection, So no chances of slipping unless you are doing some stunts.4) The road grip is very cool, even on turns the bike performs absolutely flawless, no screeching, no slipping and I have driven over 120kmph it always feel like you are stick to the ground, so the grip is very decent.5) The overall appeal of this bike is 9.5/10. I like it very much, reasons being price, style, looks, control, balance, mileage and looks. The pedestrians still give it a look when I pass by and its still a great feeling.Its a complete value of money and in my opinion, you should go for it.Thanks",Suzuki

"Hello frnds I just want to tell you I was suggested to buy it as I'm fat(102 kgs, 5'11ft). But had to sell it because of non touring(was doing my MBA). Finally I got a 155 cc bike from Suzuki with my own money this March(still a student at the time of purchase) GSX 150F or Gixxer SF. I went for it because I had 1.10 on hand so couldn't wait or didn't wait to get R15 or RC 200.(not interested in CBR 150 and RS 200) Couldn't test drive it as there were none available for test drives. So I had to make the decision my just sitting on it in the showroom. Paid cash, generated bill and other documents, filled 1 litre petrol(complimentary from Suzuki) and rode home. Bike fell on the 1st hour of my purchase as I was engaging side stand after halting in my garage and there was piece of marble on which I laid the side stand and didn't notice it was slipping. I fell and the bike fell on me. The left indicator broke off and was hanging. Got up and found no damage on the fairing. Clutch lever got scratches on the rounded end. Fixed indicator with Fevikwik. Great 1st day. After this I knew nothing would happen to the fairings even if it fell. Bike fell like 3 times now. No damage on the fairings, but yes back plastic of the mirror and clutch lever's ends got scratched. I put stickers on the bike and put on LED neons, gear socket protector, throttle control engager, tank pad and a saree stand for my mother to sit on the seat sideways and voila! I have a bike that everyone turns their heads to see while I'm riding.this bike is very good you should purchase.",Suzuki

I am from Aurangabad I have gixer bike since 1 year starting days performance is was well. now I m facing problem in my bike seating gear shiffting,Suzuki
"I am little bit confuse about my first bike.And I started taking suggestions from other Some people Says go for Yamaha Fz, R15 and so on.So I suddenly look at a bike and Start finding Infromation about it.and a next day I bought it from my hometown at the cost of 105000.It really a good bike and Don't Go for its fiber body it is must stronger than your think.I millege is not so good.about 30 km per liter.but over all performace was good as campared to other bike with this ranges and look.I like most in this bike is A reserve fuel tank in emergency.and a kick which is not mentions in other bike with this range.I like this bike very much it is better than R15.if you are a good biker go for it",Suzuki
I am looking for buy bike which is mid range and sport look best mileage and comfortable for ride,Suzuki
I am not recommending this bike since it has lots of lagging compared to bikes at its price.,Suzuki
"I am quite astonished by the excellent pickup of GixerSF, however its engine stops in between during a slow run, I will suggest not to ride this bike too slow because this is a superfast racing bike, one could enjoy the real essence while riding it at a speed more than 70kmph. and moreover the drifting is awesome, the diameter of the tires is less as compared to other sports bike but this contributes in drifting purpose. One can feel the coolness and smartness of the bike while drifting . it is very driver-friendly, in the sense that a novice can also ride this bike without any issue or problems. Fuel of rs100 would take the bike run 30kms at a long run.",Suzuki
I am really happy that I got a beast vehicle that really a monster and driving experince like a bullet its really smoth to drive and suspensions are really good with a good torque and pickup is very good I get about 40 to 42 km/liter Its a good mileage isnt it ? .Ibgot this bike on 1st aug 2016 now its 24th day im using and performance is same asvthe first day. I think my bike vibrate a littil bit.and also the .ain problem if u buy a suzukis bike the bike care centre is worst in vidharbh amravti not like honda. But in this price range this bike is best and good looking sports bike do not think much just buy it and enjoy !,Suzuki
I am really super fan of this bike. I like this bike very much due to its fuel consumption. Its runs very smooth with a gravity. When I ride this bike I think that I drive a BMW car. It is so comfortable to ride. Now a days Suzuki Zixxer SF one the best bike in reliable price. Handling and control power this bike is awesome and so lucrative. When It move on the way everyone turn their head toward the bike.Every one attract for his nice outlook. Its front side looks like a lion jumping towards me.I just say one words that it is awesome.,Suzuki
"I am reviewing this bike after using this bike for about three months. It is a nice looking bike people will turn back for looking this bike, when you take it to the streets, it is very much comfortable. Hats off to Suzuki for making such a beautiful bike at such affordable price. This bike will cost you around 90 K( ex showroom DELHI) . It has a maximum speed of 135 km/hr and has a torque of around 8 bhp. This bike has a double nossle air filter and produces a nice sound. The bike will give you a mileage of 50 km/L and after having 2 services it can give upto 55 km/L. What I like about this bike is that it has many varieties like moto GP edition, rear disc etc. The normal Suzuki gixxer SF has disc brakes in front and drum brake in rear. What I dislike about this bike is its Headlight. Well it's upto you but from my side you should go for this bike.This bike has its own pros and cons",Suzuki
"I am riding Suzuki Gixxer SF since one year and covered around 13500 km so far. Very few bikes, can match Gixxer SF's handling prowess. Gixxer  SF does not vibrate at top speed. I rode it at 100 kmph and did not feel any vibration, that speaks of the volume of comfort the bike offers.",Suzuki
I am riding the Suzuki Gixxer SF for the last 8 months. The bike has a combination of a class sporty look and riding comfort. The bike is a beast in power. The roads of my area have many ups and downs but the bike never gives any complaint. The bike has 5 gears transmition and my bike have touched the highest speed of 119kmph. The body curves are beautiful and the 155 cc engine gives you enough power to climb at any hilltop. Mileage is also good. It gives me 35 to 37 kmpl. Overall I am happy with the performance of the bike. One drawback of tge bike is tgat it doesnt have the auto choke you have to manually pull the liver to choke the bike and then you also have to release the choke after the bike is ready. But the choke is only needed in the winter time. One advantage of this bike is that it have both kick start and electric start.,Suzuki
I am riding this bike almost 5-6 months approx.This bike is best for this price segments.And bigger surprice is for me that in that price range I have fully faired bike.This bike is far better bike than other manufactures in that price range.The engine is very smooth and I am getting a milege approx 35 KMPL.The bike handle is slight high for that the comfort is much better compairing to other full faired bikes.In 5-6 months riding the bike is never vibrate or never faults the reliability is also too good.It tyres is much superior for the road and grips just fine in rainy condition.I am using this bike and I will suggest you to buy that bike because its low price range and bigger performance,Suzuki
"I am sharing my experience with you. This is different from motorcycle and motorcycle, this bike has a disc brake on either side, the company has given this motorcycle enough look. This motorcycle covers a distance of 2 kilometers in 1 kg of petrol and it does not take much time to catch its top seeped. On this motorcycle, two people can travel a comfortable bad road.",Suzuki
"I am still very much enjoying the ride and this month I find myself appreciating the Gixxer riding position. Not so much for your comfort or sportiness, but because of how well you can hold the motorcycle. Flares were exaggerated in the tank and heel plates taller riders are also very functional, close to the knees work well. While you with the center of your foot from heel plates eliminate more enjoyable, it's still much better than most other motorcycles grip.",Suzuki
"I am using GIXXER from last 2 mounths.i like it a lot. The best part in the bike isits look. I like it alot. it has a better look then any other avilable in market. thhe pickup of the bike is so fast which is a very good feature yrr. sitting of bike is quite disappointing . it has fully digital meter which is other thing, it shows speed, fuel quantity as well as the time also.so friends dont waste your money on any other thing instead of this tremendous bike.",Suzuki
"I am using gixxer sf for 8 months and I crossed 10, 000kms.everything is fine but front disc brake had problem in 6, 500 kms.front wheel becomes tight due to friction in disc brake.i have checked for oil and other basic things but sitll the problem is there.in service centre they said disc plate has bent and they said they will replace it within 25 days.",Suzuki
"I am using gixxer sf for 8 months and I crossed 40, 000kms.everything is fine but front disc brake had problem in 3, 5000 kms.",Suzuki
"I am using gixxer sf from about 1 year, and I am facing some engine problem , In starting months it feels very puchy and fuel effecient but after 1st servicing its engine start sounding some crappy sounds as the engine starts to burn very quickly and when I go to the service centre they fill engine oil and told me to run 200km on it and come again to check it . After 200km it again starts to burn engine oil quickly , when I visit the service centre again they just ignores the problem I am facing and again fill up the engine oil as the previuosly they done. After some time I visit to a local garage and tell them my problem, they checked the problem and told me that my engine's piston head gets a fault thats why my bike burns engine oil quickly . So on my personal opinion I will not suggest you guys to buy this bike .",Suzuki
I am using sujuki gixxer sf for 1 and a half year.really good bike. feels like high budget bike. suspension are great but not easy to handle for it's weight . good pickup.great speed.smooth engine.

"I bought my first bike in 2016 when it was newly come.I saw a poster of the Suzuki Gixxer SF and went to showroom to see the bike.Before see this bike, I i was a fan of Yamaha FZ but later Suzuki's Gixxer SF became my crush.So I ask my father to buy this bike because it is very good in its sporty look, design and colour.The shape and design of this bike is copied by Suzuki's Hayabusa.So I bought this bike in black colour and it is so shiny.My dream of first bike became true. The performance of bike is very good.It is also comfortable and the mileage of this bike is very good.",Suzuki

"I bought this bike a year ago, a very good mileage of 46-48kmpl in city and 52kmpl or little more on highways on an average speed of 70kmph. The performance is good, ground clearance is really good, comfortable for long driving, the twin silencer and the bulky tyre makes it look good from back side, side looks are not very impressive, there is no rear disc in previous version which I have, front look is little bulky and gives good look, for city ride there is no problem at all and the only problem is with the mirrors in the city traffic but rest a very good bike at a good price, there is no good sound in the bike which doesn't let u feel as a sports bike. Front light is just of 35W which is not at all comfortable, talking about the servicing charges I was charged Rs.540/- per each free service and paid service is likely to be around 900/-.",Suzuki
I bought this bike after saving and it is worth every single rupee I saved. This bike is amazing and it is so smooth to drive and it is fuel economy is good as well.,Suzuki
I bought this bike after selling my previous Suzuki GS 150r which I used for 4yrs n it was a very good bike. So last year I decided to upgrade to a more modern and stylish bike and being a Suzukian for past 4yrs I decided to bought the Gixxer SF. Now with Gixxer SF I am quite satisfied with its performance and handling when compair to GS150 but one thing I have notice is the built quality of this bike which have gone down compair to GS150 infact GS150 was one of the best built bike in its category but with Gixxer Suzuki has reduce the quality for unknown reason may be cost cutting but dint expect this from a company like Suzuki.,Suzuki

I don't understand why Suzuki has given such a poor and bad looking stickers all over. The colour contrast choosed is very very ugly.,Suzuki
I dont like look of this bike as per its performance. Gixxer have a bad look and graphics given on body of it. Nice in performance. Pic up is nice and avrage is low but all over  good performance but some of fiber body and bad curve and back side hight is  giving bad design to this bike.,Suzuki

I have use this bike the bike is very good and nice. This is the best bike in the market under 150cc. In terms mileage speed pick up and what not. Pick is better than any bike in this range. This maybe one of the most under rated bike in the market. One bad thing about the bike would be the group clearance which is very low and would it the speed breaker all the time. The bike will good graphic and stylish and it is good to ride 5 gera in this bike and the bike is used to long trip the bike speed will be 120 km/hr,Suzuki

Ok I like this suzuky is best bike mAker com,Suzuki
"I liked this bike from many bikes and I have compared them for youI chose Gixxer SF. a) Karizma ZMR is a 220 cc bike and because of that the mileage was very low, also I wanted a good looking bike to ride in city and you cannot enjoy 220 cc engine when you are driving in city, so the 220 digit was out of game for me, then came price, being 220 cc it was obviously more costly than Gixxer, one more point was there, The Fairing on Karizma is not fully covered, but in Gixxer the Fair covers the front panel. Also the tank design and 3D logo of suzuki gives Gixxer a more sleek look than ZMR. Now coming to the Head Lights, Gixxer Headlights are inspired from Suzuki’s very own The Muscular Hayabusa and so the front look is awesome and combinig it with full faired body gives it a look way more expensive than it actually is, but in ZMR the front look is not that impressive. b) I went to look Yamaha FZ 2.0. The bike is very cool and also muscular but what I found annoying is that there is no kick in it and so if your self misbehaved, you will have to drag that muscular bike to the workshop, also they included some new technology because of that there is no petrol control for reserve, off and on. SO by any chance you miss the fuel station, you will not be able to use the reserve petrol in emergency and you have to drag it again. Both these problems are not there in Gixxer. c) Keeping these things in mind and also the price range, I opted Suzuki Gixxer. Now let me share my experience with this bike. I am using this bike from January 2016 and drove it more than 18000 km, I am very happy with the way it responds, the pickup is still awesome after 1.5 Years, the battery I got is original Exide from company and its very healthy and responsive even in winters. The MRF tyres are still strong and there are only 2 punctures till date. The headlight flashes very good and so the pass signal. The seats are fine not very comfortable but they do the job pretty decently. The driving posture is very balanced and you wont feel any back strain. The breaks works appropriately. Now lets break these over view into numbers. 1) Mileage: This bike is a 155 cc(154.8 to be exact) engine bike and also weighs more than 300 kgs, so it was natural for me to think that it will not give an average more than 35 kmpl. But you guys will be shocked to know that its giving me a mileage of 42-48 kmpl in city. To tell you, Im not a rash driver, I drive mostly under 50 kmph and use the 5th gear very rarely, also I get it serviced at the correct date. 2) Comfort wise I will give it a 7 out of 10. The posture is good, The foot rest are fine, just the seats are a little deep where the tank originates and you may find a feeling to take a break if you are driving it for more than an hour. 3) The bike is completely reliable, the engine sound is beautiful and the tubeless tyres make it unstoppable, the balancing is awesome, the center of gravity is at a low point due to weight, the air cutting sharp point below the headlight keeps it to the ground and the wide tyres kiss the ground with much affection, So no chances of slipping unless you are doing some stunts. 4) The road grip is very cool, even on turns the bike performs absolutely flawless, no screeching, no slippingand I have drove over 120kmph it always feel like you are stick to the ground, so the grip is very decent. 5) The overall appeal of this bike is 7.5/10. I like it very much, reasons being price, style, looks, control, balance, mileage and looks. The pedestrians still give it a look when I pass by and its still a great feeling. So overall a great buy for sport bike lovers",Suzuki
I likewise feel that the Gixxer SF could have looked somewhat better from the front. Suzuki has held the headlamp from the bare bicycle and I think it looks a tiny bit excessively limit for the bike general.,Suzuki
"I live in mumbai. I have taken this bike to alibaug, daman, lonavla and many places, I can ride it perfectly anywhere without any problem,",Suzuki
"I love this bike, I m using this bike from last one year I this bike is just awesome the great milage and the great looks.?? and the comfort of bike is really good the seating positon was very good.handling is best for indian roads on a very low price bike giving us the great looks like a racing bike only the maintace cost is higher it gives me in 1 litre maximum 50 km in highay and 40-45 in traffic and because of its good handling I love this bike.",Suzuki
I m the great lover of bikes. As compare to other bikes gixxer series is not good in any conditions looks speed and etc.,Suzuki
I mainly love the features of bike and I prefer to all have to have this bike.This bike is good and all features is also good and engine is better,Suzuki
"I mean when we talk about features then we get a powerfull 155 cc engine, a twin exhaust, a sporty and elegant look",Suzuki
I must say that if you want stylish with long millage bike then you will have to buy Suzuki Gixxer Sf.,Suzuki
I never wanted to buy naked bike so I got two options Suzuki Gixxer Sf & Yamaha Fazer V2,Suzuki
I own Suzuki Gixxer SF. It is carburetor base bike. The thing I loved in this bike that is its mileage. In a city it gives mileage 47 kmpl to 50 kmpl and in a highways it gives mileage above the 50kmpl. It is good as compared to other competitors of suzuki gixxer sf. Headlights is not pretty good. On the upper lamp it is difficult to ride in a dark. This is sporty look bike but it will not give you sport bike performance. As it is 150 segment bike with 5 gear engine. Main benefits for this bike is its price. It is not expensive bike when it comes to sport look bike. Overall at the rate of 1 lakh it is best bike to buy.,Suzuki
"I own this bike from Suzuki, I have to travel a very long distance every day and I love to ride this as this is an awesome bike. I like its braking and an amazing road grip. I loved the style and performance of this bike. It has a got a descent mileage and better road grip which gives me an extra courage to accelerate this bike a bit faster. This bike is extremely well built as stated by tariff. The price of the bike is not too expensive and thus provides for a good ride at an affordable rate. I bought this bike purposely because I like the looks and the feel when I ride this bike in the weekends. The braking system is very good and it works efficiently provided with good articulated disc brakes. Solid material is used for the body.",Suzuki
I owned suzuki gixxer sf last year its been more than one year now the thing which I like in my bikd is looks I love tbe way its look the bike is 150cc which is very good its can go 60km/hour in just 7 sec and in gixxer the sitting comfort is very good. We can easily go for long road trip with good comfort. The average of this bike is also very good my bike gives average about 45 km /litre km highways and on city road the average of this bike is about 40km/litre overall this bike in this price section its a perfect bike with good comfort looks average brakes. Its a overall package of sport bike,Suzuki
I owned this bike before one year it is really good the pick up power of this bike is awesome it can reach up to 125 high speed with 5 geras. It's 155 cc Suzuki introduce a good and stylish bike in market in comparison to others company bike. Its blue colour model is really attractive if u want to buy a bike in 150 segment you can check this bike for a one time.,Suzuki
I personally own this bike for 1 year.It is good bike within 92k( onroad price kolkata) .It is a fully faird bike weigh 139kg.Gear shift is not so good it is very clunky after one year it dosen't change too much. I get milage of 45kmpl I set my carb in richer side.The engine is 155cc aircooled. The engine is almost viberation free but little bit vibration is felt on foot pegs and handels over 7000 rpm. In high speed condition certain wind blow from side can cause littelbit disblance due to the fairing.It not compairable to sportsbike like yamah r15. Although it is a good entry level bike for daily commute but can't say fully sport bike because it has no no clip on handel bar but Very good product from suzuki . Style is very good it is truely grabs attention.,Suzuki
I personally used this bike and I can say this bike is uncomfortable for long ride due to its hard seat although sitting position is good.,Suzuki
"I purchase this bike about a year ago and I think that it was the biggest mistake of my life, this bike cost me around rs 90, 000.",Suzuki
"I purchased this bike around a year ago a gosh this bike give you double what you have paid for. The main point of the bike is the looks and styling is just wow and not just cosmetics but also being degined in the same wind tunell where the big bosses of the moto GP bikes of Suzuki is made. The total ride comfort, dynamics, handling and control of the bike is just awesome and has no match in the price segment. I am getting around 40+ on city ride and 45+ on highways.",Suzuki
I purchased this bike on 1st January 2016. I read more than 100 reviews and watched more than 25 videos about this bike. But after I purchased this bike mileage is very good I got some 61.6 per litre in high ways and 53 in city traffic Bangalore.,Suzuki
"I purchased this bike on Feb-29-2016 it's one year completed, I don't have any intention to spoil Suzuki reputation while writing reviews, why I am writing this review because I am completely upset with what the service they are provided, from, after 3 months of purchase I received engine abnormal  sound immediately I given servicing in TC palya, Bangalore this was the 3rd service then after one week again engine sound starts but I have not absorb carefully after one month suddenly huge abnormal sound came can't able to run the vehicle, I stopped vehicle gave to kolar Suzuki service center they repaired engine after 8days, they told me crank shaft and bearing and timing chains completely broken, in the previous service they have not assembly properly  that's y it happened like this, after this service again after 3 months complaints started so I decided to give on outside for servicing I given it they told me cam shaft and timing chain not properly assembled thats y it's engine sound is coming.service not good not satisfied .Now I have  given my bike in suzuki service center Domlur for servicing they are telling warranty not able to claim to ur bike, one thing I understood if suzuki bike manufacturer in one year this so many complaints, if we purchase a mobile for 10k it will work without any problem for at least one year, but in suzuki bike  In my life Time I will not purchase this Suzuki brand. Now I am not asking for engine replacement only servicing they can provide at  free of cost because of their servicing problem only my bike produced this much sound, I will not choose Suzuki brand in my life time .",Suzuki
"I purchased this bike one year ago, In the starting, I was really in love with the bike, I woke up whole night just to ride my bike. I must say that the seating comfort is very good on this bike. Also, the body positioning is very good. You can ride this bike on long routes without producing harm to your lower back.",Suzuki
I purchased this in last 4 months and the bike is full filled of power and meter of bike is fully digital and the sound is superb when bike is coming speedly so sound was listneable.but some demerits are the is full of plastic body is the front is broken so the company give option that you nai have to change full front.the broken part can be removed so this a good feature and service provide by company was nice,Suzuki
I recommend if you want to update power and torque in less fuel consumption so this bike is very good and perfect for you.,Suzuki
"I recommend this bike for guys but for younger generation. Head Lights and tail lights are good. The brand itself says it all, no need of much reviews. Services of Suzuki is quite good in India though the spare parts and accessories of the bike are a bit difficult to find in market but can be brought from bigger showrooms. Rest everything is good. My friend has brought it around 6 months ago, n he is happy with his decision. I recommend bike for youngsters.",Suzuki
I recommend this type of bikes who are looking to show the style segment.,Suzuki
I recommend you this bike just because of its style and its powerful engine,Suzuki

I want to tell that please don't purchase This bike of suzuki it is worst .,Suzuki
I was looking for a sports bike from a long time and this brand is enough fro sports. It doesn?™t need any explanation about the bike if you hear its brand. Its an awesome 150cc bike with a very good mileage. I loved its style and looks which can make any one go crazy about it. After riding this bike I even don?™t check any more option in market. With Suzuki brand name it completely satisfies me.,Suzuki
I was looking to buy 150cc bike recently so I tested & take test drives of every single 150cc bike available in Indian Market.,Suzuki
I was the owner of suzuki showroom in rania for 2 years.So I can tell you much better then others.,Suzuki
I will complete my review with following list and if this list is your priority then you should buy this bike,Suzuki
I will purchase suzuki gixxer 1 year ago. Very good mileage and perfomance.it is very comfort alle seat . It's look like a sports bike.i have 50-55 km/ltr . It's top speed is 110km /hr. It is very good grippable.This is the best selection of 150cc category .,Suzuki
I will share my experience about this bike. Actually I wanted to buy a bike that is full framed body and also fuel efficient and also its on my budget.then I got to know that this bike is cheap and good performance bike.,Suzuki
I will suggest to go for the SF model than the normal one because there is a huge difference in looks.,Suzuki
I won’t write much about the looks as everyone accepts and acknowledges that it is one of the most attractive bikes(especially the Blue MotoGP edition) out there.,Suzuki
I'm a user of gixxer sp sf . That is the specil edition of gixxer . Which is greay in color. It is a fabulous bike I really love it.,Suzuki
IF YOU ARE A RACER AND LOVE AN SPORTS BIKE THEN YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY GO FOR THIS THIS BIKE YOU WILL FALL IN LOVE WITH THIS BIKE .,Suzuki
"INSTRUMENT CONSOLE:-SPEEDOMETER, TRIPMETER, ODOMETER, TECHOMETER(DIGITAL)",Suzuki
IT IS A VERY GOOD BIKE. IT IS VERY COMFORTABLE IN SITTING. IT IS AVAILABLE IN MANY COLORS.,Suzuki
If I say about rider comfort then its good but once I sat back as pillion and the comfort is not up-to the mark.,Suzuki
If I talk about its average it's good it's nice it's mileage is good it's looks is awesome it's handling is pretty much awesome it seat is cool and comfortable tyres grip is pretty much safe and well. Overall it's like a dream bike not much costly and great also .,Suzuki
"If factor 2 is longer than the result field, the excess leftmost characters of factor 2 are not moved. If the result field is longer than factor 2, the excess leftmost characters in the result field are unchanged, unless padding is specified.",Suzuki
"If factor 2 is shorter than the length of the result field, a P specified in the operation extender position(position 53) causes the result field to be padded on the left after the move occurs.",Suzuki
"If u are searching for the sport bike with low pricing than this bike is for you. this bike offers you great handling. We had ridden this bike all the way from Rajkot to Surat. The roads are straight and smooth so we decided to take this bike to off-road, and had also ridden this bike on different road condition.",Suzuki
If u want attractive look bike and you want it at cheap price than u can buy Suzuki gixxer sf.,Suzuki
If we are going to talk about suzuki company then it's a trustworthy and best two Wheeler company.,Suzuki
If we talk about Gixxer SF from Suzuki. It having good power and having better torque. This bike is also design on aerdynamic concept due to which it can achieve fastly to 0-100 is less time. Suzuki Gixxer SF have 150cx engine capacity with 14hp of power and 14 nm of torque. The same power and torque is the plus point of this bike because it can maintain its power and its pickup at this stage. Suzuki Gixxer SF directly give head to head compition to pulsar 150 and and cbr 150. So I can suggest tou to buy Suzuki Gixxer SF if you are lokking for bike with 150cc and and aerodynamic design. You can also take it off road without any hesitation.,Suzuki
If you are looking for a sport bike without hurting your pocket then Gixxer SF should be your first choice,Suzuki
"If you are looking for good looking bike with good average, gixxer will be the first choice. SF gives you the average around 40-45 kmpl that is pretty decent compared to a lot of other sport bikes. Talking about comfort, the seat is in one part compared to others which have 2 parts ( one for the driver 2nd for the person behind) . One part seat also gives more space for both the person seated. I travel miles with my friends and family. It's easy control and super grip tyres are so reliable. Best looking bike In the budget of 1 lakh. In my conclusion , this is the best bike by Suzuki so far.",Suzuki
If you are scarching a full fairing bikes under 1 lack.so this is the bike for you.,Suzuki
If you are selling some bike then you should know about the average of the bike in company showroon I am getting tgis type of issue then what about the outside.,Suzuki
"If you are tending to buy a fully fared bike by your own money then gixxer sf is the best and cheapest bike in India under fully faired section and 150cc engine. It has got 48km/l mileage and it weighs 139 kg. It has got 5 gears and air cooled cooling system. The suzuki gixxer sf has the max power of 14.60 bhp @ 8, 000rpm and it has got torque of 14nm @ 6, 000 rpm, it is available in 3 different variants and the paint work is done well. Coming to its comfort it's too comfortable when compared to the popular r15 and rc 200. I love the roar sound of the bike and is too smooth and comfortable, the fairing is not a marketing trick it is tunnel tested same as hayabusa, it is a good track focused bike and doesn't have any difference when compared to the naked gixxer other than the speed pickup is better in gixxer sf as it resists the wind and also is comfortable than the naked version .suzuki gixxer sf has become so popular because of its style and is the only bike which is fully faired in such cheap price. Now after all the positive points lets see what's negative, the bike looks too good but there's a gap near the engine, the mirrors may creat a problem in traffic, the suzuki company has done a great job but little more power to the bike is expected, the person sitting behind his legs touches the twin exhaust due to which it looses the color which might make it look little bad",Suzuki
If you like that review plz like and share and if u have any suggestion plz cmnt it below,Suzuki
If you took the test ride and loved it but you still can't fix it in your budget then you can opt for the normal version i.e. Suzuki Gixxer as I mentioned that technical specifications are same.,Suzuki
If you want a sporty look bike r15 and all but your budget is limited then go for this bike. Its a super Awesome bike.,Suzuki
In 150 cc segment bikes this Suzuki Gixxer sf is more preferable to buy it.,Suzuki
In 150 segments this bike mileage is quite impressive. On high ways you get minimum <50 Kmpl and in city 45-50.,Suzuki
"In all other section its good. Suzuki is doing a great work in recent years design wise,  the design of the bike is good and awesome look and the speed is also good but the power is not good and comfort is bad like I said in above comments only like this bike body only bad in power I do not like in this bike. there is good control design wise its an average dream bike of indian roads in this price range. When I saw its advertisement with Salman Khan I love its daficiency is also very good suzuki gixxer sf is available in three colours black, white and blue. Blue colour is the Moto gp edition. I want it in black colour with the suzuki logos like the blue one but that not available or create by the company. why I do not know. So I decided to but blue colour. Its also a good decision. My colleagues also like the design of this bike want to test ride of the same. hey also give a positive feedback and some colleagues feels very bad because they want to ride on this kind of bike but as they are over weighted they dont want to purchased it.The bike is really accept by the country and I think this the first ever great design launched by Suzuki in India. Now it have compete with other manufactures like yamaha, bjjaj etc. the display of this bike has special feature that it shows gear in which the bike presently so that you need to remember it. Suzuki company is one of the leading company but this product of Suzuki named gixxer is average.",Suzuki
In city its performence is good but highway you can only rev it to 127kmph. Its my top speed in this bike.engine is so realiable. Its does not heat after long streches.,Suzuki
"In design, telescopic front suspension and rear monoshock suspension provide a smooth ride over most surfaces, although we cannot really say about the ride over harsh road conditions without an extended ride. The power is linear and spread out well through the gears.so basically it feels you sporty.it is well-designed unit.black alloy wheels feature a pinstripe, which manages to add a bit of zing to the overall design. meterbox, indicators are beautifully designed.in power, engine hence is the same 155 cc single-cylinder carburetted unit, developing about 14.5 hp and 14 Nm of torque at 6, 000 rpm. engine features the Suzuki Eco Performance technology, riding dynamics front compared with the naked Gixxer. This means that the rider sits almost upright, which isn't the normal position one would expect on a motorcycle styled like this. That isn't a drawback though as the SF, due to this very reason, can be a great bike for covering long distances.so that was my driving experience.",Suzuki
In my point of view it is comfortable for young stars and also for middle age people,Suzuki
"In spite of using the same engine and five-speed gearbox, the gearshift on the Suzuki Gixxer SF felt surprisingly clunky. Specially, since I have been using the naked Gixxer for the last few months. So, just to double check, I took a different Suzuki Gixxer SF test bike for a short spin and realized that the problem was consistent. But the dealer says that this issue would get rectified after the first service.",Suzuki
In terms of comfort it might create an issue coz its back seat height is too high so it might create an issue for the guys with a pain in back problem,Suzuki
"In terms of design, the Gixxer SF looks impressive, but the build quality is questionable. The plastic used in the bodywork of the bike is of low quality and tends to rattle and vibrate at higher speeds, which can be quite annoying for riders.",Suzuki
In the beginning wherever I went people used to ask me about the bike and they were also amazed by the looks. Not only this even when I used to stop at the signals people used to ask me about it. Even sometime people stopped me and asked about it. And that was the best feeling to have when I passed and people use to stare at my bike.,Suzuki
In the end I would just say that this is a great bike and you should buy it if you are looking for a good looking bike.,Suzuki
"In the end I would like to suggest you. If you are planning to own a sports bike ( in budget) , go with this. It won't let you down.",Suzuki
"In the first impression, the bike looks stunning and superbly sporty. The full fairing design is aimed at providing maximum wind protection to the riders. Suzuki Gixxer SF specifications are similar to the Gixxer launched last year.",Suzuki
"In the year of 2015 in Indian market good looking, performance & good mileage 2 wheelers are few. I found suzuki gixxer & it was very new to indian market. I did many test drives compared with yamaha FZ version 2.0, finally I decided to by suzuki gixxer because good performance, good looking, good handling, very confident while cornering, brakes & I like digital speedometer & tachometer in device. Advantages: My bike runs 48 to 50km/liter which decent mileage, right handling, sporty sitting position, user friendly speedo display, good looking & value for money bike.",Suzuki
In this bike mileage is also very good looks like sports bike which is also plus point of that with great Reliabilty,Suzuki
In this bike mileage is perfect with a highly decor comfort level,Suzuki
"In this price range you will so many options like yamaha fz, pulsar 220 and many more but I choose this bike because of its look.",Suzuki
In this series.hornet is the best bike with good pick up and highest top speed.,Suzuki
In total the SF is great with price/look/ride. 100% best choice.,Suzuki
It can speed up 0-100 in just 20 sec if the rider is a ghost probbly one of the most powerful and fuel efficient bikes in india the lokks of the bike is breath taking and girls will fall in love with u because of your bike.,Suzuki
It comes with a 150cc engine which gives good performance at city and also at highways.,Suzuki
It delivers nice mileage of 40-50 within city and 50-60 on highways. It is such quality bike I have ever seen before.,Suzuki
"It delivers sufficient amount of power on both conditions.No complaints till now.Full efficiency is top notch.Design and Comfort is mind blowing.what else do you need.Only thing I found not so good is the service centers(not all the centers).But I found a good one in my town.So friends go for it Its a definite value of money, no matter if its city drive or touring Gixxer Sf is the most affordable, stylish, and well performing bike.",Suzuki
It found grip in sopping wet conditions and the engine does its job with great zeal and refinement. It is a hard motorcycle not to like.,Suzuki
It gives a approximate milege of 35 to 40 at citi road and about 45 km/l at highways.,Suzuki
It gives a mileage of about 42-48 kmpl. The best mileage figures in the segment would make it a highly affordable plus easy to maintain and drive.,Suzuki
"It has 3 ranges of color black, blue and white. But in blue it looks best. The cost of Gixxer sf with moto gp addition is 102000 INR. The sports bike lovers who want sports bikes but don't want to spend much should buy this bike.",Suzuki
It has a 155 cc single cylinder engine which is air coole system.,Suzuki
It has a good fuel efficient bike ever and it has a great comfort and have a nyc look and it give me a good chance for racing.,Suzuki
"It has a maximum horse power of 14.8 @8000rpm. and Max torque at 14Mm at 6000rpm. It has 5 gears shifts. It has front disk breaks and rear drum brakes which works fine. It has controlled speed limits thus doesn't make it a complete sports bike. Overall, it is a very good bike from Suzuki.",Suzuki
It has a sporty look and gives a feel that you are riding a high priced bike and it comes with motogp edition blue colour.,Suzuki
It has both rear and back disc brakes which are quite powerful and one can use it flawlessly.,Suzuki
"It has got a comfortable seat, in which two guys can sit easily.",Suzuki
It has its own style looking among its competitors and the engine exhaust tuned out being style plus to this bike.I had a opportunity to drive this bike from my friend it suits well drive during the national highway travel with good performance out put .But the seat comfortable was not good up to the expectation.It may be good bike among its competitors with stunning look and performance.The bike suits to youngsters who love ride sports bike with being for highway travels,Suzuki
"It has vary attractive looking .blue and black combination. it is well for sports, I have won a lot of race with SUZUKI GIxxER SF. it is vary comfortable, though it is a 4-cylender and air cooled bike.its pick-up is vary good. it is so nice looking when I went to buy bike, at the first time it brought my attention.",Suzuki

It is a nice bike first of all I am a bike lover always I am learning and searching for updated models of all company bikes now I am reviewing this bike coming to mileage it's very nice bike and now coming to its price was thinkable but it doesn't matter when you like it's painting because the engineer was worked very hard and it is the result of their hard work coming to design it was a sports moto go version model feel sportive coming to safety it's brakes was coming with single channel ABS brakes and it is also coming with fuel injection and that variant is known as gixxer Sf Fi abs.,Suzuki
It is a racing bike which is excellent and suitable for men. It has many gears around 6.i liked this bike so much.it also looks great. Specially its blue colour is my favourite.it is one of the most demanding bikes in the market. When it runs it makes very good sound.,Suzuki
"It is a super bike having awesome performance . its mileage is appreciatable, easy to ride, great power but a problem with the bike is that its difficult for a person aged above 50 to sit on the back. Style is very good. Moreover the suspension and the disc break is working fine.",Suzuki

"It is always ready for yor command and engine is very responsive.  I\'m getting milage of 43-45 kmpl, yes not high as reported by lots of users but quite good as of my driving style.

It looks superb, amazing and stylish",Suzuki
"It is not to much comfortable because of its fuel tank , u have to bend your backone to handle this",Suzuki

It has also not compromised with the safety of the driver. It has ABS for better control and mono hydrulic shock absorbers for better stibility in high speed.",Suzuki
It is pretty nice in look gives a appearance of sport bike in just 100500₹ ( on road) .,Suzuki

It is the best bike for the speed lover in 150cc segment.And actually I own one of it.,Suzuki
It is the best bike which I have ever seen.It has a very good pick up and we feel very comfortable while riding this bike.when we accelerate it it gives a very energitic sound.It gives a very good milage upto 40kmpl on an average.economically it is very reliant.,Suzuki
It is the best sportbike I have drive it on 120kmph and it is very food in handling and we can drive it very goodly the style and body finishing is also very good I have the bike from 6 months but there is not anything problem in the bike and the bike is comfortable to drive and the mileage is also very good and the prize is also less.,Suzuki
It is the cheapest fully fared motorcycle compared to the current racing champion yammahaR15.,Suzuki
It is the very super bike and its millage is very good it looks like a super bike it tire grip is beautyfull and seat confart is very good the petrol tank capicity is very large it last speed 170kphm It is the very super bike and its millage is very good it looks like a super bike it tire grip is beautyfull and seat confart is very good the petrol tank capicity is very large it last speed 170kphm,Suzuki
It is very comfortable in driving.its disk brakes are good enough like a racing bike.i love this bike when I was driving but one thing is not good is back side seat which have no support.,Suzuki
It is very fantastic bike . some specifications for suzuki gixxer SF.,Suzuki
It is very good loking and sportive.... and expecially the road grip is very good.....,Suzuki
It is very good looking bike and suites for rider / youngsters personally.,Suzuki
It just have a 154 cc engine which is not as powerful as other 150 cc engines of the R15 or the Bajaj pulsar. Pickup is too low! The bike is unreliable at all.,Suzuki
It look like 200cc motorcycle but it is 159cc which reduce the fule consumption result into greater milage. The unique thing is silencer which have 2 outlets .,Suzuki
It makes hand hurt after long distance but it can be fixed by putting some handel covers on it which is not a much problemes.its got seven step adjustable suspension but there is one problem that this kind of bike with such body frame it is for mature one or one who is drive bikes for at a year because once the bike fall by any chance it whole will be damaged for changing all new frame it will cost you .suzuki gixxer sf has same engine of gixxer 155cc single cylinder air cool motor which produce 14.8 ps of power. This bike suziki gixxer sf are used by many stunt schools in India for learning stunts on it and Suzuki gixxer sf is chosen by many indian track for teaching student for racing on track in proforsional track in India. Suzuki gixxer sf is very good bike for colloge student it should also bring anti lock breaking system in it because now are day it is very needed for better safety purpose and disk break at rear also for better break and road safety so that people who is riding this bike can feek safer and .it sgould also bring some good suspension on front rear is good with seven step adjustable but front one is bit not up to the mark. And Suzuki guxxer should also bring some 200 cc and above bike with good dynamic and lower price like it.suzuki,Suzuki
"It still has the single piece, all-black handle bar, though a clip on would have been more appropriate for the sportier Gixxer SF. You’ll also notice a new handlebar clamp which is said to be stiffer to aid steering, but the black colour of the bolts already seem to be wearing off.",Suzuki
It very nice in look and performence. It has a very good looking body kit. It is lowest version of GXSR1000.,Suzuki
"It was a very bad experience with my 3 months old gixxer sf that when I was cornering in my area unfortunately I had a very bad accident due to a stone which had made the tyre lost its grip at the speed of 90 due to which my bike skid and dashed a wall front of it due to which my bike front fairing was totally damaged and the petrol tank also got leaked . so , tgis is my personel review its not compulsory that you too may have accident but one think overall bikes with front fairing must be handeled carefully soecially on indian roads otherwise in case of performance and speed and millage this is a best bike to have in india as it has an amazing stylish feature like sporty look and digital speedo meter and disk brakes etc I prefer this bike but only for those who can handle with care",Suzuki
It was nice to look like a sports bike going around with us in our society.The worst thing that every boy gets away of buying this bike was it was a 4 gear system bike which is worst.,Suzuki
It will change your personallity.arround 50kmpl mileage. but the petrol tank is bigger so no to worry.,Suzuki
"It's  7 months of thrilling experience.This was more than expected. 8000 km down It feels like I brought it yesterday.It brings me excitement every time I ride it.It is my companion for every day ride to my office through rigorous traffic, weekends on highways.",Suzuki
It's a Very very bad bike. I telling you about It's part. It's part are very worth. Believe me I Have a suzuki gixxer sf.It's petrol drink capacity is very high.

It's a stunning bike which has similar Hayabusa . It is an purely middle class bike which satisfies the dream of buying a sports on a affordable price.The suzuki gixxer sf was well suits the taste of Indian customers especially to the guys who love to have sports bike on low budget with a stunning look and performance.,Suzuki
"It's a tough enemy for every 150 cc rival. Whether it’s Yamaha R15 or the Pulsar RS200, Suzuki has targeted every faired bike of each category. The resemblance of the SF to the track racers will push it to a new height. Other rivals of this bike are Hero Karizma ZMR and Honda CBR150R. Though none of these are direct rivals of Gixxer SF but still we can count all of them as a competition as these are fully-faired bikes and are priced below 1.25 lakhs(ex-showroom price).",Suzuki
It's awwwesomee. ???? really comfortable seat mileage is also good. looks dashing I have a suzuki gixxer sf. it's tyre's grip on road is amazing pretty much. smoothly feel when you are on road. the one thing I like most about suzuki gixxer sf is. it's fuel tank design fabulous. obviously go for it. thanks to SUZUKI ??,Suzuki

It's average fuel consumption is around 45km/ litre- that's awesome, Isn't? and coming to the looks of the bike, the look which suzuki has given to this bike like a sports bike which we can be seen in the racings and which all kinds of age groups love to see like! I bought this bike around 8months before. I enjoy my ride when ever I ride it!",Suzuki
It's tubeless tyres that are wrapped on black alloy wheel. The stopping power is provided to the bike by 260 mm disc brake. So its road grip are also very good.,Suzuki
Its a beautiful bike and the fuel consumption is also very less unlike any other bike.,Suzuki
"Its a nice bike for 110k, if you choose this bike there is no more regret. please be cautionary when tyres are wet or riding in a rain the tubeless tyres has very less grip and dont bend much, on small stones tyre looses control as back tyre is wide. the good things are more in the sf gixxer package, nice sporty look, attractive mask, initially pickup was great, tyre grip is too high and no fear of puncture as it got tubeless and wide tyre, you can bend the bike till you get scare tyre wont looses grip, decent mileage of 45 hmpl speed of 70-80 kmph and 30 kmpl 110+ speed. smooth gear shift, feels great the speed of 70-80, bike wont loose control and comfort after crossing 100+ speed also. bike engine sound is plus point, light is too wide and powerful, maintenance is not high, suzuki service is very nice as of now, mirror adjustment and look is nice, top speed in 128kmph. in total the sf is great with price, look and ride. 100% best choice.",Suzuki
"Its a nice bike for 110k. If you choose this bike there is no loss. Upto now I didnt ran out of milege.But after travelling 40kms the engine starts overheating.I bought this bike past year since I am getting mileage of 49.Its pick-up is nice, torque is also good and is comfordable.

Its been four months now that I've been using Suzuki Gixxer SF. I've clocked 7271 kms till now. No vibrations nothing. Just missing is the exhaust note. I ain't that impressed with it. Performance wise it goes well. Top speed I've with this machine is 132 km/hr with very little vibrations and no wind throw. In love with this bike.,Suzuki
"Its best vehicle for middle class person who wants mileage, sporty look, pickup, cool features etc. At cheap price but spare parts of this bike is weak but at the end it is a bestest bike ever from all the sports bike its also a good suspension jumpers, tires, headlights and the main thing weight is also a best.",Suzuki
"Its body is also very strong as compare to other bikes. Suzuki Gixxer SF has feel me to now I drive a bike which I needed.  It is easy available in the market. Also the beat part of thie bike is good price for this kind of bike. So I suggest you, if you want to good bike then go for it.",Suzuki
Its braking system is very good means front disc and rear disc is so good.Friends its front wheel made of 17inchs and its rear wheel made of 17inches.,Suzuki
Its design is inspired by the GSX-R1000 I am a mechanical enginner and by that why I tested this bike I am traning in suzuki motors that time the bike was launched so it is an awesome sports bike it has a great silencor like fz in that days many people modify thiers bike but when you buy suzuki gixxer sf you didnt want to modify it so it is 154 cc engine so it is also has a power.,Suzuki
"Its engine is quite throtty at higher RPMs, After 4000rpm it sounds like a mini beast tearing through air to go ahead.",Suzuki
Its has the looks moto gp edition with the good suspension.Really well in fuel its cooling system is also good.sf price is significant lower campare to others bike,Suzuki
Its main feature is that when we drive it with 100+ speed then the air which oppose its speed will not affect on it because of its shape.,Suzuki
"Its mileage is 45-50 in city and 50-55 on highways, which is almost good. it is petrol type and its capacity is 12ltrs, definitely not bad. whta all customers wants this specific.sure  this bike can compete for its capability with compare to other bike. even you are riding on roads filled with potholes, you would be able to handle the bike with ease. the bike might give impression that it is low on power(15bhp) when compared pulsar rs200, yamaha r15, honda cbr. you will realize that gixxer sf is little bit more powerful for a 155cc bike.comfort bye is gixxer sf does not vibrate even at top speed and its seat comfort is awesome, I challenged you won't feel pain.so my suggetion is you must have to ride once on gixxer sf, I challange you this bike will give more satisfaction.thanku",Suzuki
Its mileage is also quite good. I am getting about 45-50kmpl which I think is pretty good for a 150cc bike.,Suzuki
"Its most cheap and best bike than apache rtr 160 4V , yamaha fzs , pulsar 160 and this bike also has abs thank you suzuki for giving abs, it has very eye catching design and main is the speedometer full digital and and. Best , I love its tire and design like a racing it has led backlight and also 153cc powerful engine thats all thank you",Suzuki
Its seats are not so comfortable and ride quality is also not good and its cluch is bit hard to pull and it make pain in yours while riding and some switchs are out of reach and fells far from hand while riding.,Suzuki
Its very worst experience in driving d bike .i suggest every one do not buy the bike by seeing review n the look.i lossed my money n hope on the gixer sf bike on the 1st day itself.gixersf look is good but performance n pick up is worst .in one lakh price we have so many good bikes please go for that .after 2 weeks of enquiry I went for gixer but its too worst to use on daily basis.very much dissatisifed with the performance for any queries u can go for d test ride for atleast 2 to 4 kms .this is d my experience after riding the bike for 50kms on d first day. reviews are fgood on bike I dnt know how people loved d bike .,Suzuki
"It’s a practical design and hasn’t been designed just to grab eyeballs. So, if you look closely you'll notice that it's a two piece design which will be useful during servicing and, God forbid, if you have a crash you'll only need to replace the section that is damaged, than the entire fairing. Moreover, being designed in wind tunnel, the fairing is purposeful too - improving aerodynamic and downforce. What’s most impressive is that Suzuki has managed to keep the same ground clearance in the SF, as on the fairing-less Gixxer.",Suzuki
It’s awwwesomee.? really comfortable seat mileage is also good. looks dashing I have a suzuki gixxer sf. it’s tyre’s grip on road is amazing pretty much. smoothly feel when you are on road. the one thing I like most about suzuki gixxer sf is. it’s fuel tank design fabulous. obviously go for.,Suzuki

JUST BOUGHT GIXXER SF. AFTER RIDING IT FOR 3 DAYS WHAT I FEEL IS JUST TO SAY WOW! AWESOME. STYLISH IN BUILD DESIGN. NO COMPARISION WITH TVS APACHE 160 OR WITH HORNET. PICK UP IS GOOD. 155CC IS QUITE SUFFICIENT FOR CITY RIDING. MAX POWER 14BHP IS NOT TOO MUCH BUT I FEEL IT SUITABLE FOR ME. HANDLING PERFECT. COMES WITH MRF SOLID STICKY TUBELESS TYRES. BYBRE DISC BRAKE IS DOING ITS WORK IN PRETTY COOL WAY. SITTING POSTURE SUPERB NOT SO BENDING LIKE IN YAMAHA R15. MILEGE I GUESS TILL DATE I AM GETTING 45 ( COMPANY SAYING 50) THE EYE CATCHING FACT IS I BOUGHT THIS BIKE PAYING 1LAKH. ITS MORE AFFORDABLE 155CC BIKE IN TODAY'S 150CC PRICE SEGMENT. NO ABS BUT BREAKING IS SOLID BOSS. I WILL RECCOMEND OTHERS TO BUY THIS. IT'S GONNA NEVER HARASH YOU.,Suzuki
"Just so you know, the SF is the fully-faired version of the company's highly popular naked bike - the Gixxer. At this price, the Gixxer SF has become the country's most affordable fully-faired motorcycle.",Suzuki
"KTM DUKE390 and the RC390 being the class leader when it comes to sales, Suzuki might have to work on the pricing of the motorcycle and price it at a sweet spot. Also on the technical numbers and power figures GSX-R250 might have the same motor as the Inazuma, which was also a parallel twin 250cc motorcycle. Inazuma made about 25bhp and 24nm torque, but we can sure expect Suzuki to re-tune the motor to churn out power up to above 30 bhp and healthy torque to match the competition.",Suzuki
Key features 1) dual disk breaks. 2) led tail lights 3) awesome mass centralization 4) great cornering ability 5) meaty rear tires { 140/60R-17} 6) excellent high beam,Suzuki

LOOK'S- A look of gixxer sf is so bad it is a copy of gixxer the only change is front hood .And A hood of gixxer sf is create problem while we are cutting a bike to 360°.,Suzuki
"Lag in initial Pickup as well it doesn't have pulling power in 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th gear itself.",Suzuki
Last but not the least the Suzuki Gixxer naked model is also upgraded with rear disk brake.,Suzuki
"Last month I buy this bike I was thinking to buy this bkie when I looked it first time . if you want to buy bike my advice is to buy suzuki gixxer sf .i love this bike . it gives us a smart and handsome and good look person . it save our fuel as compared to other stylish bikes . it gives us comfort, it has amazing handling and control . the main thing is that the price of this bike is very reasonable .",Suzuki
"Last year GSX-R250 was spied in one of Suzuki’s plant, in Indonesia. The bike didn’t reveal much of its characteristics more than the designing elements being borrowed from the elder Gixxer. Aggressive riding stance, chiseled fuel tank and fairing, raised split seat for the pillion and IRC tires. These were a few observations on the spied GSX-R250 in Indonesia.",Suzuki
Last year I bought this bike.such a wonderful performance.i am not ride in this bike am just flying.sounds are too good. When I'm driving this bike feel like a bird.surely comfortable and handling is very easy. compare than another fancy bikes its a low cost and valuable one. literally countryside and heavy traffic places will take a ride 40km/lit mileage is confirm .such a good mileage.,Suzuki
Lastly I want to tell you that when I drive and use this bike so I dont find any disadvantages in this bike and I suggest you that when you intrested to buy this bike than you buy it this bike .,Suzuki
"Lastly, the bike does not need clip-on handlebar(like many wishes for) as it would defeat its touring capabilities. You definitely don’t want to sleep with a sore back, neck or shoulder after a day-long ride.",Suzuki
Late but  Suzuki arrived with an strong machine for the 150cc segments bike since 2009 in India.,Suzuki
"Lately, a computer generated image has been leaked on internet rendering the upcoming GSX-R250. The image reveals quite much about the character and the styling of the motorcycle more than what it does about its power plant.",Suzuki
"Like its naked sibling, the Gixxer SF is also equipped with an all-digital instrument console which consists of a speedometer, tachometer, odometer, trip meter and a digital fuel gauge. The bike is also equipped with a rpm display and a gear indicator, apart from these features, the instrument panel houses other tell-tales like turn signal lights, high beam indicator and neutral ligh",Suzuki
Like many other bikes I also boug this gixer some times earlier and drive it for sometimes.in starting stage the bike was going great and but after 2 months the perfomance and smoothnes of the bike gone.as it is luxry bike it is cost very high to the people but I dont think its worth to that.i like the look of the bike but I dont like the price and performance of the bike.the bike is good if we take it on the long driev also but it dont long last and not money worth.the brand name attach with the product is very good but in country like india it dont seem very effective.i dont like to buy this vehicle again.and the person who like light bike should not try this.,Suzuki
Liked thee bike the way it looked. Took a test ride was unhappy with its weird seating position The sibling was a great Power machine The AS200 but still felt on a losing side to the just launcched RS200.,Suzuki
"Loaded with exciting – equipment, power, handling and trusted Suzuki quality, the GIXXER is an invitation to ride",Suzuki
"Look is great the engine is the main parts of all bike the Engine type of Gixxer SF is 4-Stroke, 1-cylinder, Air-cooled and Displacement is 154.cm.",Suzuki
Look stylish feel comfart fuel compensation is 50 or 55 km it the shock . thankfully they have increase the space and increase the length pf jumps. Bike will be much comfortable now. I would love the engine side covers silencer and the rare jumps .Graceful bike but one majore problem in this bike that is problem bike frame is too low .in pakistan speed breaker is every street and everywhere .not suitable in this condition in pakistan company must have consantrat on this problem other wise the value of the bike is not that one.,Suzuki
Look wise nobody can beat the gixxer-sf.the bike got bst look in this class and with this range.,Suzuki
Looks are beautiful of the bike as new always because it is very important that features must be good than the looks of bike .so I like it very much after the looks are beautiful.,Suzuki
"Looks great, front is very stylish and aerodynamic, awsome engine sound, 40-42 mileage, gearbox is smooth, sometime it gives trouble to shifting 1st to neautral, engine becomes hot easily. Very easy to handle in traffic. Back seat is little high but for a rider its very comfortable. Its best in this price range. When it comes to the style suzuki gixxer sf is a clear winner. Suzuki gixxer sf is a no-nonsense commuter gifted with super sporty looks. It cant meet the power of yamaha r15 or honda cbr but it cant be counted out as well.",Suzuki
"Looks like Suzuki Motorcycle India have churned out another success story with the new Suzuki Gixxer SF. As the name suggests, the bike is based on the popular Gixxer and the ‘SF’ postfix stands for Sport Fairing – which has been developed in the same wind tunnel as the mighty Suzuki Hayabusa. And although the Gixxer SF uses the same headlight as its naked sibling, the fairing design and snout of this 155cc motorcycle has a striking resemblance with the ‘Busa, than the Suzuki GSX-R1000",Suzuki

"Mailage - 48 to 50 in public say other wise company demand ""60""",Suzuki
"Maintenance — Gixxer SF kills the myth that expensive bikes are difficult to maintain. I clean and lubricate the chain drive once a month from a Suzuki service centre that costs me Rs.120.00 — an easy on pocket amount. My suggestion is to go for regular chain drive cleaning and lubrication, adjust RPM idling periodically, maintain the recommended tyre pressure and the bike will behave exactly the way you would want.",Suzuki
"Manufacturers  have given nice sporty look. engine is 4 stroke engine with nice suspensions. with good sporty handling.this bike is available in five different interesting colours – Metallic Triton Blue, Candy Antares Red, Pearl Mirage White, Glass Sparkle Black & Metallic Oort Grey. fuel tank capacity is of 12 liters.with the weight of bike upto 135kg which is light in weight. nice comfortable seats .",Suzuki
"Many of my friends suggested other alternatives such as Yamaha R15, Honda CBR, Suzuki Gixxer(both naked and full faring versions) and likewise.",Suzuki
Milaege was good and look is awesome but the bike's reliability is not so good. I will rate this product with single star as its fuel consumption power is very bad.,Suzuki
Milage:- 65kmpl. This is what you get on the papers. But in reality you get On an average 58kmpl.,Suzuki
Milage:65kmpl.This is what you get on the papers. But in reality you get on,Suzuki
"Mileage - 50 kmpl, This is what you get on the papers. But in reality you get on average 40 kmpl.",Suzuki
"Mileage is average and the bike is very smooth even on the rough road. Tyres are tubeless. And bike comes with a disc brake on both sides rear and front. While riding bike handling is quite flexible doesn't take much energy to turn and catches perfect road grip while turning. More importantly, the bike has a digital meter and it shows time also no need for a watch. But comes with one drawback that it takes a lot of energy from your left leg to change the gear while riding.",Suzuki
"Mileage — Taking into consideration the fact that Gixxer SF is a performance bike in its segment and an excellent sports-tourer, it delivers an impressive mileage of 40–50 kmph within city and 50–60 on highways. Definitely not a bad figure to complement the bike’s 12 litre fuel tank. And yes, riding between 50–60 kmph and in fifth gear within the city will always deliver a satisfactory mileage.",Suzuki
Mileage- it is shown that it has 45KMPH but my Gixxer give around 50 to 55KMPH.,Suzuki
Mileage: It returns me a mileage of 55kmpl when riden under 60kmph. Above 60 Expect something around 40-45kmph.,Suzuki
"Mileage: The bike easily gives around 50 kmpl in normal city conditions, which is very descent for the 150CC bike.",Suzuki
"Mileage: The mileage figures are same with that of its sibling gixxer 155, because they share the same engine, frame, and basically all parts apart for the SF fairing.",Suzuki
Most important topic for many of readers. well this bike is equiped with SEP( suzuki Eco performance) technology but it has nothing special if bike is producing just 14 ps of power then it should give better economy then others. well it returned me 45km/litre on city riding and 50km/l on highway riding condition,Suzuki
"Most of the features are carried over from the naked version like the digital instrument cluster, clear lens indicator, chiselled fuel tank, LED tail lamps, tachometer, odometer, indicators, fuel gauge, clock, gear indicator, adjustable RPM indicator, windshield, three spoke alloy wheels etc.",Suzuki
"Most of the other features are from the Gixxer. The handle grips are nice and soft and the seat is well-stitched and comfortable. The body-coloured grab-rails flow well into the rear section with the immaculate design and are pretty useful for the pillion to hold on. So, even though the Gixxer SF is not a feature-rich motorcycle, the features are adequate enough and of top-notch quality.",Suzuki
My Previous bikes that I had wasn't good.hate Bajaj bikes from platina to pulsar 220 .Side Mirrors at perfect distance and height.Silencer is good.Just he back portion could have been improved,Suzuki
"My Verdict: If I had waited for a year from the launch of my Gixxer 155 I would have definitely bought it over my bike, but I have to settle with its sibling though I love this bike as much I love mine. I would surely recommend all to go ahead and buy it if your planning too.",Suzuki
"My advice is to buy this vechile. I am intrested in driving this bike . My friends are very amazed to see me on buying this bike after releasing this bike after 2 days.   Its 4 stroke 1 cylindered and an air coller.The air-cooled, single-cylinder 155cc engine is the same as the Gixxer too. The engine makes 14.6bhp and 14Nm of torque. But with the SF weighing just four kilos more than its street sport twin, performance too is similar to its naked sibling. Top speed is around 127kph.",Suzuki
My bike has gone through its scheduled second servicing and is getting better with every single day in terms of smoothness.,Suzuki

Next month I bought this bike I like so much in this suzuki company.,Suzuki

No doubt this is one of the best looking 150cc bike in the segment. the fairing added to this bike is so good looking that it may turn head anywhere you take this bike. Specially in the motogp edition this bike actually looks like it is ready for racing. And the fairing has been beautifully crafted over naked gixxer which adds just 4kg of weight. In fact the headlight is also the same.,Suzuki
Not bad the look is good and all the hanset of the bike is good but the issue of average.,Suzuki
Not only the bike but the helmet are also best they are coming in matching colours and graphics which gives the true feeling of racing bike.,Suzuki
"Not to say that there’s nothing new. The SF does get new clear lens indicators and new shape aluminium exhaust end cover. Like the exhaust tips, the heat plate on the side would have looked better if it had the same titanium-type finish, instead of chrome. Also, the key has the Suzuki logo in chrome to make it appear more premium",Suzuki
Not worth for buying. Everything in the gixxer sf is totally cheap. Yamaha R15 is best for the budget sport bikes when compare with the gixxer sf.,Suzuki
Now I took my decision and finally decided to have this Beast.,Suzuki
Now I want mention the first and most important thing that this product is only suitable for riders!,Suzuki
Now a days suzuki gixxer sf is the one of the best two wheelers .also the best part is it looks grand and looks sporty.it is a fully faired 155cc motorcycle which has been developed in the same wind-tunnel where the legendary Hayabusa.Mono Suspension gives you so so comfortable. it'll surely give a new meaning to your love for racing.it fual mileage is so good .,Suzuki
"Now come to comfort, the confort level is very good for single person but with dual its not cofortable as its performence goes down . The Gixxer SF comes with a 266 mm disc brake at the front and a drum brake.",Suzuki
Now let us talk about this bike this bike chassis are single downtube and front suspention,Suzuki
"Now lets come to the disadvantage of this bike, the main disadvantage which I really feel is that its road grip is not that much good. I really fall off this bikes many times because when I push the rear brake pedal, suddenly the bike got slipped and I have fallen.",Suzuki
"Now talking about the feel on this bike, the power is as low as compared to R15 from Yamaha& Bajaj Pulsar as150 but still it's having it's own benefit because of more refined engine than others, at the speed of even 60kmph, you will feel like you are SLIDING on BUTTER, sound is smoother than any pulsars and honda bikes whether Yamaha bikes are also providing silent sounds and boosted performance. Now suppose, you are riding with your GF, then its fine on bike like R15 Yamaha but if you are thinking that your MOTHER or SISTER or an old person is gonna sit on R15 or Honda CBR or KTM, oh man that's not gonna work{due to weird jumpy uncomfortable pillion(back rider) seat}; but on Gixxer sf, it's great yes its also jumpy but still comfortable, so boys think on it before purchasing a SPORTS bike that is from Honda or Yamaha or KTM.",Suzuki
Now the new gixxer sf fi ( 2016) comes in red colour also and the moto gp edition stickers are also updated.,Suzuki
"OK, I admit I am probably the polar opposite of a gearhead, whatever that is. But yesterday, I had an eleven-year-old grilling me about my bike, and I suddenly realized that I could probably compute this stuff if someone would translate it into non-gearhead language for me. I have the stats for my bike in front of me. What do they mean? I would really appreciate a translation that lies somewhere on the technical jargon continuum between 'it goes really fast when you turn the throttle' and what appears in these specs.",Suzuki
"Obviously I was looking for various bikes available in market. I started analysis, did some reasearch on bikes. So when I was on road I usually used to see Pulsar 220F in many numbers, it was hint that I liked Pulsar 220F.",Suzuki
"On road price in Rs.(subject to change): From 86, 668 to 1, 07, 105.",Suzuki
"On road price(subject to change), New Delhi(Rs.): 97, 046(Pearl mira red / Glass sparkle black, with rear disc brake), more",Suzuki
"On the paper, the bike seems weak but trust me when you swing your leg over it and twist the throttle it will throw you backward.",Suzuki
"On the whole, the Gixxer has remains an extremely comfortable bike, be it on long rides or even a short sprint. The suspension setup, great riding position and cushy seat make it a fun bike to ride in most occasions. In the last six months the bike has been aging well, which points squarely at its well thought engineering and design.",Suzuki
One may think that the extra faring is of no use rather than a show but it's not true. The fairing actually adds a lot more aerodynamics to the bike. While in a high way you can feel it by the way wind blast are reduced.,Suzuki
One of my frient buy this bike and its awsome to tide the bike.,Suzuki
"One of the best bike ever Suzuki gixxer SF. Top class performance, awesome suspension, cool handling, great pick up 155 cc engine, 50 to 55 km per litre mileage gives you value for money.",Suzuki
One of the best bike ever. suzuki gixxer sf. coolhanling great pickup and top class performance. and awesome suspension value for money best Japaneses technology. suzuki done a great job and make superb bike thanks for suzuki. style when it comes to style suzuki gixxer sf is a clear winner others may have a different viewpoint but no matter from witch angle you look at the bike it seems the machine is waiting to race. style looking great front is very styles. awesome engine sound. its mileage 38-40 kmpl. final word its the best price range. suzuki has compromised with engine. allover its a good bike.i love it.,Suzuki
"One of the best bike in class as compared to r15, fazer, fz, pulsar and more.",Suzuki
"One of the biggest issues with the Gixxer SF is its engine. The bike comes with a 155cc engine that produces 13.6bhp of power and 13.8Nm of torque, which is not sufficient for a sporty motorcycle. The bike struggles to reach high speeds, and the lack of power can be a major issue for riders looking for a thrilling riding experience.",Suzuki
"Other changes include the top triple clamp and the tip of the unique exhaust, both of which are unique to the SF.In that sense, you cannot take the fairing off and turn an SF into a Gixxer or vice-versa. Other changes include the top triple clamp and the tip of the unique exhaust, both of which are unique to the SF.I am intrested in driving this bike . My friends are very amazed to see me on buying this bike after releasing this bike after 20 days.",Suzuki
"Other than the front-fairing and the extra curb weight of about 4Kg, the Suzuki Gixxer SF looks exactly similar to its naked sibling. The key features on offer are - LED tail lamps, clear-lens indicators, digital instrument cluster, aerodynamic fairing. The bike has been made available in three colors - Black, Blue, and White.",Suzuki
"Our test bike came in the ‘Metallic Triton Blue’ colour scheme, which sports the attractive MotoGP inspired livery and matches the florescent green pin stripe on the alloy wheels. This is the best colour combination on offer as the other body colour options - Glass Sparkle Black and Pearl Mirage White, look rather bland without any livery.",Suzuki
Overall experience is good nothing to worry about. This bike is great for office workers and is preferable for one seater. The bike price is quite high but it is reliable.,Suzuki
"Overall, the Suzuki Gixxer SF is a bike with some impressive features, but the lack of power, uncomfortable riding position, poor suspension, and low-quality build make it a less desirable option for riders.",Suzuki
"Overall, the Suzuki Gixxer SF is an impressive package. It is based on the Gixxer, which is a fun product to begin with. What the SF gets over and above the Gixxer is the full fairing, which will be a hit with Indian buyers at its price point ?97, 532(on road, Mumbai). With an easy riding position, the SF will be a convenient bike for those moving around the city, as well as touring the countryside.",Suzuki

"Overall, this is a great package and also cheaper than the FZ, so it is a great value for money product.",Suzuki
"PERFORMANCE - A Bike gixxer is having a engine of 150 cc with 1 cylinder .Its acceleration is not good .And its mileage is 50kmpl as per company but in reality it only giving 40kmpl.I purchased it and not satisfied from its performance according to its price which is 90, 000.",Suzuki
PROS:THE BEST BIKE UNDER THIS PRICE BEST HANDLING FULLY AUTOMATIC WITH FULL GRIP ON ROAD HAVING TWO DISC FRONT AN THE REAR RIDER HAS A CONTROL DURING RIDE GOES 0-100 WITHIN20SEC IT HAS 155cc ENGINE WITH5 GEAR COMPATIBLE WITH MAX.POWER OF 8000RPM THIS MOTORCYCLE IS AVAILABLE IN MANY COLOUR ONE CAN THINK OF THIS BIKE WHO WISHES TO BUY WITHIN 87-90K IT HAS FULLY AUTOMATIC FRONT DISPLAY ITS HAS BS4 ENGINE SO IT MOSTLY ECO FRIENDLY IT IS VERY EFFICIENT AND BRAKES ARE JUST SUPERB,Suzuki
People will say this is new in market and all that but believe me it is very nice and reliable.,Suzuki
Performance wise there is nothing I need to say. It's a Suzuki engine that's reving inside this awesome looking bike.,Suzuki
"Performance: With the fairing added it gains around 2 kgs of weight roughly, but with the gearing, it gains little more torque figure's which boost the bhp up to 14.5 @ 4000-8500 rpm and has a torque that kicks in at 8000 rpm with a force of 14.7 NM.",Suzuki
Personal Advice- Don't go for red color- its too bright go for the black or blue model.,Suzuki
"Personally I have bought this bike and I would like to say that the pick-up of this bike is pretty awesome. My bike current average is around 45-50 its pretty good as it gives you power and average. It also have no vibrations although the bike has fairing. The only problem which I am facing is its mirror its too wide, a solution to this problem has been given within the handle of the bike, you can buy extra mirror and fix it to the handle like a naked gixxer. The Special edition is quite attractive due to its colour combinations. I feel very comfortable while driving and the bike is very reliable.",Suzuki
"Personally speaking, the features of the bike is quite good. The only issue is the service of the vehicle, which is for no reason too expensive on the official showroom. The gear box of the vehocle is also very cheap quailty",Suzuki
Petrol enginee and air cool this bike is velyebel price 145cc engien is good he is color very nice look bike seet is very comfartebal drive is vey smoodly and front and second wilee disbreck avelebal it's bike seet and stering very comfartebal he is control breck very good secsses this bike in two seet comfurtebl so very nice contro wonderres cantrol he look very good and very very nice look. USE AND ENJOIE THIS BICKE =,Suzuki
"Pick up is too good and no problem I have faced so far with the same. But just one small problem is that the height of the silencer pipe is little bit low for which sometime when I cross the big speed brakers, the silencer pipe is touching the road.",Suzuki
"Pillion rider really has a tough time trying to get comfortable on the small seat, especially if there is a heavy shoulder bag in the long trip, back pain is a sure thing after the ride.",Suzuki
"Pillion seat is not comfortable, family ladies are not allowed on gixxer",Suzuki
"Planning to buy this bike , then with no doubt u can give it a go.",Suzuki
"Positive sides, less vibration even if u are at 128kmph, thats the max speed it could go",Suzuki
"Power of racing means power of abs made the great shining of this bike which helps to run smooth with classically.It gives top personality by the help of their sporty look.This bike shows the power of suzuki autobiles.Digital metres, dual silencers, perfect mileages made their sharpness. When a person riding this bike, the tyres of this bike have consist common type of grips which helps to turn on their road.These awesome specification which makes differentiating from others.Love you 'SUZUKI'.",Suzuki
"Power — On paper, the bike might give an impression that it is low on power — 15 BHP — when compared to Pulsar AS200, RS200, Honda CBR, Yamaha R15 etc., but once you twist the throttle and the engine starts grunting, you will realize that Gixxer SF is pretty powerful for a 155 cc bike and is probably, one of the best bikes in the 150 cc segment, in terms of power.",Suzuki
"Powering the SF is the same 154.9 cc single cylinder motor as on its naked sibling. Though, the fairing adds an additional 4 kilos to the bike, it doesn’t hamper in the handling at all infact it provides more confidence because of better aerodynamic characters. Its motor generates 14.8 PS of power that is full thirteen percent higher than that of Yamaha Fazer, its biggest competitor. The gearbox is a bit notchy but still the SF feels very punchy in the city and can cruise very easily on the highway at a reasonable speed of around 80 k mph. Despite all this, the engine manages a fuel economy of little over 60 kmpl, certainly when the bike is ridden accordingly.",Suzuki
"Powering the Suzuki Gixxer SF is a 154.9cc, single-cylinder engine that churns out a maximum power output of 14.6bhp at 8, 000rpm while yielding 14Nm of peak torque at 6, 000rpm. The same engine also powers the naked Gixxer.",Suzuki
Pros- At this price tag its looks promising. Full fairing sporty looks.,Suzuki
"Pros: - The good things are more in the SF Gixxer package. Nice sporty look, Attractive Mask, Initially pickup was great, Tyre Grip is too high and no fear of puncture as it got tubeless and wide tyre, you can bend the bike till you get scare tyre wont looses grip ( except rain) , decent mileage of 45 hmpl @ speed of 70-80 kmph and 30kmpl @ 110+ speed. Smooth gear shift, feels great @ the speed of 70-80, Bike wont loose control and comfort after crossing 100+ speed also. Bike engine sound is plus point, Light is too wide and powerfull, maintenance is not high- suzuki service is very nice as of now, Mirror adjustment & look is nice, Top speed is 128kmph.",Suzuki
Pros: The design of this bike is awesome. The fuel economy it provides on Indian roads both inside city and highways is batter for the pocket. I get attracted to the front side and the exhaust pipes all the time. This two are the most attractive feature. The handling quality of the bike is also very good. The engine provides good power delivery and the overall experience is good. Cons: headlight high beam is not ok pls improve or upgrade,Suzuki
Pulsar AS series has been welcome in its competition and excel far better than any models.,Suzuki
Recently I bought the bike. I was amazed with the looks of the bike. Not only this the features are also best that one can get at this price. Its an extreme pleasure to ride this bike.,Suzuki

"Recently had the chance to ride a used Gixxer SF for a couple of days(model year 2015, carburetted, about 27000 kms on the odo).Yeah this bike sure is good.Even a lot of abuse from the owner(burnouts, triple digit speed attempts with three up-the works!) could not break its spirit or the 155 cc motor.The fuel efficiency has taken a beating though.In case of this particular bike it is about 45 kmpl, on the highwayriding solo, at steady speeds of 50-60 kmph.Can`t tell about new bikes.The owner has already eaten through the OE rear tyre(understandable!) and has fitted a 140/70-17 Modi Continental Conti-Go tyre in its place.Great control and poise.Very stable.And quite a looker I dare say!Really a nice",Suzuki
Reliability - The bike is not good if you drop it .Drop can damage you bike very badly .quality of plastic is not so good.,Suzuki

Reliability:- you get a 2 year guarantee and Warren tee for the bike.,Suzuki
Reliablity:you get 2 years guarantee ans warren tee for bike.,Suzuki
"Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality is awesome and handling is brilliant. For a bike, that weighs more than 300 pounds and carries me(almost 200 pounds), the handling is brilliant. It maintains a straight line, sticks to the ground and does not deviate. The wind blasts are taken care off by the fairing and windshield and you don't need to worry while riding in high speeds. Oh yes, if you duck down while riding post 90-100 kmph, your body would tackle the windblasts better.",Suzuki
"Ride Quality& Handlin Very easy to handle in traffic, back seat is little high but for rider its very comfortable.",Suzuki
Riding and handling is always superb. Good servicing from Suzuki Service centre.,Suzuki
Riding comfort: The bike height is suited even for an average height rider and the seat is super comfortable. Also the seat is continuous so is very comfortable for the pillion.,Suzuki
"Rivalling the likes of Honda CB Hornet 160R, Bajaj Pulsar 220 and Yamaha Fazer V2.0 FI, Gixxer SF is a lucrative option in the 150cc segment.",Suzuki
Road Grip - It has good road grip which gives it a great balance and also lowest turning radius.,Suzuki
Road Grip:- It has got good road grip which gives it a great balance and also lowest turning radius.,Suzuki

KEY SPECS:-",Suzuki
Scope is made up of plastic so drive carefully avoid rash driving.,Suzuki
Seat is so less comfy for long streches ( I did almora-delhi 400kms) .,Suzuki
Seating is not much comfortable you will feel tired very soon usually I can ride 250kms without any stop. But on this my longest ride is 134kms so I can say it is not that comfortable.,Suzuki
"Second is its service centers.  They are good in servicing work but not skilled if your bike got some problems they will not able to find it.  I have experienced it.  Once I have to take claim for body work due to a accident happen, suzuki persons says they had done wheel balancing but my handle was  tilted on right side.  They had done wheel balancing again but I got my bike with little tilted handle again. . So I again visited service centre this time they used hammer to make bike handle in correct position but results same they are not able to correct its  position. After more than 10 repeated visits to service center they able to identify the problem and they able to correct my bikes handles position.  But now it have another problem because they hadn't done wheel balancing earlier even on second time.",Suzuki
"Seems like Suzuki Gixxer SF is nothing but the bedecked sibling of Gixxer NS, with not even an inch of power bump. Same machine, with heavy armour, no doubt results in low mileage & shorter engine life. It's like you are roaming around on Gixxer only, but with a pillion all the time.Bad idea, isn't it?",Suzuki
Self start bike and comapny gives best display of speedomete and all that,Suzuki
Service at service station is not good(they are always ignoring and if you show them any problems then they said that its like this its not get fixed). Sometimes I tried to complaint but I am not because I dont want to harm there jobs.,Suzuki
Service center. Because My gixxer front disk brake touches in brake pad after half rotation. 2 service done in suzuki service center. I inform them that brake touches from first day of I purchase but after 3900 km problem still the same,Suzuki
"Service is needed for every 3weeks and its worse than any bikes( R15, CBR) .",Suzuki
Sf in suzuki gixer stands for sport fairing and FI stands for full enjection,Suzuki
Short distance means city 45-50 kmpl.but long distance is gives 50-55 kmpl.this bike millage very good.,Suzuki
"Since it has broad tyres the average comes out to be 35 in city and 40-42 on highways. Also, this bike is very reliable. It has very great appeal because it really looks like a baby HYabusa.",Suzuki
"Since the Goa ride which we mentioned in our previous long term post, the Gixxer was feeling gruff and had lost its spirited nature, but after getting serviced at the authorised company service station, which by the way is about 25km away, the bike did feel rejuvenated a bit.",Suzuki
"Sitting position , tyre , pillon , is almost same in all three bikes",Suzuki
"Sixxer sf is a stylish model introduced by suzuki bikes.After a backward time in the bike industry suzuki introduced gixxer.Gixxer is a stylish bike available in that price .Allso it attracted more youth as it is stylish. The mileage is different to different person.It depend upon the roads.But Allso people get around 50-55 km/liter. The bike is super smooth.I have really amazed with the comfortable of the bike.The engine was very smooth.Vibration is very low, as compare to other bikes in that range. Allso it is very comfortable in handeling the bike.As the company use the long handle it make super reliable. But the problem that I found was it is not compatable.The power delivery from engine is low as compare to other bikes( xterme, unicorn, pulsar 150) .And the other problem was it is not a bike for family use.The back seat is placed in a very height, like R15.So women in india cannot be travelled in GIXXER.Most of the ladies in india wear saree. So I not recomment gixxer for a family use. Apart from this it is a bike with great look and style.The design is extraordinary. Allso it have a big tyre which give great comfortable and grip.",Suzuki
"So I almost decided that I will have this bike only. The reason was obvious the looks, more power. But meanwhile when I asked some of my friends who were having Pulsar 220F they did complaint about the mileage, and condition of bike in 3-4 years down the line. They told the quality of the bike degraded over the years from date of purchase.",Suzuki
So I can't control myself after listening this. I went to nearest showroom and after having a test drive I decided to buy the bike. It is good and fuel efficient and reliable for personal use.overall the bike is good and fast.,Suzuki

"Style When it comes to style, Suzuki Gixxer SF is a clear winner. Others may have a different viewpoint but no matter from which angle you look at the bike, it seems the machine is waiting to race. I read a few reviews by experts and users where they said the bike looks smaller at times and the headlight design does not fit well to the overall built but I would differ with them. Yes, this bike grabs instant attention, from people of all age groups - male and female. In the midst of bumper to bumper traffic, Gixxer SF enjoys the attention from people driving Audis, BMWs and all high-end brands. They say Royal Enfield rides are arrogant but I noticed even them turning their head. You hit the road, park it somewhere or just cruise on the highway - Gixxer becomes the central point of attention immediately.",Suzuki
"Stylish and comfortable. It comes with varieties of colours such as black, white and the motogp special edition blue. Another feature that makes it different is that it has flexible indicators, tubeless tyres and gear indicator.",Suzuki
Such smooth comfortable ride gives a flying experience and we can rely in it for long distances. Look wise I will give full marks. 4 Months I got this bike and yet to point out any flaws.,Suzuki
Superb Bike. So Stylish. I Really Love The Bike. It Was A great bike for the reasonable price. Extremely good mileage compare to other heavy doom bikes. Defenetly you go for it. if You need a sports bike with a stylish look you go for it. black is more stylish more than blue bike. its look royal and very stylish. Another one good reason is It has very smooth control thats why I like the bike very much.,Suzuki
"Superb pikup bike and looking like a sports bike and its mailage also too good , that is good power and good style , gear shifting also good",Suzuki
Suspension Duties are handled by telescopic front forks and mono - shock unit at the Back .,Suzuki

"Suzuki is good to go for a long while in the wake of being quiet to go up against its adversary. The real buzz originated from bike, however the second enormous thought was the Gixxer which has quite recently unmistakably taken off like a rocket into space and now essentially commands the portion from'above'. Give it a chance to be deals or execution it wins hearts promptly. The reason? Indians need liveliness and common sense from their cruiser and Suzuki conveys this in spades since the very beginning. A bike that was difficult to blame with(putting our occupations in peril) as there isn't much to scrutinize. Be that as it may, now, it gets emanation neighborly and economy expanding fuel-infusion framework. The carburetor has been supplanted and frame shrewd there is another circle brake at the back. We invest some quality energy with the bicycle to give you a complete decision of the motorcycle.Design Styling astute it has been effective since the very first moment. In any case, a say required here is that each shading plan removes the dealership floors promptly as well. You can recognize the Moto GP version to the dark, red, white and different choices out and about by the crowds. The bike has the superbly cut side fairing boards alongside a smooth tank and moderate tail-piece with a huge clear lense tail-light which has LED in them just makes things quickly attractive.T he 2016 Suzuki Gixxer SF Fi here has new decals set all around which has an ""advanced"" impact to it indicating that there is ""electronic"" slyness occurring in the energizing framework. Red sewing on the seat is dependably an awesome expansion. The pinstripes on the wheels, the substantial double port fumes and the fat suspension units on the two closures ensures it is the perfect bundle for individuals who cherish riding and furthermore gazing at their cruiser once a day. Ergonomics The riding position is upright as the handlebars are raised. Notwithstanding, the seat is a little lower which at that point finishes the lively riding position without much complain. The handlebars tumble to your hand flawlessly and the seats are all around padded and an all around estimated to help expansive riders additionally feel great. As you can make out from the greater part of this, Suzuki proceeds with its custom of offering sitting ""in the bicycle"" and not on it. More goes ahead that viewpoint when you understand your knee's secure consummately on the tank the minute you begin inclining. Mirrors on our test bicycle weren't ""screwed"" legitimately. The ORVM's are likewise vast and can cause block in our tight movement conditions. We heard numerous clients say the same and now we think we have encountered different circumstances as well, when we tried the bicycle. A shorter, better outline one year from now could offer assistance. Generally, another region where the bikes inspires altogether. Speedo And Switches T operation indent quality, essential switchgear is available which has a motor off button, pass light and different alternatives ticked impeccably. Something that the opposition could gain from. Speedo since day is constantly featured by group Suzuki. We recollect Japanese architects saying that'Market requires more data from speedometers'. Suzuki has given the same here. Rigging shift pointer, RPM redline marker, Eco and Power mode, computerized tachometer and speedo, motor check light, singular turn markers, high shaft alongside nonpartisan obvious lights. A best speed recorder, two excursion meters, clock, fuel gage and an odometer finish the bundle and influences it to portion best too.Engine and GearboxPerformance is the place the Gixxer sparkles. Consummate measure of low and mid-extend torque alongside a solid and fragment best end control on account of astute adapting(not very short or not very long) is obviously a masterstroke overs its opponent which have both of the two things. What has changed and overwhelmed us is the motor NVH and smoothness. The 99.8% vibrations that were absent on the Gixxer, even that restricted has been raised. The motor is totally vibration free and even at redline there isn't humming that will influence your hands to go numb. The motor keeps on making 14.8 BHP of energy and 14 Nm of torque from the air-cooled 2-valve engine that we have seen some time recently. Fi has been utilized as a part of the correct course for most of the range. Smoothness of the motor influenced us to understand that have we picked the correct bike. Multi-barrel level of smoothness for a solitary chamber all through the rev extend just makes it engaging at this point. What has been lost is the bit of character and the soundtrack that the old bike had. The motor turns thrumy at the best end and the profound bass is practically gone. The motor is more resonating, free revving and there is no punch once you approach the 5000 RPM as you rev it ahead. Stellar execution proceeds as before on the grounds that the SF gloats of the most minimal kerb weight in its class. We accomplished a consolidate cycle of 48.3 km/l when tried on the interstate and in top movement. Expect comparable execution as before as well. Generally speaking, an exceptionally direct power-band and all around dispersed torque implies that extricating horses from this motor is presently more ""easy"" than some time recently. Elements Armed with the fragment, pundit and open top pick, single down tube outline and adaptive front forks which are bigger in breadth alongside a monoshock that is movable, it has the correct fixings to be a champ. How about we not overlook the fat tires by MRF that work in dry and wet circumstances alongside that, it gives great general life as well. Since they are outspread units, they convey more fuel-effectiveness also. As some time recently, the Gixxer SF remains a hoot to ride quick or moderate. The front-geometry which isn't excessively steep or too rake forward gives it a perfect adjust for moving in the city in tight spots as it the lower rake helps in the same.Meanwhile, the rake additionally gives great interstate levelheadedness and affirmation with regards to front-end input and strength. Ride quality notwithstanding being on the stiffer side keeps on being sufficiently consistent in the meantime for our broken streets to a degree. It isn't out and out cruel as more premium bicycles sitting in the classification above. The cruiser keeps on being light, deft and balanced in the meantime in the corners.The three words are once in a while synonymous and meet up with any bike with regards to clarifying elements. The solidness can divert you from a bit with regards to taking care of mid corner knocks, yet no where out and out cruel that it irritates the entire self-control. As you can figure at this point, it is agile in the city too while being fun when you take it to the closest corner cutting goal occasionally.Brakes, we weren't a devotee of the vibe since the start, yet there is a slight change, particularly at the front. In any case, the bike offers enough ceasing power since the very beginning. Raise brakes, which is another unit which has 220mm circle alongside single-pot NISSIN caliper likewise needs feel to a degree, however it is sufficiently effective at any speed to help put the stays down.Suzuki Gixxer SF Fi Review, VerdictThe Gixxer SF Fi is a major jump notwithstanding the way that item came before and this could be named as a minor refresh. The truth of the matter is, it is most certainly not. The Fi framework works ponders as it enhances NVH by an immense edge, the level of certainty increments while riding. The power and torque alongside very much tuned gearbox, makes it a perfect power-band that is another benchmark in this fragment. Offering execution and common sense has never been so very much adjusted. Suzuki is charging just Rs. 6, 000 over the carburetor. Nonetheless, the cost achieves Rs. 1 lakh in a few urban communities and at the cost there are other'capable alternatives'. Be that as it may, there are still things the opposition can't offer even today and Gixxer keeps on being a perfect passage level completely faired bike which has all the cases ticked for the buyer of this portion. Cost As Tested: Rs. 1.03 Lakhs On-street Delhi(Rear Disk - Fi)",Suzuki

"That will narrow your choice to one of the four basic types. If you're an avid cyclist, you may prefer a conventional road bike. Looking for a leisurely ride on flat, paved roads? A comfort bike may be more your speed. If rugged trails are in your sights, than a mountain bike might be best.",Suzuki
"The  engine of this bike with 155 cc  is powerful and punchy, though it's gear box is little bit hard, some times it gives trouble shifting to first gear from neutral but still it will be managed.

"The 155cc engine belts out a healthy dose of torque north of 3500rpm, and power is available all the way till 8500rpm when the rev limiter intervenes. We do wish the engine could have revved higher for more top end grunt, but then again, the Gixxer SF is not an outright track machine. The full fairing might suggest otherwise, but the SF is more set for touring than devouring a racetrack.",Suzuki

"The Gixxer SF carries forward the sculpted fuel tank and the rear panels from the naked motorcycle, though the edgy body panels in the front section have made way for the full-sized fairing. This fairing has been styled to resemble the bigger GSX-R superbikes and has been aerodynamically shaped to improve the motorcycle’s touring capabilities.",Suzuki

The engine is smooth and is substantial enough to propel it to 130kmph top speed.In terms of mileage, the Gixxer SF too offers very good fuel efficiency, with mileage in the range of 45-48kmpl uner normal riding conditions. Handling is brilliant and ride quality is quite sorted. So that makes the Gixxer SF not only an able commuter but a great occasional track tool as well as a touring machine.

Both offer refinement, comfort and good looks unmatched in their respective price range. Some might then want to settle for the Gixxer itself instead of paying about ten grand more for the Gixxer SF, right? May be!",Suzuki

"The Gixxer uses telescopic forks at the front, and a seven step adjustable rear mono shock suspension with aluminium swing-arm at the rear. These have been tuned according to the Indian riding conditions. The stability of the bike is taken care of by the suspension set-up which is soft and good enough for rough terrains. The wide tubeless tyres also add to the stability and offer a smooth ride. These MRFs stick to the road and inspire confidence to take corners, but a stiffer suspension could have meant taking the same corner with more conviction. The SF rides on MRF Revz(front 100/80-17, rear 140/60-17) tubeless tyres and derives its braking power from a single front disc brake and rear drum brake. This setup is not at all bad, in fact, the front disc brake provides great feedback, but a rear disc brake would have been an added advantage.",Suzuki
"The Kari Motor Speedway at Coimbatore is India’s smallest racetrack, the perfect location to hammer the Gixxer SF around to test its racing prowess. Tight chicanes, a long straight and a couple of tight corners make for an entertaining ride on the nimble, 155cc, 14.6bhp SF race bike",Suzuki

"The SF is based on the Gixxer. The front of the motorcycle is where the differences lie. The swept-back headlamp design is exactly the same as the Gixxer’s, while the full fairing apes the ones on Suzuki’s larger capacity GSX-R motorcycles. Air vents that sit on either side of the headlight are there for aesthetics rather than performance gains. Moving back, the rest of the design is just like the Gixxer’s, so you get the same muscular fuel tank, single-piece seat, a stubby rear with split grab handles and integrated LED tail-light.",Suzuki

The Gixxer SF, SF for Sport Fairing, is not much different from the naked Gixxer, except the addition of the fairing or the aluminium exhaust end cover, and also the clear lens indicators.

If you are moving with speed upto 75 its ferforms exceptionall well regardless of which rpm you are running at. But when u go above it u will feel vibrations and sometimes you will feel like its out of fuel or like its starving. Acceleration, its gonna thrill u better then fz, apache rtr 150, pulsar 150 or similar bikes. Maintanance, its the catogery, where it beats all, the maintainance is very lov, the fuel economy is very good, trust me u vill enjoy every single rupee of its fuel. The spare parts and the fairing are cheaper in comparision of othe faired bikes. Abot comfort, the rider seat is very comfortable but the pillion will give you pain in most of the cases. The rider's seat coushining is good whereas pillion is on the lower side. The comes the control, it have a very good riding position, when you wana duct it gives you that space and when you wanna cruise its gives you the upright sitting posture. Tyres a impressive. I spinned lot of bikes but non of them had this much stickey stock tyres. Intrument cluster is good, gear indicator and clock are good offering in the cluster.

The bike is very good suspension and a good front disk break.so controlling is very good.,Suzuki
The bike itelf is very good.Iposted the specifications because practical thing that is what people want first.Those who are planning fro a bike surely should go for this bike.No hinges no problem in comfort.It feels so smooth when you ride this bike.The design is great plus the color combination.Engine dispalcement(cc)is 154.9cc which is very good if 1 wants a good speed while riding a bike,Suzuki
"The bike looks great & handles well, but all positives are negated by the poor quality of metal used and poor servicing.",Suzuki
"The bike looks too nice and so attractive to viewers.It has a sporty look and a person while riding this bikes will look so stylish.It has a 12 liter fuel tank capacity.It has the features of led tail lamps, tachometer, gear indicator, clock and many more. I hope you like my review and thank you for reading.",Suzuki
"The bike provides you all of the comfort you want to and you can ride for long distance without any stop, or any problem.",Suzuki
The bike really looks awesome.the front of it attracts many heads.I personally went for it by the looks.in around 1lk this is a great option by suzuki.,Suzuki
The bike returns a very good mileage of above 40 kmpl in any condition. The bike is also a very good commuter and allows riding and overtaking in city traffic very easy. You can take it on the highway for a weekend ride now and then and the bike can hold it's ground.,Suzuki
The bike was launched in September 2014.It promises a distinct biking experience with its sharp torque and dynamic mid-range power that ensure better acceleration and sporty handling.,Suzuki
The body of this bike is strong.I have good reliability about this bike.We can drive easy because handling and control of SUZUKI GIXXER is cool.Colour of this bike is very attractive.I think that this bike model has more colour.,Suzuki
"The braking system is good, tyres grip is good.I think everything is good with suzuki gixxer sf??.",Suzuki
The brand is suzuki is exselant brand for anypri other brand.this look is nice and stylish. Dual silencer.engien is smooth and very good. Light condition varies nice.sit capacity is two people. The easy control handle. This bike is 153.4cc.1literpetrol= 50killomiter. 5th gear control.4second caount/65 run miter show. BBack tyre is fat and big. This engine is others country.engien sound is smooth.,Suzuki
The chassis of Gixxer SF is very good and confidence inspiring specially because more weight added to front due to fairing. Despite of having raised handle bar and commuter oriented foot pegs this bike can handle corners very well and leaning is very easy with fatty 140 section rear tyre. this bike is comfortable for long tours too the fairing on this bike provides very good wind protection and better aerodynamics means higher top-speed.,Suzuki
The chrome on exhaust was completely gone within months & the metal around the fuel tank lock was showing signs of rusting within a year. I mentioned it to the service technicians who said that the water drain out channels around the cap often gets blocked leading to rusting. Within 4 years the metal completely rusted thru forming a hole next to the fuel cap. I had to pay 6580 Rs for Tank replacement.,Suzuki
The color combinations look weird and I do not like any of the color combinations. Suzuki has tried to introduce a great sporty bike for India but I think they have failed in doing so. Riding quality of the bike is well and good but it could have been much sporty if it would have been a little longer in length.,Suzuki
"The commutating distance is basically 60km/day ( 30km one side) .5, 6 days a week. well TBH I love the bike I dont have experiance riding other bikes other than my dads bullet which is 25 years old.",Suzuki
The company Suzuki have made more attractive vehicles such as cars and bikes.,Suzuki
The company has priced the bike perfectly. Though the bike has no direct competition because it is the only fully-faired bike in this price range in India.,Suzuki
"The company is promoting it as'The Street Sport Bike', which is a one of a kind in that price bracket. We set astride the motorcycle to find out if the SF is Salman Khan in a tuxedo or it has even more substance to offer.",Suzuki
"The comparison of this bike should be done with Yamaha fz, Yamaha faizer, Honda hornet, bajaj avenger.",Suzuki
"The creation of the new Gixxer SF is surely a turning point of Suzuki's share in the Indian motorcycle market and with the Special MotoGP edition, the rise would be rebellious. Suzuki's new Gixxer SF defines the real meaning of affordable sport biking, letting every bike maker move ahead with their hefty price tags, beating them again with its outstanding performance.",Suzuki
The design of this bike is relay awesome good bike in average good look good speed but power is not good and comfert is bad it only like this bike body only bad in power I dont like this this bike is only ok not good control is good and good look also this is not to good some feature are not there suzuki gixxer sf is my dream bike when I saw its advertisement in elision with salman khan I love it s deficiency is also very good suzuki gixxer is avealible  in many different colores in the markerr its mileage and liiks are awesome it is very comfoert in any kined of rod,Suzuki
The display is fully digital also indicate the gear which help new rider or learner to ride bike smoothly.,Suzuki
"The dream of every rider is to drive suzuki gixxer sf which is available in market at a least price. Its a full faired 155cc motorcycle having similar looks of legendary Hayabusa manufactured by Suzuki. The performance of this bike is outstanding and the mileage is around 45+ . The top speed of this bike is 131kmph, you just need to twist the throttle and make the traffic dissappear from your rear view mirrors. This bike is available in 3 colours, among this blue colour i.e motogp edition attracts most of the viewers. Happy riding:)",Suzuki
The engine and gearbox variants are similar to the old Gixxer. Sosc 154.9 cc single-cylinder engine is also the power of 14.6 Bhp with a torque of 14 Newton meters generates. These 5-speed manual gearbox is engaged.,Suzuki
The engine is of  155 cc with stunning body design and with front disc brakes digital meter with a front mask.It also comes without a mask and its cost without a mask is 80000 INR.,Suzuki
"The engine makes 14.6bhp and 14Nm of torque. But with the SF weighing just four kilos more than its street sport twin, performance too is similar to its naked sibling. Top speed is around 127kph.  The riding position of the SF is similar to the Gixxer’s with the flat handlebar and the slightly rear-set foot pegs that give the motorcycle its sporty feel. The 155cc engine belts out a healthy dose of torque north of 3500rpm, and power is available all the way till 8500rpm when the rev limiter intervenes.",Suzuki
The engine of this bike does not get overheated so this bike is nice for longdrive.The colour given to this bike are mind blowing and the maintenance of this bike is very low.The gear system is also nice.,Suzuki
"The engine performance is almost similar to the naked version. The mill revs smoothly from idling to up to 9, 500rpm without skipping a beat. There is ample amount of low- and mid-range of power to ride the motorcycle at low speeds and cruise comfortably at 100kmph respectively. Indicated speeds of more than 130kmph are possible but 80-90kmph is where the rider is going to be very comfortable.",Suzuki
The engine remains the same 154.9 cc unit producing 14.6 BHP and 14 NM of torque. The braking and suspension part remains also the same as the base version. The really impressive work done by Suzuki will pay back soon and the rivals would have a really tough time being with such a competBrianbalakumaranr. The view for the company in the consumer's mind can be changed by the Gixxer SF and the love for the MotoGP edition would rise at least once in every fan.,Suzuki
The engine which delivers 14.6bhp and 14Nm of torque through a five-speed transmission!the ride quality of the bike is good but touching the reve limt will certainly u can feel the vibration! the handling of the bike is good too!when it comes fuel efficiency u guys all know its 150cc bike and it delivers 50-55kmpl! now at this price u want fully fared bike u can certainly go with gixxer sf but certain look at the tvs apache rtr 2004v which is 200cc bike which is avaiable for 1lakh which offers some amazing performance!,Suzuki
The extremely-delicate lbs and punchy motor underneath the fashionable fairing from the Gixxer SF is pushed with innovative SEP technology which permits the Gixxer SF to provide fantastic electric power with no compromising gasoline economic technique.,Suzuki
"The following message, posted on a motorcycle forum that I used to run, was the motivation for me to provide these definitions of terms used in motorcycle specifications.",Suzuki
The following provides definitions of terms to demystify motorcycle specifications as usually listed in the motorcycle magazines and on Internet Web sites. These definitions of terms should be easier to understand by riders who would rather ride than learn the technical complexities of their machines. Bear in mind that whole books could be written about each term. We are only touching the basics.,Suzuki
"The fresh Gixxer SF is mentioned here to set up your pulse all all over again. With its even more characteristics, It will Certainly give a new desiring to your like for racing. Hardly ever to ignore, this amazing performer arises from the Gixxer Partner and kids which delivers of profitable numerous awards. So why keep out, the streets await you.",Suzuki
The front disc brake is progressive and is very unlikely to make you lose control even during panic or sudden braking. The rear brake needs some adjustments by the mechanic. A rear-disc brake would have been highly appreciated.,Suzuki
"The front is fully-faired to look as sporty as possible, but you do not get clip-on handles or rearsets. The tail section is similar to that of Naked Gixxer with step up seat, exhaust muffler with an aluminium cover, LED tail light and split grab rails. Even the instrument console is carried over from Naked Gixxer together with all essentials. There is also a MotoGP edition Gixxer SF available with Suzuki Racing Blue livery.",Suzuki
"The front mirrors on this bike are like horns that gives an aggressive looks to it. somehow when the mirrors are closed they look MORE attractive. I am having the version with both front and rear disc installed(for better riding protection). The silencer(exhaust) on this bike is really a fantastic one(its actually a dual silencer) promising great sound and performance. Now talking about the tyres, the front tyre is 100mm wide& rear one is 140mm which is as wide as Yamaha FZ and Fazer. The great thing you will like in this is, as compared to Yamaha R15& Honda CBR, the rear mudguard is so attractive and rigid so that it give a real sport feel with the wide tyre below it, one more option is that Suzuki provided a way to remove the Rear mudguard so that it gives even more fantastic look that is demanded by schoolboys and fukreys(funky) boys;).",Suzuki
"The front of the motorcycle is where the differences lie. The swept-back headlamp design is exactly the same as the Gixxer’s, while the full fairing apes the ones on Suzuki’s larger capacity GSX-R motorcycles. Air vents that sit on either side of the headlight are there for aesthetics rather than performance gains. Moving back, the rest of the design is just like the Gixxer’s, so you get the same muscular fuel tank, single-piece seat, a stubby rear with split grab handles and integrated LED tail-light.",Suzuki
The fuel consumption of gixxer sf is amazing it gives 45km/litre.,Suzuki
The fuel efficiency of the bike is 35 kilometre per litre which is very efficent  because of the cubic capacity of the engine.,Suzuki
The full faring model of gixxer is the only one which is under 1L price. It is best for normal use basically for college students. I am using it from 1year so what I found is;,Suzuki
"The fully-faired version of the popular 150cc bike Suzuki Gixxer is quite popular in its segment. Styled in tandem with the regular version, the additional fairing further accentuates the sporty flair lending a muscular look to the bike. Powering the fully faired Gixxer is the same 155cc engine that does duty on the standard version.",Suzuki
"The gear shifting was incredibly messy before the first servicing. Even after getting the servicing done, gear shifting has not become that smoother. But don't lose heart, it is very muchmanagable. While it's not butter smooth, it won't leave you stuck also.",Suzuki
The gisser sf 155cc bike is reaaly quite awesome for its look but not its power. people think that it will be a 250cc bike but it is not. The sound of firing is quite ugly. In sporty colour it seen awesome.The sitting arrangment of back seat is not really goog. the bike is not good for long root. overall performance is very good. And fuel efficient.,Suzuki
"The gixxer sf is an good motorcycle .the the sf corners like gixxer .the ride is little stiff but the suspension is adjustable with different settins.suzuki gixxer sf is an impressive package.It is based on gixxer which is a fun product at begin with at price 84, 439 to 95, 233 INR its an impressive package with the impressive mileage of 40-45kmpl",Suzuki
"The ground clearance is good considering the Gixxer SF is a fully-faired bike with its low slung belly pan. The bike never scraped on speed bumps or rough patches while riding solo, but one will have to be a little careful when with a pillion. The debatable stock set-up is good enough for Indian riding conditions as the bike handles perfectly well on paved as well as undulated roads",Suzuki
The handling and controls are very good it is very smooth on road and it heandles a deep turn the controls are just amazing the spedometer is full digital and very easy to read the date and time on the board.,Suzuki
The handling of the bike is very smooth it gives me smooth riding smooth gear shifting smooth accelerator the noise of engine is also very smooth.,Suzuki
"The headlight, mirrors, turn indicators and the rear number plate assemble have been chucked.",Suzuki
"The high-quality on the lookout Suzuki Gixxer SF is a fully faired 155cc bicycle that has been designed in the very same wind-tunnel the location the legendary Hayabusa, GSX-R and MotoGP devices are designed. The fairing has grown to be created to present best wind defense to your rider, reducing turbulence and drag, therefore providing marvelous aerodynamic performance.",Suzuki
"The important factor is that its fairing is not only for showcase, is been areodynamically laid-out and wind tunnel tested for the super performance from superbike in its segment.",Suzuki
"The look is very attractive due to the head light, tail light, design, handle, suspension, seating arrengement etc. Girls always attracted towards this bike due to the attractive look, wonderful firing of silensor, and the arrengement for seating. Thank you",Suzuki
The look which is most important for buyers my bike is gixxer sf black the black is best of all time I prefer black personally,Suzuki
The looking of Suzuki Gixxer SF is fully faired 155cc motorcycle,Suzuki
The looking of the Bike is awesome ?? and the features are also very good.,Suzuki

"The looks of the bike is fabulous , it is a complete sports cruiser. The power response is crispy. The bike has good leaning anglea. I own this bike and the mileage I get is 35 , although I am not a smooth gear shifter.",Suzuki
The looks of this bike are just great. Whenever I take this bike on road everyone just keeps staring the bike. It looks like a much higher capacity bike. Even in my college it is an eye candy. The bike has a great cosmetic job. The exhaust on this bike is just great. That grunt it makes is a treat to hear.,Suzuki
The looks: The full-fared body of the bike is astonishing and the graphics are too good.,Suzuki
The meter comes equiped with shift light which means it will tell you when to shift the gears.,Suzuki
The milage of this bike is 40 to 45.which is till low to othe bikes.,Suzuki
"The most awaited bike of Suzuki in the 150 cc field. This bike has created sensation . I personally own this bike and is very happy with the experience it gives. According to me it is the best 150cc bike in the market at the moment. It's handling, short pickup and mileage is according to what it has promised. It gives a mileage of 45kmpl. With a very pocket friendly price of 1.05 lacs is the best in the market",Suzuki
"The most awaited machine from suzuki india. Its fast, musculer, balanced, fuel efficient. Its a normal commuter with added full fairing. But looks like a super sports bike.",Suzuki
The most importent and attertacive thing of this bike is it's cood and sexy sporty look and it's low prize.,Suzuki
"The motor is paired to a 5-speed gearbox.Clear lens LED tail lamp. The suspension setup on the Gixxer twins includes telescopic forks at the front and a mono-shock setup at the rear, while braking performance comes from twin disc brake setup, with the rear drum brake available as optional.",Suzuki
The new 149.5cc Suzuki Gixxer SF sports bike comes with the 4-stroke air-cooled single-cylinder engine tuned to produce 14.6bhp at 8000rpm and 14Nm of torque at 6000rpm at 47kmpl.

The new Gixxer SF with the same engine and some increased fairing weight is expected to return around 42-48 kmpl. The best mileage figures in the segment would make it a highly affordable plus easy to maintain and drive.,Suzuki
"The new Suzuki Gixxer Sf a premium bike and it is here in Indian Markets is setting the pulse again. With additional features it'll surely give you a new meaning for your love towards Racing. My Brother bought new Gixxer SF recently and believe me it gives you the true feel of What a Race is(as according to the Indian Roads). This bike have ABS, 5 speed gear box 7 adjustable Mono Shock, engine with 14.8ps @ 8000 RPM and many more things and most important thing it have great mileage under this segment I found it's Mileage 56kmpl. You can make a test drive. But I'll suggest first drive other comparative bikes and at last Drive Suzuki Gixxer SF & I think you must get the difference and must fall in love with it like me.;-)",Suzuki
"The new gray colur is awesome and , while driving its having a good smoothness and good efficent its good looking for all peopels and its hardly given above 55 kilometers per hour , we can traval without they warry of fuel and athor one of the good and advantage of this is its looking azaming like a sports bike and its handle also stright line its so comfort and engine also too good becuse it was made by suzuki that famous company and compare with other bikes it's price also best .",Suzuki
The new stylish Suzuki Gixxer SF has been relaunched in 2017 and comes with a great graphics and it looks much more attractive than earlier.It is a 155 cc bike. Suzuki bikes are well known for its comfort and its build quality. The mileage of this bike is about 40-45 kmpl on city roads and it gives above 50 kmpl on highways. The handling of this bike is so good that it offers so much confidence while driving. Besides this this bike comes with a super sticky MRF tyres so that it can provide proper grip to the road . For this reason doing cornering with this bike is quite easier. This bike is also used in the tracks. Above all these this bike costs under a lack and so it is the best bike among all 150 cc bikes.,Suzuki
The newly dressed Gixxer SF and naked Gixxer 155 share the same muscle under the shirt. The 154.9 cc single cylinder air cooled mill churns out 14.6 Bhp @ 8000 rpm with a torque value of 14 Nm @ 6000 rpm. The engine is mated to a 5 speed manual gearbox. The performance stats are much better than its segment rivals and chasing the higher one is what the motorcycle is made for.,Suzuki
The newly launched Suzuki Gixxer is gaining a lot of popularity among everyone but I found out that the bike is not that worthy as it looks.! I took a test drive of the Gixxer SF and came out with some outcomes which I am going to share in this detailed review!,Suzuki
"The next to touch is the dual tone exhaust. Man. the sound it produces is enticing and pushes you to do more than just driving. And the best part is mileage. I drive it in a metro @ an avg of 5500-6500 rpm and the mileage that it offers is around 48-51 kmpl. The downside of the vehicle is plastic controls(it does the job really well, could have been back-lit and crispier than it is) and no clip on handle bars. Still you can get it altered in a local motor garage.",Suzuki
"The only difference between the regular version and SF variant is the full fairing while it borrows key styling features such as LED tail lamps, digital instrument cluster, clear lens indicator etc from its naked sibling. Available in three colour schemes, SF has inherited the chiselled fuel tank from its naked sibling. The oval-shaped dual exhaust and the Y shaped-three spoke alloy rims have also been carried over from the regular Gixxer.",Suzuki
The only down side of this bike is the lack of the sixth gear. The previous bike of suzuki the GS150R was the first bike in 150cc that comes with the sixth gear. If it was present in the gixxer series then it would be the market leader of indian two wheeler segment. No need to worry it is the buyers choice.,Suzuki
The only drawback is that the bike is a bit costly considering the engine capacity which is only 150CC. But the full fared body justifies the price completely.,Suzuki
The only problem this bike has is pillion comfort.it is not suitable for pillion.,Suzuki
"The only thing which I didn't like is the pillion seat, as sometimes people feel little uncomfortable. But I think Suzuki could have made sized it large maintaining all existing aspects of bike. However that is not the deal breaker. you get a lot in this bike.",Suzuki
"The performance of this bike is also good which is most important thing to all riders, it's very comfortable for long drive.",Suzuki
The performance stats are much better than its rivals. The wide tyre setup at the front and much wider at the rear provides a tension free ride all the time.,Suzuki
The pickup and suspension of the Suzuki Gixxer is vey good and it do not make extra sound.,Suzuki

The rate with which plays a vital role in buying bike the cost quit good and worth for money.,Suzuki
"The rear seat gets a cowl to make the bike look sporty while the Suzuki racing blue colour has been carried forward but the fairing has been filled with sponsor decals to give it that quintessential race bike look. The Suzuki Gixxer SF, in my opinion, is among the best 150cc motorcycles on sale in India and in its track-spec avatar the desirability factor goes a few notches higher.",Suzuki
The reliability in gixer sf is also great and it moves out smoothly,Suzuki
"The reliability, longevity, permanence and durability of this product is marvellous and this bike gives a good millaege along with better fuel consumption.",Suzuki
"The ride is nice everything is good handling, riding position, tyres width, big disc everything but again the gear box is not up to the mark as per the claims made by Suzuki.",Suzuki
"The riding position of the SF is similar to the Gixxer’s with the flat handlebar and the slightly rear-set foot pegs that give the motorcycle its sporty feel. The 155cc engine belts out a healthy dose of torque north of 3500rpm, and power is available all the way till 8500rpm when the rev limiter intervenes. We do wish the engine could have revved higher for more top end grunt, but then again, the Gixxer SF is not an outright track machine. The full fairing might suggest otherwise, but the SF is more set for touring than devouring a racetrack.",Suzuki

"The suspension of the bike is another issue. The bike is equipped with a telescopic fork at the front and a monoshock at the rear, which fails to provide adequate damping. This can result in a bumpy and uncomfortable ride, especially on rough roads.",Suzuki
"The suspension of this bike is best in class, you would not get the better suspension in the segment. It absorbs all the bump and sorter hall on the road. yet the mileage of this bike is 55 kmpl which is more than anyone in the segment. Thanks for the great suspension and nice sitting position you feel like home every time you sit on this bike. You find great sport bike at low prize.",Suzuki

"The vehicle looks very good but at the same time it is very powerful as well, The mileage is one of the best in segment where company claims a mileage of 63 KMPL. But it gives a mileage of 50 in the city and 55 on the highways. It has a 12 liter fuel tank which is capable of store enough petrol which can carry the vehicle up to 600 Kilometers easily without getting worried about the refueling again.",Suzuki
"The weight does not look to be more, but it weighs about equal to KTM DUKE 200 with about 139 kgs.It is assual like electric start which is common for bikes now a days.",Suzuki
The wide tyre setup of 100/80-R17 at the front and much wider 140/60-R17 at the rear provides a tension free rideallthe time.,Suzuki
Then new model comes with a fuel injection engine and now also with a rear disk brake.And suzuki claims that the power of the bike is increased then the earlier gixxer sf.And guy main thing is the colour of the bike.,Suzuki
There are a few things I don't like. Like the mirrors are very wide which makes navigating through the traffic difficult. The right one gets loose with time. The rear foot peg is just over the dual exhaust and when a pillion rides his foot scratches the exhaust.,Suzuki
"There are many reviews on how peppy, sporty it is. Therefore am not santoshkr80 blow the same trumpet.",Suzuki
There are now companies providing well designed bikes among them suzuki is my favourite bike brand and its provides well bikes for youth and I have purchased suzuki gixxer last year and I love the bike very much its design is so comfotable for me. as suzuki was was best in four wheel it now provides best two wheeler bikes also for a great price. I hve purchase suzuki gixxer for 84000 ruppes at my local showroom and its a impressive design below 1 lakh ruppes in india . well comes to engine suzuki gixxer is 155 cc single cylinder air cooled mill churns out 14.6 bhp@8000rpm with a torque pf 14Nm @6000 rpm and the engine is mated toa 5 spped manual gearbox and its performance is so good than other bikes which I have rided and well comes to brakes it comes with a 266 mm disc brake at this price and its so comfortable for long ride also.,Suzuki

"There is nothing amiss and the designers have taken care of even smaller details like the kick-lever accentuating the design, and the fluorescent lines on the fairing, tank and alloys are in sync. Be it the headlamp or the fairing, the tank or the seat, the rear section or the tyres, Suzuki has styled the motorcycle in a way that it is at present unparalleled in its class. In fact, if we were to look at the fully-faired motorcycles in the 150cc segment across various price ranges like the Yamaha R15, Fazer and Honda CBR150R, the Gixxer SF is still the clear winner.",Suzuki
There is nothing that I feel that Is not good in this bike according to me.,Suzuki

"This bike is an over rated bike. The price is too high as compared to its performance. I bought this bike last year in October and it did not meet my expectation. I have to shell out almost 100 thousand bucks to buy it and then it just disappointed me. The head light do not suits the bike body style at all. Suzuki had retained the headlight from it's naked bike but I think it looks too narrow as compared to the bike's body. The digital meter appears to be a dauntingly crammed full of stuff. It takes a lot of time to adjust to this meter. The entire upper panel of SF sits on a ocean of plastic frames, which I think could have been exchanged with a better solution. All the bike within the category of 150 cc - 155 cc should at least have a mileage of 45 Kms/litre. But this bike fives me only 35 Kms/litre and also 30 Kms/litre in the city. Also I have discovered lagging issues while in upper gears. It also requires a fortnightly servicing as compared to the other bikes like R15 etc in its category. I will personally not recommend this bike due to a number of shortcomings at this price range.",Suzuki

"This bike is good looking and very stylish, Gixxer SF is one of the best bikes I have come across Handling Handling of the bike is top notch really comfortable seat mileage is also good. looks dashing I have a suzuki gixxer sf. it’s tyre’s grip on road is amazing pretty much I am very satisfied with this mottor bike, You won’t find any other bike more beautiful than this suzuki gixxer sf( specialy the blue one) at this price range so friend's buy now this bike and ride of you.",Suzuki
"This bike is just a really wnna be bike. I guess suzuki just made it out of desperation to compete in the market with bikes like yamaha's fz, r15, tvs's apache but hasn't really did the job well. its got an OKish mileage of 35-38 on road but it still couldn't beat yamaha's fz which is better in not only mileage but also looks better and is a lot more comfortable. its got fine road grip, handling could have been much better and is even better than tvs's apache but is still nothing comared to the fz. overall its a fine product if you looking for a cheaper looking FZ.",Suzuki
This bike is just like a smoothness in walking.just like a smooth air bubble in the sky is moving and handling control is superb This shows the attitude of having kust like a big bullet and just as the brand of suzuki is weel designed in the market.the roads and mileage of the bikes on the roads is superb above 75+ and the petrol is just like 75 km/hr in the middle of this generation the youth shold have this type of bike and the bike should looking just wonderful so please buy this bike through your store near about your home and be careful with the handling because the suzuki brand launches the bikes and cars in india and other countries so smooth and colour and designed is too heavy and looks preety colour in the city when we are going some where,Suzuki
This bike is just way beyond saying anything but I think its price is quite on higher side but its value for money deal breaker.,Suzuki
This bike is most attracting bike and its all features are looking and working best.,Suzuki
This bike is not so much comfortable as the reviews are saying.the prices is very much and fuel comsuption is to high you cannot enjoy the lovely and comfortable traveling with this bike its damping system is totally fail and the speed like limit is not too good so its my advice to not wast your money to buy such types of bikes,Suzuki
This bike is perfect for any people body match. This bike is the very lowest price.price is 105000.00,Suzuki
This bike is readily being accepted by the youth of this country and I can see lots of Gixxer SF bikes in the market whenever I visit market. The display of this bike has special feature that it shows gear in which the bike is presently so that you need not to remember it.,Suzuki
This bike is really good and affordable. It is recommended to everyone,Suzuki
This bike is so cool. I was had a same colour bike and the nice of somes.and price is normal so everyone had this bike. I think this rating of bike is wrong.becoz I think up to 4.7 rating. and the model of the bike is brand new. in hindi: - mere pasand bhi yhi bike hain.or price bhi kuc jyada nhi hain.aam aadmi is bike ko aaram se effort kr sakta hain.or brand ki to baat hi mat pucho.or model bhi nya hain . look achi hai. in end look like sexy.,Suzuki
This bike is so good that it can overpower any bike in this segment.,Suzuki
"This bike is sports bike segment so looking dashing, sporty. Handling is quite heavy. Acceleration is awesome. Fuel economy is not so good but it's sport bike so don't judge fuel economy.

"This bike is value for money because under ₹ 87, 000, this is greate bike.",Suzuki
"This bike is very attractive looking and I love it first sight.but when I bought it I am very much disapointed and feeling guilty with my desision, it is very fuel consuming and it consumes one litere fuel petrol in just in 48-49 kilometeres.",Suzuki
This bike is very good bike .it has agood speed and it will be my always favoirite bike .the bike has a good pickup system.t je bike has very very good spwed and it can be made foe sports .ihis bike can also be called as sports bike .the bikes gives a good mileage and the bike has a reliable .this bike more comfortable and it is very very good bike .the bike jas a good road grip and then also tje bike has a good name suzuki gixxer an d the bike is popular in india .tje bike has a good electronic system machine to show thw petrol indicator as well as fuel or petrol.i love this bike body style and it ia more good and comfortable .the bike is very very good,Suzuki
"This bike is very good but it's comfort level is I think not good. It's mileage is good with the comparison of other sports bike. Before one year I buy this bike and I can see this bike is very trustable and it's feature is best with the comparison of other bikes because they show gear, speed and other new functions. The sitting management of this bike is not good but controlling is very good. It's road grip is very good because the balance of this bike is excellent. My appeal is provide good sitting quality.",Suzuki
"This bike is very very great in all like in Average, Performance, Look, and in awards.",Suzuki
This bike king of other stylish bike because of millage . 48 to 50 easily give you no any doubt.,Suzuki
This bike millage in pur litter 45-47. low cost manage every thing is good.,Suzuki
This bike really good choice in racing bike looking on thise bike is very good looking.I personally own this bike for 1 year.It is good bike within 92k( onroad price kolkata) .It is a fully faird bike weigh 139kg.Gear shift is not so good it is very clunky after one year it dosen't change too much. I get milage of 45kmpl I set my carb in richer side.The engine is 155cc aircooled. The engine is almost viberation free but little bit vibration is felt on foot pegs and handels over 7000 rpm. In high speed condition certain wind blow from side can cause littelbit disblance due to the fairing.It not compairable to sportsbike like yamah r15. Although it is a good entry level bike for daily commute but can't say fully sport bike because it has no no clip on handel bar but Very good product from suzuki . Style is very good it is truely grabs attention.,Suzuki
"This bike sports a 155 cc powerful engine. Compared to all the 150 cc bikes I personally feel that it is the most powerful engine. The sound of the engine is pretty roaring which gives you a sports bike feel. It has awesome pickup, not just the starting pickup but also while driving in 4th or 5th gear the bike gives good pickup.",Suzuki
"This bike the worst engine of 150cc ever. I mean come on if you are spending around 90, 000 rupees and you will get the engine which is only 150cc its really not good I guess, you can go for pulsar 220 which have a great 220cc engine but still in that bike also you will not get the control you need.",Suzuki
This bike was really awesome one .I would suggest this bike for everyone who have an idea of buying new bike. its an coolest bik comes on few colours. I would suggest you to get blue gixer sf which looks stlylish and sexiest look. the bike giving an good mileage. good performance and suitable for all youngsters and perfect to buy for all peoples. it has an 5 speed gear box with mono suspension. it has both self and kick start. I dont have words to explain about this bike just rocking and I loved it.,Suzuki

"This motorcycle is quite a favorite like of people the motorcycle is has also on my friend and he likes it very much, there is a wide range of motorcycle tires which makes it good for road, the silencer of thi bike is also different from other, if you are takit a bike by looking at the style and featr then do not forget this bike.",Suzuki
"This powerplant is mated to a five-speed gearbox, unlike the six-speed one on the GS150R. The engineers have set the gear ratios really well throughout the rev range and we never felt the need of the sixth gear. Suzuki's intention of developing an optimised powertrain with the five-speed unit has worked well. But only if the company could have kept the first two gears short, the bike could have sprinted better than the naked, especially considering the fact that it is also a bit heavier than the naked model. However, the gear shifts on the Gixxer SF felt a bit hard when compared to the naked version.",Suzuki
This product's design and layout is totally awesome. This product is completely different from other because of its lots of functions and features.,Suzuki
This review is totally based upon my personal views. I have driven this motorcycle for over 900km and the performance of the small 150cc engine shocked me. The motorcycle is totally lightweight and is a pleasure in corners. This motorcycle is very useful in the track too as the motorcycle flicks between turns and the acceleration according to the 150cc engine is mind blowing. The colour variants are also good here. Cost of maintenance is low and the motorcycle has got a beautiful low-end torque which is useful in city traffic. Highly recommended for people trying to get them selves a first motorcycle.,Suzuki
This suzuki gixxer bike is very good racing bike. the mileage of this bike is  good but not that much and its power engine is also good . this is high speed bike and comfortable to ride . the design of this is look gorgeous  and attracting look of this bike .the grip of the tire of this bike is also good and this bike is best for the bike rider and stunners and it is not so much heavy to ride for the youngsters. this is best bike for racing. 10/9 for this bike. lovable. fantastic.and well modified bike.,Suzuki
"This thing put me in dilemma, because it was true that though the bike's look, power were great,  the mileage and quality was weak point.  Also the Pulsar's engine is quite old.",Suzuki
This was my first impression and after that I fell in love with this bike.,Suzuki
"Though it has some demerits.bhp is less, no cut handle, seating is not good and long rides dont make us comfortable.i dont get the mileage that suzuki offers but will get around 45 per litre. It is good for small rides and is the best available bike with 155cc under 1.2 lakh.",Suzuki
"Though my bike is still new, it is giving me a good mileage. I ride in mixed conditions mostly and refuel once a week(5 litres of petrol), less than half of the fuel tank's capacity and still don't need to switch to Reserve mode. I hope you get the hint here.",Suzuki
"Thus, this bike definitely outshines the Yamaha FZ and is undoubtely the king of the 150cc segment",Suzuki
"To be honest I was not an issue in the first place with preload, but the bike was back once I load it with a back seat and have been victim speedbreakers. Not one to make a point of contact so Gixxer is solved. Yes, the ride is a bit stronger, but it is in no way offensive Gixxer and still runs like business as usual. And business is good.",Suzuki
"To be honest, we’re always looking for an excuse to ride the Suzuki Gixxer in one form or another, and the recent launch of a new version of the SF, featuring fuel-injection and a rear disc brake was a good enough reason to take it out for a spin. The Gixxer, and by extension its fully faired version, the Gixxer SF, have been game-changing motorcycles in the 150cc segment. They’ve not just cemented the company’s position in this segment, but also set a new benchmark against which all other 150cc street bikes will be judged going forward. Without a doubt, the Gixxer is one of the best 150cc bikes you can buy today. So, does the inclusion of fuel injection in the SF variant make it even better?",Suzuki
"To help this forum member and probably countless others seeking to learn more about their bikes, I'm supplying these definitions of terms used in typical motorcycle",Suzuki
"To match the macho stance of the fully faired bike, Suzuki has used 140 section tyre at rear and the bike gets Y-shaped three spoke alloy wheels.",Suzuki
Today I am going to tell about my personal experience on Suzuki Gixxer SF bike I bought this bike 6 months before this is a great bike to ride I am totally satisfied with the service of this bike.,Suzuki
"Today I am reviewing  SUZUKI GIXXER SF so lets get started so guys firstly  we will talk about mileage of SUZUKI GIXXER it gives a mileage of 40kmpl which is good and in city riding it gives 35kmpl which is also good and overall performance of the bike is really awesome it's a lovely sports, racing and performance bike we can say that comfort of the bike is very good because of rear mono shock nitrox suspension and Front telescopic suspension which provides better comfort and we are very reliable to Suzuki road grip of the bike is very good because of company provided more grip tyres I appeal to all those who are looking to buy this bike they can go through it.",Suzuki
Today I will review about a very and powerful bike Suzuki Gixxer SF. My classmate has this bike and riding this bike feels very comfortable and premium. This bike is beast with lots of power in it. It is a 150 cc bike with a fabulous look. It is launched with lots of improvement in its previous version that is Gixxer. Also the length of this bike has been increased from its earlier version.,Suzuki
Today its one of the cheapl and best sell by suzuki.its maintanence is too low and it has a sudden pick up.though a wonderful bikes its got some isssues,Suzuki
"Today we will talk about another sports bike, which is the suzuki company bike, whose name is GIXXER",Suzuki
"Top speed is around 127kph. amazing vehicle.The Suzuki Gixxer SF is essentially the Gixxer with the addition of that fairing. The only other addition to the frame is the hardware needed to mount the fairing. In that sense, you cannot take the fairing off and turn an SF into a Gixxer or vice-versa. Other changes include the top triple clamp and the tip of the unique exhaust, both of which are unique to the SF.",Suzuki
Tow seater bike is perfct nd dis bike touching on speed breaker .,Suzuki
Try to new features of this bike lounch new bikeand milage good try handling control is best and back space are not good lesss the price becouse the bike is not in publication spoot you suzuki gixxer sf good bike and focous on more feature,Suzuki
"UPDATE: The current version of this bike comes with ABS technology, so the safety has improved.",Suzuki
Under This Price Segment There Is No Chance In Hell You Would Get A Bike As Great As This SUZUKI GIXXER!,Suzuki
Under This Price There Is Not A Single Faired Bike You Would Get As Good Looking As This,Suzuki
"Unfortunately, the throw of light is low and the intensity could have been better. It might not cause any problems at night in the city, but for the enthusiasts who would want to take the bike out on long tours, night travel will be a tough task. Coming to the usage of the mirrors, the nature is exactly opposite to the usage of the headlight. The mirrors do provide a perfect sight and are stable on the highway, but are too wide making it difficult for the bike to pass between two vehicles in the city traffic with ease. Nevertheless, if it seems to be a hindrance, Suzuki has given users an option of fitting mirrors on the handle-bar like the naked Gixxer.",Suzuki
Unlike r15 the seat is so comfortable.I would honestly insist you to buy the suzuki gixxer sf rather than buying r15.,Suzuki
Unsure of the equipment list we can hope for the GSX-R250 to be more of a track oriented motorcycle which can be used for commuting purposes as well. Unlike Suzuki’s Gixxer 155-SF which focused on being a commuter motorcycle with a few bits of a sports bike.,Suzuki
Using my Suzuki since 10 months now. and there has not even a single day it had let me down. Its a head turner my friends .,Suzuki
Very comfortable .suzuki gixxer SF very heavy engein.this bike is very speedful and best milage of paterol in one kilometer.this bike sound very nice and his shape awesome and beautiful.and this suzuki Gixxer SF head light is very powerfull lazer light .my request all new customer of Suzuki GixxerSF bike is perfefect of you .this bike handling and control are very easy.beautiful bike.,Suzuki
Very cool its my choice my next bike will be that only soon I will take my friend have Gixxer SF soon I will get stunning bike for me. Trier grip is good while you are using disk breaks for both side front and rear also.,Suzuki
"Very few bikes in my opinion, can match gixxer's handling power.You will have to ride it to believe it , coz I m owning this wonderful bike nd enjoying it each day wenever I m travelling.",Suzuki
Very good bike. Superb mileage. I got 55 kmpl average. Pickup is best. Suspension is very heavy so we do not get jurk. Very stylish look. Dual disk break is also very nice . Digital meter consol is best I like it very much. Rear wheel size is big so we get better grip on the road. Fully fairing is the best. I like it very much.,Suzuki
"Very good performance and the best bike I have ever used I have never driven such   a good and comfortable bike I will suggest all my friends to buy this bike suzuki is doing a great work in the marker in recent years, .",Suzuki
"Very good performance and the best bike I have ever used I have never driven such a good and comfortable bike I will suggest all my friends to buy this bike suzuki is doing a great work in the marker in recent years, the design of this bike is relay awesome good bike in average good look good speed.",Suzuki
Very good performence. And the best bike I have ever used. I have never driven such a good and comfortable bike. I will suggest all my friends to buy this bike. Suzuki is doing a great work in the market in recent years.the design of this bike is realy awesome.,Suzuki
Very less room for pillion.With its great value for money with such an type of specs anyone buy this bike.Its doesn't matter where you are college going student or a office going employee this truely suits your commute.Hence suzuki gixxer sf is also known as best commuter inrespect of highway crusing or a city riding.,Suzuki
"Very smooth power delivery, Good front brakes, superb aerodynamics( I can ealisy do 100+ Kmph without feeling any wind blast) , Beefy exhaust sound while accelerating hard, Decent mileage ( 40-45kmpl) , and ofcourse the styling, It gets very good attention. Anyways I wont make it longer. If you want a 150cc mileage centred, super stylish, momey saving bike, then go for this. I am Loving it.",Suzuki
Very stable on road and rides smoothly in all weathers conditions.it is a gem in its class thanks Suzuki; for launching this bike,Suzuki

"We do wish the engine could have revved higher for more top end grunt, but then again, the Gixxer SF is not an outright track machine. The full fairing might suggest otherwise, but the SF is more set for touring than devouring a racetrack. The Gixxer is an agile motorcycle, and the addition of a fairing doesn’t change anything. The SF negotiates corners like its naked twin. Simply put – pick your racing line, and the bike will follow your inputs seamlessly though a corner. Though the bike feels stable at high speeds the motor sounds stressed at these points. The ride is a tad stiff, but if you can adjust the preload on the rear monoshock – which has seven different settings – to make the ride softer.",Suzuki
We will get back pain in just 30 mis from starting of ride. plz try to improve ur rates and comfort suzukiii .and also make the side stands as correctly . coz when we park the bike it will make us the bike ill fell down like thaughts plz try to improve this complaints and price adjustments and all .,Suzuki
Welcome to mouthshut.com This is review for a bike of suzuki .,Suzuki
"Well I have been in the pillion seat as well, we could feel the guttors",Suzuki
Well Not Only Fuel Efficiency Is Great But The Seats Are Soft and The Sitting Position Is Very Comfortable Too,Suzuki
"Well This bike is one of the best for beginners, It can give a mileage up to 37 to 41kmpl.Its really a comfortable bike in it's class it's riding posture is excellent for highway and city ride's.yes, its a very reliable bike, it's engine is very smooth and gearing also, Handling is very decent in city as well as while cornering, Yes it's a beginners bike it great and can be control it's 155 cc engine is very smooth and anyone can control it, It's looks are a little bit like hayabusa it's noticeable due to it's bright colour",Suzuki
Well for all of bike lovers looks are of great importance and for majority looks are the most important thing. And for them what else other than a fully faired moto gp edition blue motorbike will please their eyes. Suzuki has ticked the right boxes with the launch of gixxer and with sf now they also ticked the dreams of an average Indian biker to own a fully faired sports looking motorcycle Well to talk about the handling the bike is a leap ahead of gixxer which itself was best around the corners. The added weight of the fairing gives the front end much planted feel in corners and communicates excellent with the rider inputs. Well the large chunky section mrf tyres and beefy forks and stable chassis gives its excellent dynamics. So go for an sf even if style isn't your only priority,Suzuki
"Well for now suzuki comes into the compition of local area bikes like pulsar, hero, honda etc. Actually suzuki is a racing bike company and we all know it its racing bikes are out of our budget but dont worry this bike of suzuki will completely make you feel riding a racing bike. well u can see its look and that is amazing much like hayabusa bike of suzuki but its comfort is totally amazing, so looks are good lets talk about its power, with 155cc this bike has amazing pickup and u can compare its pickup with pulsar 180 both are same, the most amazing thing is its sound like an amazing racing bike. now the actual mileage of bike is 50km/litre and this is true . if u are waiting to impress anyone then this bike will surely help you and it is in your budget. GO FOR IT.",Suzuki
Well padded seat and super suspension shocker feel you comfort in riding and any road condition.,Suzuki
"Wheel Base of this is 1, 330 mm. nice Ground Clearance of160 mm.Seat Height is780 mm. comfortable for both driver and the person seating behind. price of bike is approximately 88 thousand with the warranty of 2 years. it is most awarded bike in year 2015. good mileage of 56 kmpl. nice style good chassis developed by engineers . good value for nice bike for a common man in budget bike.",Suzuki
When I  test to the bike up to  135 kilometre per second speed .Engine has a greater efficiency to create a maximum power and maximum torque in very less time.,Suzuki
When I am riding it its so much comfortable for me it has good milage its look like sports bike I like this soo much.,Suzuki
When I got it as new bike the mileage was upto 46 when I checked. but the moment they put their hands in first service the mileage dropped down to 38kmpl till now even after 8k km in the odo.,Suzuki
"When I heared about gixxer SF from my friends, then I go to the showroom, Then I take full information about it, then take a test drive, I fell awesome. I like the digital gear display, handling, controling etc.I love the sound of engine. Only one think I dislike that, I dond like this types of silencer.! Althrough the bike is awesome. I definetly recomanded to all guys, you should be bye this bike.",Suzuki
"When I m going to start Collage every body coming New New bike high cost bike .l am a middle class family . One day Suzuki lunch in this Suzuki Gixxer SF lowest price full vizier . This bike looking so sexy, oms looks, good handling, super millage but this bike pick up to good . Any road very good handling speed are staring handling nice . Two people are seating easy . Any girls are like so much . Specially Thanks who digging this bike and and specially thanks in Suzuki Company .",Suzuki
When I saw some pros of gixxer is good efficiency and has a abs system.,Suzuki
When I see this bike I only captured a image of dream bike which is so attractive by looks and the colour which the invented is so attractive make eyes stay on it . the best part this bike is it is fuel efficient and confort of riding in a rushy area handling and controls are supurb with the best highly equiped and get so much of equivalent.,Suzuki
"When I shift the Gear from 1st to 2nd, its not going to 2nd gear. Its going to neutral.",Suzuki
"When Suzuki had launched the Gixxer, they had made it clear that this 155cc engine is not a unit that the company shares with the commuter centric GS150R motorcycle. The engine is new and comes equipped with SEP(Suzuki Eco Performance) technology, which will help the motorcycle deliver both performance as well as fuel efficiency.",Suzuki
"When Suzuki launches its Gixxer series in market, everyone is expecting that this series may be astounding but the reality shrouded behind its looks. The rendition of Suzuki Gixxer SF is like a Firebrand sports bike although there are some new innovation like aerodynamic drag reduction and aluminium mufler which is not used before in street bikes. but still this bike is giving the appropriate power, in 155cc engine it is still giving 14PS powe and 14Nm torque. Suzuki has to know about that the liquid cooled engine gives little bit more power than the air cooled engine. in the price range of 89-92k it is average option. Top speed of this bike Reveal by company is about 127kmph and fuel efficiency is 40-50kmpl.",Suzuki
When im riding on this bike I complately feel sporty. I got 45kmpl avg Its a very good for me and in this bike 150cc angine so pickup is also very good of this bike. In this bike break is disc. When I buy this bike suzuki giving me free services and I satisfy with company free service because her service is very good. So I would recommand for this bike.,Suzuki
"When it comes to long rides, this bike is more likely to spell disaster with it's naturally cool engine. Not really cool, Yamaha -_-",Suzuki
"When u talk about looks the gixxer sf is the best bike the blue bike black seat yello with black tyres so the gixxer sf is the best bike for collage boys handling is assome comfort is best seat is full os sponge and fuel is tank is best the bettal, dis break awesome bike bro all and its realty it`s my dream bike my all frinds took this bike soo and ones again the looks soo nice control is best the bike is best. thanks",Suzuki
"When we hear about suzuki, the first name come into our mind is of suzuki hayabusa, but everyone cannot afford one.",Suzuki
"When we talk about the 'look' bikes, this bike is cool accordingding to me. When we talk about look it simply can challange the yamaha sports bikes in 150cc range. The sky blue colour is awsome on road.and gives a good look compare to other colour preference. Having 155cc engine it give nic pick-up and racing kick.",Suzuki
"When you are riding on gixxer sf, almost every eye catches you even kids and uncles hehe. So this is a unique bike as people are aware from yamaha R15, Yamaha FZ, KTM'S,",Suzuki
While driving its controls are very good it will not get disbalanced easily,Suzuki
While using this bike I didn't faced any problem like manufacture defects. The side mirrors are quit broad so you may face challenges while riding on small street. If you ask me to give rating on the look of the bike then I would definitely give full rating. One more thing is that it's price is not too much. It is affordable.,Suzuki
With a great outlook the all new stylish bike is with all newly added features . It runs lengthy on roads or has a good mileage . It has a very good road grip It can raise  upto an easy top speed of 120 kmph and also has better acceleration . it is quite pretty comfortable.,Suzuki
With all it ergo's which not only suits the urban traffic bt also able to cruse at highway  with an ease!Suzuki gixxer sf's strong point is its low end torque which is ample to leave the traffic far away from you.What I mainly like about Suzuki gixxer sf is its exceptional grip on the road.,Suzuki
With its all new 4 valve  engine it is  more fuel saving as well high accelerated bike . this bike is quite appealing . I would recommend it.,Suzuki
With pillion I used to get aprox35 to 38kmpl sometimes and with out pillion I get 40 to 42 kmpl,Suzuki
"With the success of Gixxer 155-SF, it won’t take much long for Suzuki to step up the game to entry level sportsbikes with their Gixxer 250.",Suzuki
Wonder full bike stylish good in seating for long drive mono suspension power full good mileage good sound firing tail light is very good looking front look ow some  you will love that bike sport lover or low budget macho man should have bike.,Suzuki
Wonderfully made machine by suzuki 155cc with fuelinjector.its has nice sitting posture.im using it since 1.6 years and getting a powerful response from the machine. Its afordable machine for every one. Its stylish design bold in looks amazing performance and fule economy is great . Can go for long rides without any ache. If one is planning can go for suzuki gixxer sf. High performance and services after sales are amazing. Go for it if you are planing,Suzuki
Wow.its an awesome bike.in india to get a sporty look bike in low cost this is best.it has a very good handling and tyre grip is very good.the top speed can be achived is 131km/hr.millage is gud if u drive 60-70 speed.over all average it gives of 40km/liter.the speedo meter is awesome and colour is best.just love my bike.one more thing about handling it is very good.even at 120 speed I take very sharpe turns it will be perfect.the only problem is that the bike gets off when it hits its top speed while leaving the accelerator.but by increasing fueling u can overcome this proble.rest every thing is perfect.,Suzuki
YAMAHA was the first to fuel India's obsession with its revolutinary track of YZF R15 in 2008 and this time SUZUKI is walking the revolutionary track with the hope of repeating history with its newly launched GIXER SF. The only fully faired motorcycle in the 150cc segment under 1 lakh. The Sf doesnot requires any fuel injection or liquid cooling.,Suzuki
Yamaha is also a very nice brand name but FZ is costly than this bike but in any case this is better than Fz.,Suzuki
Yamaha is fun to ride but Suzuki Gixxer Fi is Comfortable in Driving.,Suzuki
"Yamaha was the first company in India which introduce a fully fared 150cc motorcycle and Suzuki follows the same way but with different approach. This is the cheapest fully fared motorcycle in India and also this is not a fuel injected bike. The looks of the bike is no doubt one of the best under 1lac rupees with feature loaded instrument cluster. This bike is except the fairing same as its naked sibling, Gixxer which is not bad at all as Gixxer is a great bike. Gixxer Sf offers almost same mileage, performance, ride and handling as the Gixxer which are by far the best in segment along with more top speed on tap. So, if anyone wants to flaunt but has tight budget then nothing beats the Gixxer Sf.",Suzuki
Ye bike jo hai bahut dikhne me achcji hai aur is modification bahu acheche se ki ye bike jab riad par chalti hai to public to chalane wale ko kam bike jyada dekhte hai ue bike dosto aap logo bho lena chahiye kyunki ye chalane me maza aata hai aur agar aap ki koi girl friend hai to phir to aur maza ayega kyunki jab bike chalate ho aur breaker ata hai ua khadda ata hai aur break marte ho to girl friend aapki aap ke baho me hoki so ok dosto must buy this bike ok thanks.,Suzuki
Yeah and for this price I am pretty satisfied about everything else other than the seat cussion,Suzuki
Yes I am talking about all new GIXXER SF. I am a proud owner of gixxer. It is true that it isnt soo fast like r15 or duke. But it is also true that it is much more cheaper than this bike. So if I have a budget ranging between 90000 to 100000. So its the only fared bike. I bought a gixxer sf for 97000 rs final price on road pcmc rto. My parents had an issue with fast bikes so they were like no fast bikes u should buy. When the gixxer sf launched we had a test drive and it was incredible unique in handling and in mileage it is also true that it does not perform well if ur racing but it is so fast that there is no 150 cc bike which can compete with gixxer excluding r15. With the top speed of 130 my personal best. I feel it is more than sufficient for a bike in this category. And the body is so best at its aerodynamic that it dosnt have any vibration at top speed no air drag as well. I dislike about this bike is that it has a potential of a 6th gear which isnt present. You reach 5th gear so early and u feel like changing the gear and ur like this is the last gear so it is really disappointing. Popping a willi or a stoppie is so easy. Anyone having more budget and is a speedster should surely switch to duke.,Suzuki
"Yes it is sporty, the aerodynamic fairing does a great job in wind deflection which helps in cruising at high speeds effortlessly. When attacking a corner, the bike gracefully handles it as if it knows what is coming and immediately if we ride out of a corner, the bike rolls less gas and that is the throttle response that offers. You do not want to lessen a gear, go hard on gas, rev up to over take a vehicle. With a twist of throttle you can see the traffic getting vanished through your rear view mirrors.",Suzuki
Yes rided on Suzuki Gixxer SF which my friend had bought 3 months ago but I was not satisfied with this bike because its seat was not that much comfortable. This bike's headlights are very dull as its light reflection capacity is zero.,Suzuki
"Yes suzuki released gixer in 150cc segement and got failure due to performance of this bike is very worst that it can't get good pickup as it gives pickup like 125cc bike and design is looking like sport bike all are make from fibre and there is no safety in this bike that if any thing happens nothing is there bcoz all are fiber, giving good milage is not a good bike, by seeing realiblity on road it seems some what better and main thing is you not feeling any riding experience as sport bike only design is like that, it costs around one lakh five thousands and resale value is only 40, 000.has very bad resale value.",Suzuki
Yo the suzuki gixxer sf the best bike. The best ever. It is very good bike for the sport. It has great features inside it. It is at top among all bikes. It is speedometer attracts every person. It's millage is also good then other sports bike. And model of 2017 is better than otjer model. Suzuki has given best tyres. So it's road grip is very much good. We can take turn also in anyway. So grip of tyres is good and tyre are smooth. It has good sitting given by company. Two person can sit on it. It has smooth and soft sit. So we can use it for long drive. It has also good reliability. It has two cylencer. It has led light. It has look like bike named Hya Buza. So I appeal all buyers to buy this bike only not other bike. Because it is very good and also comes in less price also it is very good in comparison with other bikes,Suzuki
"You can buy this bike ONLy 83, 459 INR.this is realy a low prize for this bike because this bike have many intersting featuer.",Suzuki
"You can get many better bikes at that price range like avenger, apache, pulsur as 200, 180 , etc.",Suzuki
You can trust suzuki blindly because son cant teach father how to shave in other words nobody can teach the suzuki how to make a bike they are professionals all bike which is used in moto gp is made by suzuki so you can trust it blindly they never cheats your trust.,Suzuki
"You cannot specify resulting indicators if the result field is an array; you can specify them if it is an array element, or a nonarray field.",Suzuki
You get a disc brake and also the PICK up of the bike is fantastic.It is better than,Suzuki
"You guys need to work more on it . I will recommend the fi version , it is still ok but the SF is according to me a waste of money .",Suzuki
"You'll have a hard time riding with a passenger, it's going to be very slow if you do",Suzuki

`Hello guys.

at first I didnt like it but now I just cant leave without it.its changed my world takes me whrere ever I wanna go in a moment of time.,Suzuki
back seat is very narrow and not at all comfortable. sorry but its back seat deserve 2/5 only.,Suzuki
"bike is available in many colors and variant.Suzuki launched a Fi version of gixxer. When u ride dis bike u will feel d legendary name of the bike's family. Talking fuel efficiency in context its most fuel efficient bike in faired 150 cc sports bike segment. taking about comfort it has a sporty ergonomics with handle bar which is only a drawback,as it doest have fux or clip on handle . Bike is stable while cornering sticks to the road as it have nylo grip revZ M TYRE 140.bike looks stunning nd too sporty with a dual silencer.",Suzuki
bike is comfortable for every one for the driver as well as passeger bike is so reliable ad low cost maintaiace,Suzuki
"bike road grip not so bad, and it is better competition to other bike like karizma pulsar 220",Suzuki
but I think that it is a expensive product .you really want sporty look then recommended you to go for this bike.,Suzuki
but its looks erotic hyper series bike its blue colour I love it,Suzuki
but one thing is really good in this bike I guess and that is the mileage it'll will give you around 40km/h which is preety nice if you are a daily traveller than I think this is the great best and suitable bike for you.,Suzuki
but there spares are not available in near with you that is very draw back of these bike.this bije can givez the milage hs 47 perfectly but,Suzuki

"exlusively avaliable in all of the suzuki showrooms, and the showroom price ranges from 85000 to 115000.",Suzuki
fIrst of all we talked about mileage. So the mileage of this bike was very good for me.This bike will,Suzuki
far away and and cluch is not so smooth and braking is not finominal and I can not enhance your pleasure of ride.,Suzuki
finally I would like to appreciate its looks. I love its design. its design is very impressive. this bike is perfect substitute of many bikes but I don't want to disclose their names.,Suzuki
fuel consumption comparing others is quite low it gives 48 kmpl in the city road. which gives much more comfort in raiding . breaking is awesome but you have to take care of the front brake . handling control awesome another thing is the looks that content much to the youth which is supeer.,Suzuki
fuel consumption:this is having a normal consumption it is 47to50kmpl.,Suzuki
"give you  64 compile mileage.This bike has a superb engine of 155cc, whose max power is 14.59bhp",Suzuki
"good pick up and very sexy sporty looks as well, Suzuki is the my one favorite bike making",Suzuki
hahahahahah awsome gorgeous nice beautifull look like dashing fablous byc,Suzuki
"he SF with Fi is powered by the same 155 cc engine that does duty in the Gixxer motorcycle. Since Suzuki hasn't stated just how much the power and torque has increased, thanks to fuel-injection, we reckon it is marginal. This move comes in at the right time for Suzuki as the Indian government has decided to impose stricter emission norms for two wheelers which requires newly launched bikes to comply to BSIV norms by April 2016. This works quite well in Suzuki's favour as the new Fi system should bring down the CO2 emissions by quite a margin.",Suzuki
"he new fairing is in line with the elegant seat and the upswept tail piece, not giving a feeling that the fairing was an afterthought. Then of course, the large oval-shaped dual exhaust with aluminium muffler cover adds to the bling. The Y shape, three-spoke alloys from the Gixxer make it the best looking alloys in this segment. Not to upset fans and enthusiasts with skinny tyres, the Gixxer SF’s wheels are shod with a 140 section tyre at the back, which gives it a good street presence.",Suzuki
"he thing about fully-faired motorcycles is that they are easily noticeable due to the large panels that cover the engine and extend till the headlamp. Some motorcycles look really good, while some not so much with the additional unnecessary mass. Thankfully, the latter is not the case with the Gixxer SF, which is beautifully styled and looks good with the fairing that sports funky decals.",Suzuki
"headlamp brightness, no rear disc break, less aggressive seating posture.",Suzuki
iTs body design too good either thank others under it's budget but scratches are plenty in front doom. And tyres become fast tearing.need servicing for every 2 months.,Suzuki
iTs sporty look and classic design appeals good result . For every sport person and students it is useful.,Suzuki
if you dont beleive me then buy home a new gixxer sf then try it.,Suzuki
if you provede a racing look then you must suld provide a racing sound this is the only appeal to the suzuki,Suzuki

"it become a dream bike for all of those category and now a days film actors as well they are using this type of bike, it is kind of a luxury bike for those who are really looking to buy the model of bikes which are awesome to ride whithout looking the price.",Suzuki
it can reach up to 10 kmph than old version and top speed in my way is about 144 kmph,Suzuki
"it has a monoshock suspension at the rear wich gives decent comfort.the rear mrf tyres are little slippry at some times .the plastic qulity is poor for the switchs. the full digital display make u feel rich with gear indicator, time, 2trip meaters , and also a welcome speech by the beast ""go ready "" . all this for just 92, 000?",Suzuki
it has a tiny fuel tank of 12 literes. but its sporty alloy wheels looks so sporty and lovely and I love its styling.,Suzuki
it has only front disk and it has 155 cc engine its engine is very noicy and wibrates a lot when u ride it at a high speed and controling of this bike at a high spees is such a pain and it dont make u comrotable at the riding on the high traficing roads anf u feels bit nervous at a speed above 100 kmph so thats not good deal.,Suzuki
"it is comfortable bike only for boys, usually girls feels little uncomfortable. it have good suspensions so it gives good comfortable riding experience even in rural areas.",Suzuki
it is very reliable. Handling and control is fine on freeways and highways. Looks- thats' the best thing about owning this bike.,Suzuki
it was great for its price. but was a low power 110cc Engine which did not really impress me. hence it was Cleared from the list.,Suzuki

"its sportier, especially used by the college students to move on.",Suzuki
its sporty 150cc engine gives out a decent power of 14.5 bhp which is perfect for city rides. looks. its what suzuki had given the first proyority while making these little beasts . usually fared bike will not be puchier like their naked ones . but here the thing is revese . gixxxer sf has same to same intial like the naked gixxer and also 10km extra in the top speed than the naked. thats quite intresting . although its quite a bit awkrd in long rides small city ride makes u feel awsome .,Suzuki

"last but not the least, the show, design and the colour combinations beats any other bikes, I really love this bike.",Suzuki
"lets talk about the bike now: I have crossed 700 km now waiting for my first service, till the first service I have been asked to ride the bike below 4500 rpm which I think I m adhering the rule, so far bike is good in pickup, didn't check about mileage but I guess its giving me somewhere around 45kmpl, as its a new bike engine is not as refined as what u expect but its negligible and gear shifting is bit hard(hope these two issues of refinement & smooth gear shifting will short out after first service), I love the way this bike holds the road, I recently got saved by this bike because of its bulky MRF tyres, I was at 45-48kmph speed and due to a very bad pothole I applied a sudden break, my rear tire did slip a bit but nothing happened to the bike, it slipped and I changed the gear from 5th to 1st quickly then ran again in 1st gear, so for handling I will give it 10/10, looks is awesome, pillion seat is a bit hard if pillion is for more than 20 minutes, bike is running good, so far no problem and hope this bike last for 3 years without any problem.",Suzuki

the people who are wanting to have more power and a better pick up I would tell you to wait as it cannot give enough power and the pickup in the 1st gear is slow compared to a yamaha r15. yes the comfort level is much more but the feeling of speed is not there. if the company launches the 250cc version of this bike in India you should buy that. And also there is no ABS in the bike so use that front brake carefully.,Suzuki

That bike can easily reach 0 to 60 in just 3.4 seconds and 0 to 100 in 6 seconds only. It's a eye catchy machine you will feel proud on the  road.",Suzuki
"Okay let me start my review with my buying experience. I was looking for a 200 cc bike or a bit higher and my budget was under 200k at the time my choices was re thunderbird and rs 200 cause they are cheap and i personally like the unique looks the bikes has to offer. At the time sf 250 was priced at 2006000 in my state, but i got it for 192000 as they were clearing out bs4 models.First ride was amazing i instantly fell in love with the looks and the ride comfort, its sporty but not as sporty as r15 and very stable you wont feel the bike wobble at all trust me on this. Also a point to add is the suzuki easy start system its a big plus.The looks sf 250 has is truly different and unique (also its not a common bike as the re in kerala, everyone is riding re here nowadays) so i really like the attention my bike draws in.The first free service at 300km cost me around rs.900 with including chain lube, oil change and washing etc.Two cons i can say is that1. The side stand is pretty straight compared to other bikes so be careful while parking on a slight sloping ground. 2. And all the spare parts are not readily available. When my cousin dropped my new bike just 2 days after i got it, i was shattered i thought the faring was gone. But honestly there was only a scratch on the faring that too on the sticker but the mirror and clutch lever broke. The service center guys was very calm and supportive about it they ordered the parts and replaced it. (took around 1 week for the parts to get here that's one of the cons i mentioned).All in all a good bike very study and comfortable 10/10 suzuki.",Suzuki
"All the issue that i addressed in my first review still not cleared completely. Now i ridden this bike around 7k km completed ""3"" services.At 4k km,the showroom finds that it was the faulty 'O'-ring(but not) in the gear box that makes the gearing issue(but one of friends workshop told me that it is the gear selector issue).but the factory warranty, i ended up giving my bike in the showroom and take a week to repair.They changed the ""O"" ring only. Once i got the bike after repair found that the clutch became hard and a tight feel from the engine while throttling.But the issue is still there though and found that this is common issue for the gixxer series so many of my friends are reported this gearing issue as well as the oil leak issue from the engine. The first oil leak came at 3500km from engine head,after ridding 3k km oil leak came back from  same spot at 6500km. At the the time 3rd service was done,but the engine head gasket wasn't changed they just tightened it because they don't have the gasket it was out of stock.I can still see the wet surface on my engine head.....I decided it was my last visit to suzuki service and i won't bring back my bike to suzuki service centre. So i decided to do my upcoming services and repair from local workshops.....",Suzuki
"Buying experience- never buy bike from rock suzuki byculla/ mahim, they not handling client properly & poor service Riding experience- bike is so much amazing for cruising on highway & very comfortable but not good for traffic condition Pros- premium looks, no heating issues, bike runs very smoothly, easy to overtakes, Cons- slipper clutch missing, headlight throw is not that much efficient, small digital meter, parts not available at workshop, price little high  Servicing and maintenance- pocket friendly (mark suzuki sion-  good service experience).",Suzuki
"You will feel special when you ride this machine. It has nice riding position compared to other full faired bikes available in India in that price range. Mileage is good for its engine.. I am getting average of 35-40 depend on riding condition, as i ride in extreme speed. I have touched a maximum of 148km/hr with this bike. It's performance and pick up is smooth. Maintenance cost is not that high, as the regular service cost me around 1000rs/- in service centre. Have a test drive and i assure you will feel like buying it.I just feel a bit disappointed by its exhaust sound and horn could have been a bit more louder to suit its looks and design.",Suzuki
Pros:1. It has a rev happy butter smooth engine.2. The range and visibility of the led head lights are great.3. The sitting posture is not too aggressive and it is good for commuting as well.4. Fit and finish of the bike is excellent.5. It is well stable at the high speeds.6. The socs works well both at high ways as well as in bumper to bumper city traffic's.Cons:1. It would have get a better brakes.2. It misses out slipper clutch.3.Feeling a little buzz in seats while revving upto the redline. 4. Pillion seat is less accessible for ladies.,Suzuki

Look was so awesome, i love that look and pretty good 4.Servicing and maintenance that was awesome.",Suzuki
"Buying experienceI bought this bike on march 2022 from malappuram suzuki showroom in kerala. I got it for 218000 on road. I choose the bike delivered in the showroom 2 days back, with a manufacturing date within a month (to avoid getting possibly misused bike). The delivery experience was really nice.Riding experienceIt is a perfect bike for those who want just one bike for both daily, and city use and for weekly touring. It has decent low-end torque which makes it easy to ride in cities. Just release the clutch in first gear, and the bike will go at 12 kmph speed without touching the accelerator (in 2nd gear, at 18 kmph). It has good ground clearance, so coupled with good low-end torque helps in handling mild off-roads as well. On the highway, you can tour all day at 90 to 120 kmph without any vibrations. After 120, you'll feel little vibes in the foot pegs and seats, and it can reach up to 154 kmph at which the rpm limiter kicks in. The seating position is very comfortable for a sports bike, so long-distance touring is not an issue.Looks, performance, etc.It looks superb from the sides and back. I'm not a great fan of its front design as it is a little lowered (inspired from katana's design). But if you put on a tall visor, this problem might get solved. The headlight is very good. Even low beam gives you good visibility. The performance is very decent, and you'll be able to beat most vehicles in the road in terms of acceleration. I tested its mileage multiple times, and i always got in the range of 38 to 41. For me, it has the perfect balance between performance and mileage.Servicing and maintenanceIt is the cheapest 250cc to maintain. As it is the only bike with a fully oil-cooled system (let me tell you, it is suzuki's patented technology, and even better than many liquid cooling systems found in other bikes in this segment), there is no need for coolant, and no oil-coolant mixing issue (very common in ktms and bajaj).  It cost me around 1100 rupees for 1st service and less than 900 rupees for the second service.Pros and consDefinitely, the pros outweigh the cons. I already mentioned every major pro. Now coming to the cons. It's wind visor is too small, but you can find many after-market options (rr310's visor is a good option). Being a sohc engine, there is a little bit of vibration at higher rpms (above 6-7k), but not a big issue (i think only those used to honda and yamaha bikes will notice this). Gear shift is precise, but a little hard (but you won't notice it if you use good footwear). Back seat is comfortable but positioned a little higher, so climbing is a little difficult.  Conclusion -> it is a seriously underrated machine. I'd say you must take a test ride of this beast if you're planning to buy a bike under 2.5 lakhs.",Suzuki
"This bike is superb in terms of:1. Built quality2. Engine performance3. Ride comfort4. Milage.5. design in addition to above noted few more things as The design is very eye catchy and u will be first among while accelerating from a signal. The engine has enough grunt and punches in all gears and rpm. The headlight throw is pretty enough. The disadvantage i felt was the visor is not purposeful, but can be replaced with jb visor or any other from the aftermarket. This is one of the best 250 bikes with no heating issues and can be used for daily commuting and touring as well.",Suzuki
"It is a brilliant bike. Which is more versatile. Handles city duties, touring really well. Suspension setup is brilliant. You can scrape your footpaces. Looks are super cool. Better than any bike in this segment. Rather spending 2 Lakh on a metal vibrators from Royal Enfield  get this gem. You will certainly not get disappointed.",Suzuki
"Engine usability- 5/5, torquey, pickup for 6th gear is as low as 35kmh. No need to exhaustingly rev the engine, effortless.Handling- 5/5, superb, extremely predictable.Suspension- 5/5, absorbs and smoothens out all the sharp imperfections and all the normal road imperfections but still maintains a bit of stiffness at corners.Engine power-5/5 is adequate, not overwhelming.Seat comfort-4.5/5, balanced, good enough for long rides.Braking- 4.5/5, progressive and not aggressive, manageable.Mileage-5/5, overall 49.9kmpl before the first service.Looks- 4/5, good enough.",Suzuki
"Hello. I bought my Gixxer SF 250 matt black on October 2020 from bangalore Meghdooth motors. The buying experience was very good. I decided to go with SF 250 mainly because of the riding comfort (not too dynamic and not very upright also) considering its a sports tourer and i wanted a faired motorcycle. Pros-Good power delivery, loved the design, definite attention grabber on the road mileage city- 35, highway-37.5Comfortable riding posture, stable at 145km with pillion Cons:-Back breaks could have had better bite, not the most effective wind blast at 110+Pilion comfort is good, but not suitable for long rides, no issue faced till now 4000 km. ",Suzuki
I am telling all you guys to just purchase this bike. I have experience of this bike and it has double exhaust. The power is amazing. It does not vibrate. The seat is amazing. You all will feel very comfortable. Just buy this Suzuki bike and tell your friends also to but this bike. It is a good bike in a budget of 1 lakh 50 thousand.  It really good in looks.,Suzuki
"It's a quality product in the 250cc category. Suzuki has blended performance, styling, ease of maintenance, and usability in the right mix.The bike can be used daily for commuting and for occasional long rides. It seldom feels cumbersome & gives you riding pleasure from a great engine. I would vouch for the gixxer sf 250 anyday of you're looking for that right balance of performance, economy & comfort.Cheers!",Suzuki
1. Buying experience was very good.2. Riding experience is upto the mark. In highway it is very much stable to clock triple digits speed. But in city it feels slightly on the heavier side when you filter through city traffic.3. The 249.3 cc motor that pack with power and mileage. In this premium quarter-liter segment who are looking for a all rounder package here's the search end. On highways it can easily maintain triple digits speed with a decent mileage. And look wise it's a head turner machine. When I ride this machine everyone makes a look on it. I have the suzuki 100th year anniversary moto gp colour scheme. For that this bike looks like a big bike. 4. But here i little disappointed. Suzuki's spare parts are not easily available in the market. You find spare parts most of the time but sometimes you have to wait for spares. But maintenance is too cheap. I just did the 1st service with a 1400 rs bill. I used Castrol power 1 ultimate 20w50 for my motorcycle.5. Pros:• looks are the up to the mark.• performance  is enough for your all rounder performance.• braking are superb and handling on a stiffer side that decrease your comfort but increase your handling with a dual channel abs set up.Cons:• missed out led indicator.• little windscreen is not helps much when you are on highway.• assist and slipper clutch are missed out.,Suzuki
"Well i am the 1st buyer of SF250 moto gp in my state. There is no better bike than sf 250 in the quarter litre sport bike segment. This bike is solely responsible for uprooting Honda cbr from the Indian market. As i have owned a cbr 250 also, I can easily say SF 250 is much better. The engine is smoother and more refined, looks much better than CBR n KTM RCs which look too bad after the bs6 update. Only R15 v3 is close to the looks but v3 is ridiculously expensive as a 150 cc bike.Coming to the performance, it is gonna be 2 years now from the date of purchase and this bike never had any major or minor breakdown apart from the battery issue in lockdown. It can be easily used for your daily city rides. With a ground clearance of 165 mm, it absorbs the bumps smoothly. On a track or even on highway, u can touch 150 easily on the speedometer. I have even gone to the beach side of my state riding it for 4 hours and have not felt any pain. With the stock tyres of MRF revz, it is the best bike as RCs also come with the same stock tyre now after the bs6 update and R15 v3 and even Ninja 300 have MRF zappers as stock tyres which will last for hardly 2 years. The only bike better than it is RR 310 which has become a dream bike after the bs6 update but the only reason I didn't buy it was the unavailability of the blue colour. Finally, I must conclude that my biggest satisfaction came when my mom could sit on the sf 250 comfortably that she could never do on the cbr for 6 yrs.",Suzuki

The only bike better than it is RR 310 which has become a dream bike after the bs6 update but the only reason I didn't buy it was the unavailability of the blue colour. Finally, I must conclude that my biggest satisfaction came when my mom could sit on the sf 250 comfortably that she could never do on the cbr for 6 years",Suzuki
"It took slightly more than 3 months for the delivery due to lockdown. Only then I got the opportunity to get onto the bike and the seats and the riding position were not that sporty but was quite comfy. Then they did the paperwork and docs whilst I waited and then the bike was delivered.     Now i cranked the bike for the first time and i was not impressed at all because the vibrations were quite a lot more than what I've thought would be. I was wandering weather this was a bike from the recalled ones due to the improper balancer gear position thing but for my good, it was not. Then I started riding it to my home and it was quite a good experience altogether. The suspension was quite stiff and the feel of the motorcycle felt like something else (awesome) that I never worried about the vibrations during the drive. The headlights were super purposeful and the gears were quite precise and not that much hard as of said in few reviews.    The performance was not extraordinary or something of that sort but was sufficient (not as crazy as the KTM ones). The front brakes were good enough but the rear ones are pretty pathetic. But combining both it'll stop at your command. Since i rode it home when it was rainy I felt quite a bit of moist warmth coming from the fairing but there's absolutely nothing to worry since this motorcycle does not heat up that much.      The handling is not as good as the r15 but is pretty decent at best.     I've ridden around 160 kms as of now and a noise started around the clutch area of the gearbox. The noise stays when the bike is in neutral and idling but when I depress the clutch the noise goes away. I don't know why this happens to a brand new motorcycle. Have to check with the service centre yet. The looks are the one which made me love this machine. Lets wait and see how far and long this bike can hold.",Suzuki
"1) Dream bike, just test drive and bought without any confusions.2) loved it, it makes the city ride enjoyable.3) Have great road presence, superb performance.4) Decent service cost.5) Pros- comfortable sitting posture, great mileage, beautiful looks, enough power.     Cons- horn doesn't suit bike worst",Suzuki
"I bought it from Shiv Suzuki. They delivered me the bike in 1 week after all paperwork and payment. It was a hassle-free experience from shiv suzuki.Before coming to the decision of buying gixxer sf250, I tested r15 v3 and pulsar rs200, though I liked yamaha for their engine smoothness and ride quality,  I was not impressed with the overall dimensions of R15 v3, it hurt my back like hell. It might be the physical limitation considering my height (5""8) and I was not keen to buy RS200 either considering Bajaj's long term cost of ownership. Initially, my plan was to buy 150SF but when I saw 250SF in the showroom with matt black finish I was blown away by its looks. Even today you won't go unnoticed riding on this in public. Performance-wise it's a really a smooth bike, I have been using it for almost a year and haven't faced any issue while doing so. My daily running is 35 kms which I cover almost within 0.8-0.9 liter of petrol. The engine is calibrated powerfully  yet economical considering the 250 cc capacity of the bike. I go up to the speed of 100 km/h without feeling the windblast but post that you can feel the vibration in the engine but anyways who goes post 100 km/h on indian roads. Another issue that I feel with suzuki is hardness in gear shifting I have driven apache 300 and re classic 500 cc but that didn't feel this hard like 250cc. I have cut off 1* only for that (consider it as 4.5) For free service, suzuki charges 900 Rs for an oil change but I think it should be free of cost for the first 3 services. Pros: riding comfort, ride quality, performanceCons: hard gear shifting",Suzuki
"I went to buy r15 initially and find it very uncomfortable and for 155cc bike i didn't want to spend that much amount, so thought to check on gixxer sf250. Fell in love on the very first glance with silver triton colour. I've booked the bike in the noon and delivered in the evening.Riding experience: bike performance was very smooth and seating position for rider was very comfortable. I went on a road trip for 300 kms recently, till 200kms on a single go I didn't find any problem with seating. I've done a top speed of 151 kmph on express highway and bike was very smooth till 120 km/h and pickup was very good. Easy to control and easy to maintain. In city I used to get mileage of 35 km/l and on highway I've got approx. of 33 km/l because of speed factor where I've constantly driven over 130 kmph over an period of 90 minutes.Pros : good looking, very comfortable, mileage, maintenance, pickup, smoothness, controlling.Cons : instrument cluster is very basic, horn sound is like scooty, bit noisy on gears shifting, rear brake could be better, visor could be little big bigger,",Suzuki
"The bike as once Varun painter from power drift put it, is very good at everything, but lacks that soul connection with the rider. And he is partly true. The bike looks good mostly and the mileage is great at almost 40 km/l when ridden sensibly in city, 45 km/l on highways within legal speeds, with the stupendous fast race to top speed available at all times. Running costs including service costs, parts are not expensive compared to peers. Comfort is not a problem unless you are in sticky traffic when the clutch hand will start to pain. This brings to the fault with this bike, at this price slipper clutch should have been there.Now when I said Varun painter was partly correct, its because the bike, while it has a soul, it comes alive after 5.5k rpm and to have fun, you need to keep it above 5000 rpm in lower gears while negotiating city traffic, it's fun but risky!You are doing 75 km/h at 5000 rpm in 6th gear. At 6000rpm its 90 km/h and its pretty fast. But the urge to give a bit of throttle is always there, for the exhaust sounds sweeter. Even more so when an underpass, or tunnel comes. And you may not want to quickly exit those underground parking lots, enjoying that angry, sharp exhaust note.So for daily commutes, they will be normal for the most part, relatively quiet and comfortable, but faster than the normal 150cc crowd without even making an effort. And if you want to have some thrills, it comes after 5000 rpm for some spirited riding, all along with howls and burbles of the twin barrel exhaust.It's very practical within limits, but that's just your sensible enough.",Suzuki
My buying experience of this bike is like I was too excited for this bike because in Lucknow my 250sf was the first or second bs6 sf250.2. Bike is too smooth and has a feather fine and refined engine it cruises like a tourer and has a speed of 157 kmph and shoots like a sports bike.A pure all-rounder for everyone I guess.3. In love with its tail section single-piece fenders and those macho tyre of 150/60 R17 section. The front feels like sharp as a shark and a bit like a raven mighty and bulked up 4. Maintenance cost is on the higher side but once maintained then you don't have to worry about anything.5. Could get a bigger display  . A taller visor to cut off all the windblast.  . The handlebar was set at a higher level than any sports bike.Pro's  . Has a refined engine    Has the best mid torque   . And has an ample amount of power and torque in this segment.,Suzuki
"Its a perfect all rounder bike for younger generation, I own 2 gixxer sf250 in the family. The refinement is in par or better compared to yamaha or honda 250 cc bikes. I would suggest to be careful during the first 2.5-3k kilometers to limit the speed under 80 km/h. I know it is frustrating but the magic happens once the unofficial break-in period is over.This pickup is very mature and reached 100 in no time, I would recommend to use on straight highways, city riding may be painful for taller riders due to the aggressive position.The mileage is around -35 to 40 km/l 4 valve dohc engine, to summarize if you are short or medium height, under 35 years of age , and an all-rounder bike and do not plan to change for the next 15 years, this bike is for you.",Suzuki
"I was first going to buy fz25, but decided to go for this bike instead because whatever the fz25 lacks in, gixxer 250 makes up for it. I wanted to go for the naked version first but when i saw the faired sf 250, i was sold! the bike is beautiful to look at in person. The build quality of plastics is really good and so is the overall fit and finish of the bike. Even the engine is amazing and exhaust has a soft bossy grunt to it. The 250cc gixxer are a bit sporty to ride too, as in you'll have to lean a bit forward to hold the handle. So if you're not riding it correctly, you will start feeling pain in your wrists and shoulders. The naked version has a slightly more raised handlebars then the faired one. But the posture is comfortable and both these bikes will do well for long rides too. They are very easy to use in the city as well. The only major downside to this bike is that the paint quality is poor when you shine a light to look at the bike chassis, the models i saw in the showroom had paint chipping off from the welded portions of the frame and rust had to started to form on it too. Even the saree guard had rust forming on it. And this for the 3 bikes i saw in the showroom, they were just 4 months old bikes. Even some owners have reported rusting issues with these bikes. That is the only thing making me a bit hesitant to buy it, cause when we are paying above 2 lakh rupees for something, is it wrong to expect our bikes to look brand new atleast for the first year or two? and this is supposed to be Suzuki's premium offering developed exclusively keeping the indian market in mind. I feel like when it comes to the Japanese big fours, the premium offerings from honda and Kawasaki are of top quality available in the indian market, but it comes at a hefty price. Even though the gixxer 250s and the fz25s maybe a few steps down in quality, they are much more reliable and better bikes than any offerings from indian bike manufacturers, period. For all my gripes, i might still go for gixxer sf 250 as its the only faired sports tourer in my budget range, that is unless cbr 250 gets released next month...Fat chance! I'll be posting a follow up review after completing 10k kms on this bike.",Suzuki
"Bought this bike in November 2021 , and ride it for 6+ months as of now with odo less than 5000km with 2 services done to date. First of all the buying experience was good, got this bike on the same day I booked it. I did not like its look before the purchase, I just wanted a full fairing bike as I have a previously owned naked fz16 (2014). There are 4 fully-faired bikes in India - r15, gixxer, ktm and apache rr310. I rejected r15 as it is under power and I already have a 150cc bike so wanted to upgrade the cc. Rr310 and ktm were a bit costly for me. So I decided to go for it. But when I saw the bike in front of me in the showroom I just fell in love with it. It looks stunning, fully rocking. Everyone knows it is the most underrated bike due to Suzuki's poor marketing strategy and I loved it because I don't see many bikes the same as mine, feel unique. Now come to the performance. Its pickup is great, very fast, always wanted to rev, smooth buttery engine sound, very refined engine, handling is superb and look wise eye-catching and stunning. Service cost is also too low. It gives me around 35-40 kmpl. The bike price is very low, it costs me 216000. Seating posture is too good, there is no way you can feel any back pain, you have to lean but not that much like r15/ktm. The back seat is very high and that is perfect for a sports bike as I think. The rear tyre is fat 150/60. Overall it is the best 250cc machine in all aspects along with its price tag. I am very much happy with it, it gives me enough pleasure when I ride it. I have not found cons except the one during heavy traffic the wrist of hand feels some pain but that is ok. I must say it is the king of the road. And I want to say to the upcoming r15 buyer, don't go for r15 when you have a 250cc beast in the same price range. Though I believe r15 looks a little better but that doesn't mean sf250 looks ugly. In the end, overall cc, as well as performance, matters the most.",Suzuki
"Paying 2 lahks above and getting a bike like Suzuki's refinement level is good but Suzuki needs to work more in terms of looks, they should give a better windshield slipper clutch n more about like facemask it can be a better deal otherwise other segment bikes can be more valuable o wish in next update Suzuki is working on it instead of launching other bikes.",Suzuki
It's a good bike for mostly daily commuting and also for touring. The oil cool engine is far better than pulsar 220. And apache 200 4v. It's mainly a sport tourer not a sporty choose as gixxer 155(new version) . But all over good and engine sound and reliability is simply awesome.Thick 150 rear tyre provides good balance. Mainly the mass balancing is so good that you would not feel a heavy weight when it's not running.,Suzuki
It is good bike.. Very very smooth.. There is not heating problem... Average current mileage 32km... Sound awesome... Its is comfortable also.... Handling is also good in city.. But on highway there is windblast after 140+..Overall a good bike with awesome build quality. The bike is powered by a brand new air- and oil-cooled 249cc single-cylinder engine that has been developed specifically for the gixxer sf 250.,Suzuki
"Riding experience is really amazing / very sporty look, easy handling, seating comfort is good..dual channel ABS works so perfect / engine response is also excellent, overall perfect bike from Suzuki / concern is on colors if Suzuki come up with some more colors it will be good. Will recommend everyone to buy it.",Suzuki
"At the time of buying the bike looked and performed fine but after a few days let's say after 400kms it started showing all kinds of problems 1. The bike has very poor throttle response , after every gear change when you try to accelerate it makes knocking sound which will make you uncomfortable and will  make you wonder if anything is wrong with the bike . Which is not present in 150 cc gixxer. 2. Its a touring bike but vibrations creep in after 4000 rpm 3. Gear change makes a lot of noise , just like bajaj bikes 4. The rear brake flutters when you hard break above 50kmph (probably fixable) Note:  will post update after first service.",Suzuki
"I purchased this bike 2018 Gixxer sf top model and I huge satisfied with this bike I love everything like look, Speed, And Average. The first time I see this bike only one thing in my mind Can I purchase my dream bike I save money for I this bike purchase early and I got it I have my dream bike",Suzuki
I have gixxer sf 250 & i have driven it for 450 kilometre and i am facing some issues.1. Mileage Bike is giving me mileage of 24 kmpl for my daily city ride and after 1st service it is giving same.2. Heating issue. Bike gets heat within 10 min and heat can be feel on the leg of the rider............,Suzuki
"Straight to the experience of riding this motorcycle, Suzuki has done justice to the 250cc segment and bringing up a new competitor and machine into it. The machine is completely refined and a well built faired motorcycle. Had so many wonderful riding experiences with this machine. It's a complete package. A slipper clutch would have been nice but more or the same, the bike is an eye-catcher.",Suzuki
"I was researching and done test ride in following segment bikes ,especially in 200cc ,250 and 400 CC  . in which TVS 200 RTR ,Bajaj Ns200,Honda cbr 250 Thunderbird ,Java ,KTM ,FZ S, MT 15. finally I have filtered TVS RTR, Bajaj NS 200, dominor.TVS having a starting problem in wet condition and NS 200 is having chain sprocket problem in very short time .dominar had been updated recently but it is a star and very comfortable bike with very good road presence but the mileage of the dominar is 18  in the City 22/24 max in highway ride. since I'm in 30 s .I need to ride with kids.so I always search for street bike I never tried on R15. because of the seat height but I love that sporty type.after searching so long time finally I have seen the ad of Suzuki from the house of Hayabusa. the Hayabusa was dream for me .finally I book a test drive .I've done 150 cc and 250 CC both . oh my God when I sit in the bike and when I accelerating be the sound was like a double barrel very convincing. I prefer 250 coz dual abs and more power with the matte black.. in 150 cc you have shine black and shine silver. bad braking in 150 ccriding experiencesrefined engine the . excellent breaking ,stylish look ,beast definitely, catch stranger eyes while you drive, mileages 24 in city e 28 to 30 in highway just now for service done they charge 900 rupees 1.2 litre oil change and chain lubricant done I suggest you people to buy your motul chain lubricant for every 500 kilometre u can lube yourself for change life otherwise you need to go to service centre and they will charge hundred and fifty rupees for that with GST of  course pros1. value for the money2. best in class very stylish appealing3. refined engine headlight and tail light LED was awesome4 excellent breaking dual abs5. sure man, you are roadside stranger will definitely ask. when you stop in signal or traffic someone will definitely ask you which company bike ?is this is it imported?6. my top speed is 140 and it's very quickly to reach hundred with 6 speed gearbox . I almost drag race between all segment which I said above still I didn't do with KTM but Suzuki is the winner with above all especially with 250 cc but I know KTM is also the beast in speed.cons1. back sitting quite high but lower than R15. so that if you go with your wife or girlfriend they will be ok for 20 minutes or half an hour without any problem after that surely they will I lye over  you and it will be a extra pressure for you to seat and to handle the situation and the backseat of will be holding your shoulders or hits there is no grip to hold anywhere else.2.bad horning definitely not for this bike convincing 3. shock absorber is not that much convincing4. very important when I gone long drive is about 250 kilometres . single cylinder oil cooled unit got activated I believe but normally will activate. but in extra distance the engine was over heated and cooling system does the job.but the point is ,the heat is passing your legs ..u can actually feel it from your left knee part to calves  does from the engine .even I was wearing a jeans still I feel the heat of the engine on my left leg. I just thought if I wore a shorts or track pant..it will definitely hurts. cannot bear the heat this is the only major problem which I face...but still I love it...you cannot expect 100% ..it's omitable in long rides.guys hope I had given a honest review...but everyone have their own view and taste. I had given mine.so enjoy riding SF 250.",Suzuki
"awesome machine in 250 segment.. Super riding throttle is very nice, very comfortable handling, seating also very good. I have ride my gixxer 1300km it very awesome performance, braking also very good. fully faired looks make u feeling different from other.. people ask to me & notice to me. cons :- only on windshield.",Suzuki
"There is a slight difference between r15 and this if you want looks then go for r15, if you want raw power... I would choose Gixxer any day, reliable on bad road conditions, and you might have to keep an eye during rainy seasons, but overall very satisfying product, doesn't need whatsoever ever fancy service, and provides long-lasting fun.",Suzuki
"Pros:1. Simple 250cc engine with good performance2. Easy to maintain, not necessary to take to service centre often, much reliable3. No heating issues4. Good kmpl for 250cc motorcycle5. Riding ergonomics6. Good stock headlightsCons:1. Poor service from showrooms2. Little mods available3. Fit and finish could be better but for the price it is ok4. Need a visor change for better win protection5. Stockhorn is the worst6. Tank grips should have been there7. It's a hassle to find spares but aftermarkets do better than originals.",Suzuki
"The suzuki gixxer 250 is an ideal motorcycle for anyone who is looking for a city-friendly vehicle beyond the 100cc-150cc space. It packs a good amount of mid and top-end performance while its handling prowess further aids its case. The original gixxer was a splendid motorcycle and one that we really enjoyed. This one offers an experience along the same lines, but with the welcome addition of that extra performance, we’ve been craving for all these years.",Suzuki
"Hello i have gixxer sf250 so what overall the bike is pretty good but its has some problem, it cost me almost 2 lakh rupees on road but still its have no slipper clutch and gear shifting is hard back side is quite high and the main problem is wind shield it is totally useless some time it gets overheated in traffic but still its good for everyday uses.",Suzuki
"This is my first bike and i occasionally rode friends' gixxer and ns200. I thought of getting dominar but due to their '""amazing customer care"", i couldn't even get a test ride. But i made a good choice considering performance-mileage aspect. I am not a slow rider and not a maniac either. So, riding conditions are mixed and would love to keep my speed at 70 to 90-100. This bike excels at those speeds with great mileage and unbelievable ease.  I don't believe in people who say 90kmph is normal on naked or 150cc bikes. Those speeds are little uncomfortable for both rider and engine.  This one handles that speed pretty well with some wind protection.Best things:1. Acceleration: nice linear-pull during 3-7k rpm. You will enjoy that smoothness it gives you along.2. Oil cooling: very effective.  Not a gimmick at all.3. Stability: good stability at high speeds and nimble at low.4. Mileage: received 39kmpl for 2 tanks and average till now is 37-40.  I think it is awesome considering the performance.Neutral: vibrations post 7k. Slightly annoying but not horrible. Bad things:1. Gear shifting:  same as gixxer and not a good experience.2. Windscreen: at 100-110 bike is rock stable but you aren't because of opposing wind you get.3. Dual muffler:  better on gixxer. This rectangle-ish design just sucks. Not a deal-breaker though.",Suzuki
"Pros:This is the best city bike in the 250cc segment. Extremely fun to ride if you like speed and acceleration. Good braking, abs. Try using nitrogen in both tires, castrol/motul/ecstar engine oil (every 6 months of service), and speed 97 fuel -  it is clearly the fastest vehicle on the road! (given there are no ktms around). Can easily reach 150 kmph on highways. Long rides >300 kms are enjoyable but can give you backache if your posture is incorrect. The design is very sporty and eye-catching, other commuters will admire your bike on the road and at traffic signals and ask about the model and price.Cons: Gear shifting is slightly hard. Quickshifting can be a great addition in the future.",Suzuki
"The motorcycle was good for around 3500km,no issues faced upto this range and completed the 1st service at 800km. After 3500km near to the 2nd service time got oil leaking from the engine head and 1st gear become noisy(neutral to 1st).About this time i went to the service centre for 2nd service of this motorcycle and addressed these issues with them,they take 2 days for the servicing.Changed engine head gasket under company warranty(only ridden 3500km).After the servicing the gearing noise  became less for just 1 day and the gearing issue came back ,this time with bigger problem.The gearing 1st,2nd and 3rd gear shifting become noisy,hard and clunky ,several times I had  got false gearing.Went to service centre,but they had no idea why this noise is coming and they take some phone calls and share some of gearing noise videos to someone from the suzuki, but nothing helps to solve this issue.And they send the motorcycle without clearing the issue and told me that they send some photos and video clips to Suzuki India for this issue and they will replay once they find the solution,They are told me that this the first bike to reported with these issue.......!!!",Suzuki
"I have purchased this bike in oct 2019. My buying experience with the dealers was fine. The bike has a stunning look and i was reviewing this bike on youtube and decided to invest money on this bike. The bike was fine up until the first service and then i started facing issues with the bike when crossed 3000 kms. Oil leakage on the head gear slips between 1, 2, 3 gears, false neutral and many more.... The head gasket was changed twice and still, the oil leakage issue was not fixed. I have launched a complaint on the same with the service point and no one seems to know how to service this bike as well. I have tried multiple service stations and end up with similar responses which turn out to be negative. At this moment the bike is new and the warranty is covered. Once the warranty is complete, all of these to be serviced would incur a charge and repetitive issues would also add to dissatisfaction. Personally, the looks of the bike alone do not provide satisfaction to anyone. The performance front needs to be taken into consideration if we need to evaluate the bike as a whole. I have stopped using the bike as i have started becoming depressed day by day. There are too many thoughts flowing around and less time to write, but for good, this is a buyer's cry.I have already started wondering if i have made the right choice buying suzuki gixxer 250. I would personally not recommend this bike to anyone.",Suzuki
"1. buying experience here in Bangalore is pretty good . Though i had to wait a long for getting the number plates .2. Riding experience is quite well . I owned a Gixxer Sf before and I feel same while driving it in city . I am yet to take it out on tour . The riding quality is good with decent pick up . I found lot of vibrations till the first servicing .3. Looks is great though I liked the old big head light model from last Sf model . Headlight is good . Suzuki should have provided more details on the meter . Like Mileage details , speed details . 4. Servicing is ok . Not great and not bad . They charge for everything in the free service , and your amount will come around 1k, for free servicing.5. Pros - stylish , superb performance .Cons - Vibrations other than that its superb bike to enjoy .",Suzuki
First of all i loved its design and style It has a good mileage within 250cc engine. It gives a good price rate among this ranges of bikes. Only i didn't like is the normal indicators i think it should be given led But it is not a point that one should be disappointed  but over it is a cool bike to buy.,Suzuki
"One of the best among its segment. I really liked the new design of the bike it's very eye catchy. Price is worthy . Comes in 3 colours. Another great thing is the mileage, 38.5 kmpl of mileage on a 250cc engine is rare to see. The built quality is good, parts are affordable. It's a suzuki so the maintenance and service will not pressurize your pocket. Great power power and torque. The only bad thing i according to me is the windshield, it's very small and can't protect you above 110 kmph but you can have an aftermarket windshield as well. Good for touring , you can easily tour at a speed of 120-130 kmph , no vibrations at all. Comfortable for city ride as well. Gets good handling, you can even do some track rides with some modifications on.Overall great value for money bike. Recommended as an upgrade from 100 or 150 cc or can be even used as a beginning motorcycle.",Suzuki
This bike is reasonable prize others bike. It is so comfortable riding. So sporty bike and mileageble. Less servicing and maintenance Pros is bike overall looking sporty but cons is  issue chain and breaks and also one of the most disadvantage in this bike pickup this bike pickup is not good this price.,Suzuki
"Worth money! Best bike in this price. 250 cc oil cooled engine is so smooth. design looks  great, best comfort, smooth handling, great power output, No vibration at all, Very good in this class. Only one thing negative is its windscreen.",Suzuki

"Buying experience was good. Saptagiri Showroom , dasarahalli in Bangalore supported right from loan application to delivery. Riding experience was too good as I used pulsar earlier which wasn't very refined.Looks are subjective ,I liked it and bought silver/blue color.Seating posture felt aggressive in the first week. But later got adjusted to it and feels comfortable now.",Suzuki
"Wonderful buying experience. Awesome bike with great looks, refined engine, safe and comfortable riding, good mileage of 33kms (plus) per ltr if maintained properly & taken good care like timely servicing, chain lubrication every 500kms, proper air in both tyres. The Centre stand was missing I get it fixed from the authorised service centre sagar suzuki. One more suggestion to all brothers keeps extra safety lock wherever you parked your gixxer SF250 as it's an eye catchy bike which attracts everyone including thieves. So extra safety locks are a must in both discs.",Suzuki
Smart looking/comfortable seating position/super braking with abs/average mileage/powerful machine. Display/ headlight focus/ good build quality/better performance in minimum service cost/steeper suspension more durability/wide angle oil cooling system. Value for money in this budget.,Suzuki
Its a budget bike as compare to other with the legendary gsx engine it is having a softer seat and a right posture and better handling. As it is mostly covered with fiber frames so in off road the performance goes down and looks are as similar the legendary gsx 750r although it would give you a better performance without servicing of 3 months but a fairing goes on lose and make a terrible noise after a long term use.,Suzuki
"Most people have really missed this bike, it is the only bike for highway, city, village, mileage is excellent, looks attractive, speed is like wind if you give a challenge you can beat any of the car.  crazy racing, when you sit on the bike so it feels like going on a long ride, the bike was specially made for travel.",Suzuki
"Buying experience -I had purchased this bike from Natwest Suzuki, Chennai on 8-7-23. The process was long as the approval for BS 6 II was pending at the time I booked. The owner himself was very helpful and entire registration and other process took 10 daysRiding experience - I have covered 350 kms in 10 days, mostly daily commute. So far so good. Handling is excellentPerformance and looks - Performance is awesome, this quarter litre motor pulls nicely to triple digit speeds and is butter smooth at 80-90 kmph range. No lags or struggle, the engine is smooth at 30 kmph even in 5th gear. Look wise I feel front visor is smaller and makes bike look childish.Pros - 1. Powerful engine2. Decent mileage3. No back/wrist/shoulder pain for a sports bike4. Pillion seat is comfortable compared to rivals5. LED headlamps are awesome6. Bluetooth connectivity is superb7. No vibrations and super stableCons - 1. Smaller front visor2. Some sound can be heard from exhaust tip due to vibrations during hard accleration as it is not fitted perfectlyUpgraded from pulsar 220f and is worth every time I ride",Suzuki
"I don't have this bike, but i know everything about this bike,That feeling was very awesome when i first rode this bike, the sound of its pickup is very awesome, this bike run like whole butter, awesome riding experience which i will never forgetIt's look so much awesome like the beast of the road,Cleaning the bike per month, changing oil every 2000 km , and safe drive 1)riding position - the gixxer hands down has one of the best riding positions out there in the market. It does not only give a sporty feeling but also is very comfortable as well. The sorted ergonomics mean that all types of riding can be done easily on the bike. Be it just normal cruising or even some aggressive runs as well.2)although the suzuki gixxer sf 250 may look sporty, it is quite a comfortable bike to ride. The clip-on handlebars are raised, so the rider doesn’t have to crouch low while riding. Also, the foot pegs are positioned in a neutral manner, which means the riding position is slightly sporty yet comfortable, ensuring that long hours on the gixxer sf 250 isn’t as tiring as one would expect. Swing a leg over the saddle and you won’t find the 800mm seat height too tall. While it is the tallest in its segment, even 5’6’’ rider can easily flat foot the bike.",Suzuki
Best fairing bike at this price range and you can use this as your daily commuter and especially I feel good with the pillion as my mom can sit comfortably.Low maintenance and you will get better mileage on highways like long rides you will get easily 35kms  and you can rev upto 140 km/h without any vibrations.Now I feel much better by not opting RC200 over this.,Suzuki
"Buying experience were good, exchanged fz16. Riding experience is very good, I need more experience in gear shifting, good fuel efficiency around 40kmpl in usual riding 40 to 80 km/h. Very good performance, but need to clean and lube drive chain  in every 1000 km's to maintain the  smooth riding, I don't do it within 1500 km's, feel some tightness.  Careful about mirrors in traffic. Rear brake punchy, may be it is designed  as to ensure safety in slippery roads. I can overtake any vehicles in 50 -60 speed as it provides good power but only I am worried about the non availability of central stand and good saree guard. Very good head light. After sales service is good.",Suzuki
"1. 6 Month i was only watching review of bike and in this segment no any bike in comparison of gixxer 250 sf , its my favourite bike to buy..ride quality is awesome of this bike no more vibrations will disturb you when you ride, looks stunning,1st service charge only Rs.750...if you want a good sport tourer then buy it....",Suzuki
"I was thinking of buying the naked version,but i bought the sf 250. Best bike in its segment, the cooling system is perfect and there is no lose of power. The rider peg's bit low,it can touch the ground in corners. It's scream in high rpm is awesome!!!also it's handling is perfect above all else. I have been using it for two long rides and going to college.",Suzuki
"Suzuki gixxer 250 is actually one of the fully packed bike in this price range. On comparing with it's opponents cbr250 and ktm rc 200, the bike overall in between them. It is better than rc 200. Almost similar to cbr. But lacks the top performance when compared to cbr, mainly because of lack of wind protection. Feature wise, gixxer is much better than the cbr. As a city motorcycle and for daily usage, gixxer is the best in this class. It is very punchy, refined, sporty as well as comfort, and fuel efficient also.",Suzuki
More than satisfied with the gixxer sf 250 as i was the first one to get this bike in indore and the performance of the bike is to good an its pleasure to ride this beast in city as it is having a eye catchy looks and super comfortable posture. Mileage is around 35-40kmpl in city and my mom also feels comfortable as a pillion.,Suzuki
Great looking design and so comfortable to ride and good riding options and its feel like riding a super bike feel. The head light get more attraction from other bikes and the design also unique the split seat is so comfort . The bike can use for regular and sports purpose also the silver colour is gorgeous. The black colour feels amazing.,Suzuki
"I had the experience of joining my friend while he was getting his first sportsbike. He trusted me to ride it to home as he has a phobia of riding new bikes.Truly speaking, the first look didn't impress me as i am an avid re lover. But the moment, they turned the ignition on, i was flattered.The looks and styling forced me to change my mind to invest my money into this next time i go for a two wheeler.I rode it back and man, how do i explain how smooth it was. I was riding at 30kmph with the 4th gear engaged and there wasn't any hassle. It was smooth as butter. The suspension is so good and that even the roughest of the patches on our road was easy to us. Ride quality is too good if you ask this former re lover. The braking was excellent while engaging abs. We got to test it in rains.Pros:1. Styling 2. Ride quality 3. Handling 4. Suspension (even the pillion rider was comfortable)Cons: 1. The horn (it sounds like a scooty)Overall, this is a great sports bike for beginners. Don't compare it with ktm in terms of speed. Ktm is faster. But again, you don't get enough place in India to race.I am betting my money for this surely next time.",Suzuki
"I bought the bike on June and I have ridden it for 1100 kms and the beast completed its first service and overall the engine is very smooth and the riding position is very comfortable and I went for a long ride for about 200 kms and its performance is amazing and in the midrange the power delivery is awesome, we can ride in the city very comfortably because the handling is good the only con about the bike is above 140 kms the wind blast is heavy.",Suzuki
"On-road price in bengaluru is around 2.19 lakhs . Till now i’ve clocked 600kms on odo ( and will try to update the review soon after first service ) . Firstly , the thing which you notice about this bike is the looks, it looks kinda cool and has a bigger bike feel when viewed from the sides but looks smaller from front. The riding posture , if you have ridden gixxer sf 155 , you’ll feel at home on this bike too, but you need to stretch your arms a little bit to reach the clip ons. Seats are soft and broad . Pillion seat is also soft , but you may feel difficult to hop on and off the bike . The instrument cluster , though smaller in size shows all the info except for average fuel consumption. Riding experience, in city the bike feels powerful , you will notice that the torque and power starts kicking at just about 3000 rpm. As the bike is still in break in period , i’ve taken the bike till 100kmph very gradually once or twice. The power keeps building till 9000 rpm, and getting a speeds of 100-110 is very easy . Brakes , front break is quite good i can’t tell they are the best , rear brake lacks bite . Vibrations are there in the higher rpms ( i’m expecting the vibrations to go after first service is done ) . The engine feels really smooth , this is the first feature you’ll notice once you rev the bike . The headlights being an all led setup , the throw of light is very good and you can ride all night with at most confidence. The cooling system , oil cooling is doing its job , even once i didn't feel the heat near my calfs in bumper to bumper traffic in bengaluru. The only thing which disappoints me is the length of the windscreen ( suzuki wanted to carry on the katana legacy ) , i will be upgrading the windscreen asap. Build quality and paint , both are brilliant and no complaints whatsoever.",Suzuki
I really thought suzuki will bring out another gimmicky bike. The bike looks very well put together and looks right from any angle.The bike feels very light and after testing out other 250s i can safely say that this bike is super refined.The price is justified i feel. The gearshift is not the smoothest but it's just right. All in all a very good prospect.,Suzuki

"                            The damaged vehicle is given by the dealer. At the time of possession, we showed more than 3 damages on the part to the salesman.Then he replaced it. Within one week we found the engine problem. Engin stopped during running and starting issues. The dealer salesman told us - it is due to dust on the sensor. Disappointed with dealer service and tvs quality.                        ",TVS
"                            1. The buy experience was so good from tvs dealers2. Riding experience I have noticed that the engine is limited3. Superb looks, performance good it can operate well for 0-70 kmph4. Service not up to the mark5. Cons: no Bluetooth for this price, fit and finish could be better.6. Excellent suspension and seating comfort7. Even on bad roads it can handle well.                        ",TVS
"                            There is starting issue, self start doesn't work properly, milage is also poor approximately 30 kmpl, I will not recommend this bike to anyone, I am from town Madhogarh UP, people also doesn't resolve my issue now what I have to do with TVS, middle light with! Symbol permanently on, very disappointed with self-start.                        ",TVS
                            Worst riding experience. A lot of vibrations after 2 weeks of use. When you ride the bike slowly you will feel the vibration very badly and when you write fast you will not even feel it. I visited the service center two times and reported this issue but not yet been fixed. So I don't recommend this vehicle to anyone.                        ,TVS
"                            The jupiter 125 I bought didn't work on self-start for 3 days. The service replaced the battery now and said that the dealer gave you old stock. I wouldn't recommend buying Jupiter 125 as it's not worth it. Has issues like alignment, starter, braking, low average, side stand forwardly placed etc. The intelligo & side stand alarm feature are actually a disadvantage.                        ",TVS
"                            Past six months till date I bought a new vehicle that is tvs jupiter 125 bs6 one of the trusted bikes of the year but that trust is melting from my side because as my prediction jupiter 125 is the worst bike of this year and the future too for the reason my bike is putting me in trouble since my purchase after every 2 months the accelerator cable is cutting off so it is very irritating for me I cannot my drive my vehicle comfortably because of this reason after telling this issue so many time to the service center they just neglecting my problem. Also, my bike is under warranty but during this period I replaced my acceleration cable 4 times as its cable quality is very delicate.  So I don't know if this problem coming to my crisis or any other casualties who are fans of this bike. Also coming to its suspension is very weak and indeed not giving you comfortable driving which impacts your body.  I'm not giving you a bad remark about the vehicle but from my side just sharing a serious problem this certain which the tvs manufacturing team has to look at this particular problem so it won't happen for future buyers thank you.                        ",TVS
"                            Service is not good, insurance claim is too bad less I have claimed insurance they have billed more than the cost. I recomend Access 2 wheelers. I have purchased this tvs jupiter 125 for more boot space and good design ,but performance is very bad.i really don't like this model ,even tyres are more skiddy.                        ",TVS
"                            Worst ever, my activa 110 is better than this shitty 125 jupiter. I purchased jupiter 125 on Feb '22 this year, and within 9 months it started giving issues like mileage for eg. In full tank only 3 days. Self-start stopped working. It had some error 300, something we had to kick start it every day for work. Now even after kicking it doesn't start sometimes after 5 kicks it starts or else it doesn't.....Feels like put petrol and burning this bloody scooty. Money wasted.Service center staff should be taught how to talk with customers, they really don't know how to talk and the second thing they really don't know what's the issue in scooty. They are just ready to blame us for not maintaining. My advice after experiencing this is that.....Will never recommend anyone to buy tvs vehicles that are because of their worst customer service.And poor vehicles which they launch. Especially this jupiter 125.                        ",TVS
                            It's the worst product in my life don't purchase the Tvs Jupiter 125 scooter worst spares and performance are not good its bad bad scooter worst products I'm totally hurt when I purchased this Tvs Jupiter 125 scooter don't purchase this scooter worst products I return to the showroom.                        ,TVS
"                            1.Buy experience was good. Because the showroom guy is my friend.2. Better riding experience. Very smooth, no noise, no vibration, good pickup. Great suspension, which I loved as I am a tall heavy guy.3. Great appearance. I liked4.Service is average. Service center guys just change the spare parts as you say there is some problem.5. Pros: Looks, smooth suspension, huge storage space, big seat, very quiet engine.Cons: Average mileage around 40, it's a bit expensive, service not happy.",TVS
"                            Worst decision in my life. TVS fooled us with new features and all.Petrol filling is hectic. Every time we cannot fill completely, the auto cut won't work at the petrol pump.Suspension is bad.The engine is the worst. Before I own a 110cc Jupiter. It is far far better in pickup and mileage.35 to 40 mileage is the maximum.Auto start and stop are not the best ones. Overall I don't recommend this bike.                        ",TVS
"                            A keyhole illumination sticker & keyhole shutter lock may be given boot light is not available anywhere I suppose unless otherwise very nice scooter esp the headlight, smoothness, and suspension front fuel tank is good since the rider can fill the petrol sitting on the seat. Pass light is very much useful to illuminate just like a flashlight.                        ",TVS
                            Customer satisfaction and there are an ample number of models available then the sales team was providing me with test drives and good technology then the engine warranty give me 5 years and another company provided an engine warranty is 3 years. Its very biggest thinking and labor services are a free good experience all things.                        ,TVS
"                            After a lot of research for 1 month, I finally bought jupiter 125 white variant alloy wheels in December 22 for rs.1.22 lakhs on road. The showroom person provided all the required info. The engine is smooth...Self starts very well even if not used for 2-3 days. I very much liked the seat underneath space ...I keep my office files easily ...I use them only for local city rounds... On average I got 48 kmpl after 2 months of riding. Total 500 km run. It's beautiful. Best for city rounds. With good suspension.                        ",TVS
"                            Riding experience is very worst, vehicle vibrating a lot, engine sound is pathetic, self start problem comes often,The worst part is if the electric start doesn't work then can't start with a kick..Keep your vehicle on side of the road..And take care of it until service people come and take it.And service people will come after 3 days to take vehicle so in case anything happened to vehicle customer have to bear loose..

"                            Worst scooter, a waste of money, bought a Jupiter 125cc last week. Facing problem in battery, lock opening. My only suggestion is not to buy Jupiter 125 cc. If the engine is showing problems within a week, how can I trust it for a long ride? If anyone still wants to buy it, it's up to them. My only suggestion is that Jupiter 125cc is just a waste of money.                        ",TVS
                            Very very worst vehicle I have seen I already had my hero honda pleasure now I got this tvs jupiter 125 disc brake bike last week from the beginning the petrol filling this problematic lady can't wear this problem but I am a working woman whenever I go to the bunk petrol filling is a big issue and the service is very worst.                        ,TVS
"                            The TVS Jupiter 125 is a scooter that offers a comfortable ride with a powerful 125cc engine. The scooter has a sleek design with a stylish front apron, chrome highlights, and a dual-tone seat. The scooter's handlebar is placed in an upright position, making it easy to manoeuvre in traffic.One of the most notable features of the TVS Jupiter 125 is its advanced technology. The scooter is equipped with a digital console that displays information such as speed, fuel level, and service reminders. It also has an external fuel filler cap that makes it convenient to refill the tank without having to dismount from the scooter.Another impressive feature of the TVS Jupiter 125 is its telescopic front suspension, which provides a smooth ride even on bumpy roads. The scooter also has a gas-filled rear shock absorber that further enhances the ride quality.                        ",TVS
                            The buying experience is good its looks is amazing riding experience is also good but there is a problem in the cluster always sign is blinking talking about the service center TVS Alibagh is the worst service center there are not able to solve the problem they create a problem in the vehicle when I go for first service there is no sign mark on the cluster when we receive the bike there is a sign I ask him there is service advisor Tejas he told sir it come and go no problem so please don't buy a vehicle from TVS Alibagh center.                        ,TVS
                            I like its look and features and I like its seat. The company gives me the best offer and the company give accesories with a scooter and get 1 helmet which gives the best protection.It gives mileage up to 57.6 on highways and in the city it gives 53.5 and I fell the full tank and it goes 200km. L like it so much you can buy it.                        ,TVS
                            This is the worst experience of our life driving this vehicle or you could call it waste. Because it doesn't give any mileage company claimed 60 kmph but it only gave 30 which is very disappointing.  Kickstart also losses its rebound. And there is a battery problem. There is no avaibality of parts . Odometer is not the greatest and most accurate. We cannot repair or solve our problem with other mechanics or else insurance will get cut. And overall this is a waste box of rupees 1.10 lakhs. And activa is good than this jupiter.                        ,TVS
"                            Mazor fact is a total waste of money, The braking system failed and the same clutch systemThe minor fact Fuel tank is very small. Poor pickup, after 15 days needs to clean clutch.Avoid this scooter and a zero rating to the service centre failed in this problem this is a defective scooter in the market so please do not waste your 1 lakh rupees.                        ",TVS
"                            1. Buying experience is good mcr tvs was specially ordered in titanium grey on my request. 2. Riding experience: it revs upto 90 kmph that's good for non-racing dna scooters. Braking is superb in this segment, no other scooter has near also. (activa 125 & access 125,burgmen 125 ). The motor doesn't seem punchy but did the job great.  You can adjust to your driving style by looking into instant fuel efficiency in the meter console, a great feature indeed. Avg fuel efficiency also lets you know about the actual fuel efficiency your scooter is giving you on basis of your riding style. 3. Looks: best looking in terms of design: diamond cut alloys, front drl integrated with indicators seems great at night time. Headlight & rear light are beautifully designed to serve the purpose. Chrome finish I liked most. Dimensions of the scooter also add great appealing in terms of road presence. Performance: acceptable even I ride in aggressive, slow and medium conditions scooter will never disappoint you. If you are expecting ntorq like performance it will stay true 80 percent. But its fuel injection isn't race tuned so expecting this kind of performance will be not true to its character design. 4. Servicing & maintenance:Very cheap to maintain not even rs 1600 spent a whole year. Replacement of oil & filter is also not required due to bs6 fuel injection tech. Though maintaining bs4 was a bit comparatively expensive. Service experience is good, not great as the number of vehicles getting serviced are always greater than you think so turn around time is a bit higher. Tvs need to look at how this can be improved further. 5. Pros :    design is great for the commuting segment.     (drls, headlight, backlight )    ergonomics are also great you don't feel pressurized in hand & torso portions. Braking superb ( disc variant) . The side stand engine kill switch is great. Both wheel sizes same so tyres can be interchanged, also bigger than other scooters so great for potholes. The front glove box with a charger socket adds practicality. I never use a power bank because of this. The front fuel lid also adds practicality. Intelligo: turning off 10 secs idling. Silent start: great feature. Brake lock also helps at inclined surfaces. (nearLeft lever ). Boot space to fit two middle-size helmets & cargo if you want. ( the deciding factor for buying without riding). Cons :Fuel tank size 5.1 liters smaller than other segment scooters. Fuel spilling sometimes happens when you are not aware of how much fuel can be added to the fuel tank so I recommend only 2.5 liters after your fuel light shows up. It works perfectly. The meter console seems a bit disappointing at this price point. Full digital meters can be integrated like Jupiter 109 cc top variants. The alarm of the side stand was found a bit irritating but it's a feature to never forget the side stand.                        ",TVS
"                            Amazing scooty Jupiter 125 disc Good looking and has an amazing comfort variant to a long ride, performance is very good.  stylish looks and no worry about maintenance andSo many features to feel a smooth ride thanks to tvs I recommend to others to purchase this variant Good and big boot space and other features.                        ",TVS
                            The buying experience was great. Got the scooter on 1st day Power is right on spot even with a pillion. The looks are stunning the front Drls and the diamond-cut alloy wheels make the scooter look superb and the seat is also very long 2 riders can ride very comfortably. Braking is very good And the suspension is a bit on the stiffer side but makes confidence at higher speeds. The boot space is the largest in a segment you won't find any scooter that has such boot space. Servicing is ok Maintenance is also ok                        ,TVS
"                            I'm sorry that the tvs jupiter 125cc is an absolute nightmare of a vehicle. It's a complete waste of money, and I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy.The problems with this vehicle are endless. Every month, there's a new issue that needs to be fixed, and it's just one thing after another. And the worst part is, the vehicle doesn't even start at all sometimes, leaving you stranded and late for your appointments.The customer service is best, tvs vasai branch but the product itself is worst then we cannot blame the service center. When I try to reach out to the customer service team, you're met with responsive and helpful representatives who seem to have an interest in solving your issues. Still, the vehicle I have got has a manufacturing defect I think. In short, do yourself a favor and avoid the tvs jupiter 125cc at all costs. It's an absolute disaster for a vehicle, and you'll regret buying it the moment you drive it off the lot.                        ",TVS
"                            Using it for daily use. everything is good but the battery is so weak I had to change the battery just within two months and no clicker which is a downfall. weight management is not so good feels so light when driving with people around ninety KGs. So overall it's good when it comes to a smooth ride. Can't really depend on this bike but when a new battery is on it, it's a pure family ride for sure.                        ",TVS

"                            If you start reading read till end..It's one of the best 125cc scooters in it's segment. If you want a scooter that can do daily commute and also for carry house hold things, you can  go buy this scooter eyes closed. It has very comfortable seat and also the material used in the seats are also of very high quality. It's suspension is so smooth It's design is carry forwarded by jupiter 110. But from far it gives a glimpse of Activa 125 (for me). Performance is very good , not less and not high by its competitors.""people say tvs service is not good"" but it's not true not all 5 fingers are equal, like that not every service center is bad .I have very good service experience. Don't listen to people.Prose: biggest storage capacity and foot space. Longest and widest seat.Cons: design flaw , while putting stand down. Not much colour available. Plain colour scheme.                        ",TVS
                            Best suspension and awesome ride quality. And it’s better than acess125 and activa125. Best in class.                        ,TVS
"                            Finally I made a good decision once again to buy tvs jupiter 125. I am a retired banker looking for a new bike for myself. ""kam peeta hai"" line of television ads was a trigger for choosing tvs over others. Showroom manager convinced me to choose the newly launched jupiter 125 as it has more advanced technology and features.Jupiter 125 only looks heavy but actually it's a light weight scooter. Half of the body is made of plastic while the front wheel guard, sides of the body panel which may get direct impact are metallic. It may be a cost cutting technique but it's fine. Design is classic. Riding experience is very smooth and there is no vibration even at 60 km/h of speed. Weight is evenly distributed and it helps in cornering without moving my foot to the ground. Acceleration, pickup, braking and overall performance are literally up to the mark. Seat and suspensions are decent. Mobile charging socket is also there but what really matters for me is a big storage under the seat which is very useful. Buying fresh vegetables and fruits daily is my habit and carrying those on boot in between the legs feels a bit uncomfortable and unsafe as legs are widely opened in that case.Tvs is a very popular brand nowadays like Bajaj or hero. Availability of parts and service couldn't be a deal breaker.Pros:(1) shifting fuel intake to the front manages twice the storage under the seat.(2) city mileage is more than 50 km/l.(3) light weight of the scooter makes handling very easy.(4) down stand alarm is a life saver.Cons:(1) fuel tank is underneath the floor. So, i used to be cautious on rough roads with irregular bumps.Finally, if you want to experience light and smooth rides on a budget then definitely go for it.                        ",TVS
"                            Buying experience is good. Scooty runs smoothly.

After more than a month, no delivery date provided. Since i needed one as early as possible, emailed customer support to cancel order a week back. Still waiting for a reply and refund from their support team.                        ",TVS
"                            Everything was fabulous and outstanding about this scooter right from the purchase process to the driving experience which was amazing. Tvs matrix motors, Mira road staff was very very cooperative at every stage of the the purchase process. The handling of the scooter is simply amazing and it zips across in all traffic situations. The two best features are the 33 litre under seat storage and the intelligo automatic stop and start system which enhances the scooters mileage much more than expected. The distance to empty feature is also amazing. The low battery indicator is important as the scooter does not have a kick start system at all which was very surprising for me as this is the first scooter with out a kick start mechanism. Another feature of the tvs scooters is that the odometer is linked to the rear wheel instead of the front wheel which increases the odometer of the scooter even if the scooter is parked on the main stand and accelerated in place which is actually a strange feature which again is a first for me. Overall this scooter is on a rating of 4.5 and the point 5 is only for the missing kick start and the rear wheel odometer system. Thank you for reading my review so patiently. Stay safe, wear your mask and take care. Thank you.                        ",TVS

Features like 2 helmet holder and fuel tank is near where we keep our legs and the scooty's twin bar holder and a usb charging port. Tvs has done a great job of the the legend.

"                            I shuffled from too many 2 wheelers (apache 200 4v, tvs ntorq, tvs raider & royal enfield classic 350) and finally bought this tvs jupiter 125 (top model disc + diamond cut alloys).1. Buying experience: i had a quotation a day before purchase with dealership. Removed unnecessary charges from the price breakdown. Bought in 97000/- in case from S.K. Tvs (Tilak Nagar, Delhi). The day of purchase my scooter was ready to run in less then 30 minutes. So, my buying experience was not bad.2. Riding experience: I had pulsar 180 before this so, this was the first time i was buying a scooter. After riding for a couple of days, I found that riding this scooter at a speed of below 50-60 km/h is pleasant. Feel like no hurry and start riding and you will enjoy this machine.3. Looks & performance: front looks of this scooter is average and rear look is good. Headlight performance is great and when you are standing on the red light then people see front fuel lid and look in your eyes with questions. Many time they asked me about the fuel lid and price of the scooter. Coming to the performance, this scooter won't allow you for sudden overtake in traffic situation. Scooter is very comfortable and practical and made for peaceful rides.4. Service & maintenance: My experience with service centre was neutral. Service centre guys were professional and they were doing their job in a way they are trained. Maintenance cost is not too much and you get 3 services free with this scooter.5. Pros and cons: Headlight performance is excellent. Boot space is outstanding. Front glove box is great to hold a beer bottle along with one pint.. Handling is awesome, feels totally in your control. Sbt breaking system is life-saver in sudden breaking situation. Diamond cut alloys are looks enhancer. Side-stand engine cut-off and beep is great safety feature. Meter console is very informative and bright. Wider seat is very comfortable and cushiony. I along with wife and daughter sits very comfortable on this.  Cons: Front look of this scooter is very average. Locking boot space is not friendly and need to push on the seat very hard to lock it. If your fuel tank is full then dte feature will not appear until your fuel meter is 2 bars down. Placing the scooter on center stand is little difficult. Grab handle reflector is just a reflecting sticker not a plastic reflector.                        ",TVS
"                            Buying experience was smooth. Bought it from a sub dealer.We bought this scooter after using activa for 6 years. Ride experience is good. Especially i like the suspension set up and bigger 12 inch tyres , they absorb bumps flawlessly.Look wise front facia looks great. And during night time i love the instrumental console. And seat is so big compared to it's rivals.I have not done first service yet so right now can't comment. Pros : 1 Bigger seat can accommodate 2 kids n two adults comfortably 2.Bigger boot space everyone will love it.3..Ride during bumpy roads is far better.4.Headlight visibility is awesome. We have pass switch also. 5. Fuel economy as per my calculations on tank to tank basis we are getting 53 km/litre.Instrumental console shows instantaneous fuel efficiency which can be easily used as guide to throttle inputs. Still i have not done first service.6.Inteligo feature is good to use in traffic.7. Ample legroom for the rider.8.With only one point operation for boot , fuel lid, engine kill, handle lock make it more convenient for users. 9.Fuel filling is in front that saves time and efforts on fuel stations.10.Less/no vibrations felt on handle bar.11. And main stand is so easy to use even my wife is parking it on main stand every day. And she is happy to do it again n again i was surprised with that. 12. Parking brake is so so easy to use that it kept me thinking how little things can make customers smile  and write longer reviews.13. Disc brake also gives extra safety.14. Materials used are also of good quality.Cons1. Limited colour choices and that too orange colour is not available easily. So choices between only grey and blue . Given the fact that ladies are also enjoying riding this scooter more colour options should be there.2. Showrooms doesn't have tvs jupiter 125 readily available but sub dealers are selling new fresh pieces everyday.                        ",TVS
"                            I decided to purchase the scooter only after reading Bikewale's review. Booked the top variant (grey) in march and got it after a month's waiting period as it was in high demand during that time. Currently(Aug) there's no waiting period.Overall experience is a 7/10. Have been using it for daily commutes around 35-40 kms every day and also a couple of short tours ranging 200-250 kms. One thing I can brag about is the smoothness in the 50-60kmph range. It's buttery smooth and feels like an ev sometimes. Coming to the looks, it's not a head turner but most people do appreciate the design language and the nice-looking alloys. Believe me, it carries a nice touch of premium-ness that is reflected in every bit of the scooter.Performance is commendable in this price range. Reaches 80 kmph easily and tops at 90. You can easily cruise in 60-70kmph range. You can also do 80 but there will be a sharp drop in fuel efficiency. With healthy speeds and proper tyre pressure, it can return a mileage of 51kmpl (max recorded by me). The average is 45-50kmpl.When you constantly ride it for say, more than 100 kms at speeds > 60kmph there is a drop in mileage. In one such situation, I got around 38kmpl. Otherwise, fuel efficiency figures are pretty good.Handling and shock absorption are where Jupiter 125 kills the competition its THE BEST in the segment according to me. It's fun to ride in cities and traffic. Gets adjustable shockers from Gabriel that does the job perfectly. The tyres are great and provide excellent grip in turns and rains. Even at higher speeds the scooter feels planted and you feel confident.The braking system is not the best but the disc at the front provides good bite and combo braking really helps.The headlights are pretty good. It has got nice DRLs in the back and front. The instrument cluster feels great and it's subjective in my opinion. The analogue digital combo is what I like more than the fully digital ones. Its digital unit is a bit small I can say but provides all required information. 2 trip meters and one trip F, Average and instantaneous fuel efficiency, distance to empty, all warnings like engine oil, low battery, side stand, service due, ISG and engine warnings etc.Coming to electronics it has got a side stand cut-off sensor and intelli-go which powers off the engine in halts.Maintenance and parts availability is never an issue with TVS. Just go through the manual book for more information about what's needed to be checked/changed during the respective service and confirm with the technician whether its done correctly or not.Brownie points for external fuel filler, external charging socket, storage area below the charging socket to put your phone/power bank, water bottle, glasses; large boot space and wide floorboard.Most convenient and practical family scooter.Pros and cons:Pros: Looks, Handling, suspension setup, featuresCons: There are some and I am not sure if I am the only person facing these.1. every day when I turn on the ignition and accelerate for the first time in the morning the scooter gets a lot of vibration in the rear and the handles. After riding it for a while, the vibrations disappear.2. Rear brakes lack the required bite. You have to depend on the disc a lot. 3. Front disc produces a lot of squeaking noises while riding during rain or on muddy patches. Have to clean the discs every morning with a clean cloth.4. Fuel efficiency could have been better.                        ",TVS

After 3rd service top speed is 82kmph and now it's my 6th service and full acceleration will not go beyond 78 kmph.3. Good looks for a family use scooter. Phone charger/holder, boot space, petrol filling point, and digital meters are all very helpful. Performance-wise it's not upto jupiter 110 cc. Because jupiter 110 cc easily gives 85 kmph speed even after a year.4. The 5 servicing completed was excellent. The tvs store (4 stores) haven't got the parts required for 6th service and hence have to wait for 2 weeks to receive the parts in their store.5. Overall good scooter with pretty good boot space, phone charger/holder, comfortable fuel filling, noiseless.Cons... If you ride at 80kmph the mileage drops below 25kmpl. If you need good mileage ride it in between 45 to 60 kmph.Max speed drops below 82 after 3rd service.

Base model has drum brake, next model has disk break and third model has disk break with further enhancement in feature like map assistant, premium seat with back support etc. So I'm a family person with Wife and 2 kids ( elder son is 5 years and second baby is 1 year) hence I was looking for a bike with wider seat, large boot storage, high weight bearing capacity, high mileage in nominal price, hence I prefered disk break TCS Jupiter 125.Features / Pros:As I mentioned in my previous note, It has below features1. Disk Break (Model based).2. Large Seat ( Even easy for a big family).3. Large Boot space ( 2 helmets with some items is possile to carry).4. Auto Mode On/Off Switch (Engine with auto off if the bike is not moving for more than 20 seconds. This is beneficial in Traffic to save Petrol). [There is a big catch in this point. Which I will highlight in Cons section]5. Hand Break (Much needed when we want to park the scooter in slanding paths)6. Helmet remainder while starting thne vehicle (Though it's just a static one, I appreciate).7. Side Stand Indicator.8. Engine Off when Side Stand is On. (I do have a Con here, we will discuss)9. Charging Port.10. Petrol Input is at front (So no need of getting down and opening the boot space like other old model scooters.)11. Clock Time.12. Eventhough we are having self start, there is a Kicker.13. Echo mode and Turbo Mode. (If we raise the accelaretor too much suddenly or Speed needle crossed 60KM/L, Turbo mode will ON. else it will be Echo mode).14. There is a Error Symbol in the screen which will ON if there are any error/backup recovery happening in the scooter. This is a much important feature out of all, since it will show light whenever motor things there is a error in the ISG / Powerbackup [Here also one catch, will discuss in the Con.]15. Low Petrol Indicator.16. It has been providing better mileage of ~56km/l.17. Cost of the bike is lower than any other bikes with 125CC.Cons:Out of the above feature, there are Cons as below1. Auto Mode On/OFF made my vehicle Off in Trafic but when I press the break and raise accelrator, igintion should On but in my case bike always went to Error Mode and due to that no other option was not working including strtaing the vehicle. Due to this I faced serious issue in main roads of Bangalore. This happened immediatetly once I the started raiding the vehicle. I informed the Showroom people / Service Guys but no one accepeted this. After a serious fight, they accepted that there is an issue in Jupiter 125 new models ISG, which made the vehicle to Error Mode !!!!!!I was shocked since it was a brand new vehicle and failure in ISG is a product bug. After I replaced ISG under Varenty and now it is working fine. So if any one is going to buy new Jupiter 125, please keep in mind as this problem is very random and you might also be one among them like me.2. Side Stand was not working within 2 weeks of Purchase:Side Stand was always on ON due to that engine was not started. Even we pushed it to up, it was going down automatically. It is also an issue with the quality of Jupiter 125 and I lost the confidence on the quality of TVS products nowadays.3. Eventhough I bought Disk Break model, breaks are working as Drum only. Even after 1st service still it is not upto the mark. Due to this break weakness, I met an Accident and my bike's front chrome and silver panel are broken. I didn't get parts easily from TVS and still one part is pending to repair due to the lack of pproduct at TVS.4. TVS Service:The service was very worst and they won't accept the issues that easily. They will try to convience you as much as possible and if you fight to the core and provided more and more proofs lively then they will accept and fix it. So they are able to fix the issues and accepting the issue is a real concern.5. When talking about Engine performance, Initially vehicle provided loud noise while driving. After first service, now the vehicle is smoother than before.These are my own experience and I'm not saying you will also face it but this is was happened to me.                        ",TVS
"                            I was buying this Scooter just for my friends to tell me, But now i feel this scooter is value for money for everything. So thank you so many Tvs for a good experience given to the middle-class people.I am recommending for all scooter lovers buy this scooter because it was worth comparing to other scooters.                        ",TVS
"                            Worst service, with in six month of new bike I got 3 major complaint, useless. Service side no support when needed, toll free number useless after 9 pm. Very low quality products are used, battery got failed in three month. Display not working properly                        ",TVS
"                            1. Buying experience: the buying experience was good, the salesperson allowed me to all available Jupiter 125 in the stockyard. 2. Riding experience: the scooter comes with 3-level adjustable suspension, I have ridden along various uneven and broken patches, the ride is pleasant and it has good pillion support. The start-stop system sometimes malfunctions and it can catch a traffic signal.3. Performance: I have not taken the speed beyond 60 km/hr but the engine is very refined though not very refined as Japanese. The scooter can easily climb the gradient with a pillion. Coming to the practicality part, the scooter is really ahead of its competitors offering the largest boot in its segment. I have never observed the petrol filling issue reported in other reviews. I would recommend never to tank full the scooter just for the safer side.4. Service: I have not serviced yet but in my previous experiences it is a hit or miss depending on the service station.5. Pros: practicality, dual trip meters, distance to empty, front fuel filling provision, an integrated key position for boot, fuel lid, and start-stop system, comes with a kick starter.6. Cons: sometimes felt refinement could have been a little better but in isolation, it is nicely refined.                        ",TVS
"                            Amazing scooter with great looks! just close your eyes and buy it. I am fully satisfied with all the parameters, looks, mileage, performance, suspension, everything is great! proud indian scooter which will satisfy you in every aspect! i will buy one more for my daughter now! i am so impressed about this vehicle! it's engine and suspensions are buttery smooth! kudos to tvs                        ",TVS
"                            I am overall satisfied with this scooter here r a few pros 1. Very good milage (after 2nd service it's giving 56-60 km)2. Very good headlight3. Smooth engine4. Largest under-seat storage! Best in the segment.5. Long n spacious seat6. Intelligo feature7. USB charging8. Very low service cost.Cons : No major cons only 1. Build quality could have been better.2. High beam is slightly focused on the right side, not in the center.                        ",TVS
"                            125 Jupiter has a vibration problem. Don't buy it I am struggling to solve this issue. They don't even know why it is vibrating. From day one it started vibrating. After 5 days I visited the workshop and they didn't solve it. I am still consulting with the technical team and doing my best to replace it. Just be careful, don't buy it without test driving it. There are many hidden issues in this.",TVS
"                            Is too good at this price point, my riding experience is good, I love the suspension and 12-inch rear front wheel. Is very comfortable for a family person who can carry lots of things.Some Cons of this scooter:1. Morning time when you start the scooter you can feel a vibration after a few kilometer running is ok.2. 35 to 40 mph you can feel vibration upper 45 kmph is ok. 3. the handle of the scooter is Moving And loose, Just because the company fitted 2 nuts they need to fit 4 nuts.                        ",TVS
                            Very good suspension Nice bike Looking niceI ride every day  for 300kmsNice colors and an attractive look Here is a great example of how any bike stable on highway driving A big wheelbase helps to avoid very very bad roads in city and rural areas of Maharashtra Design is also an important feature of tvs jupiter.Very nice.                        ,TVS
"                            I like this vehicle very much.  There are reasons behind it.  A good ride is comfortable, can travel long distances, and has good quality. Because we are worth the money we pay.  Tvs Jupiter is the best vehicle for that price.  Any road can be traveled very comfortably in this vehicle. So I would tell everyone to buy it.                        ",TVS
"                            Buying experience is 100% satisfied I bought this from golden tvs jagadgiri gutta.  First, I went to susheel tvs but the worst experience I have faced. I bought this scooter with a net amount.. Riding experience I love to ride jupiter. My first own scooter is also 110 cc jupiter so I'm very happy with the riding experience.Looks are quite similar with 125 activa but tvs created a good performance scooter.  Additional features also give happiness to customers. Servicing is also good but it depends on which showroom you visited. Pros Riding style and weights The engine cut off while standing on Idle start stop Dual helmet storage Front fuel tank. Cons Quite a noise Vibration on 80 speedInstrumental cluster ( fully digital is expected ) Under-seat storage light ( extra fitting and extra charge required ) Petrol tank ground clearance ( quite more height required ).                        ",TVS
                            Poor service network [ untrained technical staff ] service center staff seems like primary school kids. They enjoy wasting the time of consumers. Non-availability of spare parts. And the major thing is even they are not aware of there products related problems. So it's a very bad experience to own tvs brand.                        ,TVS
"                            We bought this bike in 2021 November and since then the bike has stopped working twice the first time it stopped was at verna highway. And now at home, it stopped suddenly service center has no reason why this is been happening again and again. I would not recommend this bike to anyone.The bad choice we have made.                        ",TVS
"                            1.Buying experience is good with trial tvs in Whitefield2. Riding is smooth and comfortable, suspension does magic3. Looks are subjective, for me it is excellent. Build quality is excellent. Headlight performance is awesome in night. 4. Not yet serviced. No comments",TVS

"                            As compared to 160 4v, The power terms and Outlook is quiet catchy but the lack of 6th gear and liquid cooled. But providing 19ps power that's make sense here. The maintenance is easier and the riding comfort is awesome. Best for daily commute and for long rides in this price segment.Value for money                        ",TVS
                            Price to specifications ratio is low Its too expensive compared to its competitorsI think either the price should be decreased or more features must be added One way the other can make the bike a perfect choice But specifically for me price should be decreased because in India there are few people who buy a bike over 1.5 lakh on road                        ,TVS
"                            As it's a limited edition model, so point in crying that it's overpriced. This is made only for collectors who want to own an unique motorcycle. In my opinion, TVS has done a good job in extracting 19bhp from a 165cc engine, very close figures To Rtr200. So, now stop complaining about it being overpriced and congrats TVS for doing something unique,  instead of changing sticker like Bajaj and other brands.                        ",TVS
                            Had the worst experience with tvs within 25000kmts big trouble with the engine waiting more than two months for spare parts tvs company not have any spare parts for this model even for a plastic spare I waited two and half months for the last service...Within one year that battery was dead... That bike's price is too high compared with other bikes I'm not feel anything new in that bike only colour and graphics are good..And the main thing tvs never listen to customers' complaints and you never get any response from tvs customer service...                        ,TVS

                            The bike have very smooth handling and it's look very amazing.I wish someone gift me this bike.This bike break control is very hard.And wheel is very aggressive. I wish that every morning the rr310. I don't know when i bought this. But i ride in 3 times. I said rr310 is to ready to challenge ktm 390.I suggest all of you please get a test drive.                        ,TVS
"                            Actually first i saw the bike in an auto show in an engineering college. It was placed with rc 390, ninja 300, ninja zx10r, and other bikes. The litre class machine zx10r is just one bike (ninja 300) ahead from the rr310. But i promise, the look from the front of the rr310 just pull me towards it. The led headlight design has given the bike killing look. It seems to be almost the same size of the zx10r. I was so excited by its look. On seeing the feature list, even ktm 390 doesn't match up with rr310, especially the new bs6 variant.The motorcycle i ridden was actually the bs4 variant, and that feel was just amazing. The feel given by the tank and entire cockpit is an unmatchable experience. It may have less power outputs with other 300cc bikes. But we wont feel much of a difference unless we rev it beyond 4k rpm. Ninja 300 and r3 are twin cylinder machines and their refinement is unmatchable. So the direct opponent is rc390. They are having price difference of about 15k only. Rc 390 is actually a pocket rocket. It is the best track bike under 5 lakhs. I have seen many who took rc 390/ rc 200 and sell it in one year. Thats because of the riders triangle and the seating posture of the bike. Riding an rc 390 along some bad roads for 10 minutes will tire you so much due to the stiff suspension and aggressive riding position. I have said these about the rc 390 because, these drawbacks are actually covered by the apache rr310. The rider can travel above 300 kms at single stretch. It is just a bit sporty than a cbr 250r. The bs4 machine i rode was having the vibrations once we touch 90+ kmph in 4th gear. But on 6th gear we can smoothly go till 120kmph on the bs4 version. The engine is refined. But the noise was from the fairing and vibes were also felt on the footpegs and handle. But think it was at high speeds. For a daily user it is not a problem. The happiest news is that tvs has solved the vibration issues in the new bs6 model.So the issue with the old model is gone.In my riding experience, rc 390 feels so small, hard, scary and aggressive. But apache rr310 is just comfortable sports bike. Those who are so much passionate about ktm can but rc just after a test ride. Ride according to your needs, if you are a city rider, ride it in city, if touring, then have a long ride before buying.Apache rr310 is overall the best package. In my experience, it has more build quality than rc and also have more refined engine. It is better looking motorcycle in 300cc segment. It is comfortable for a tall guy as well as short guys, fat guys as well as lean guys. The negative i felt in the motorcycle was the vibrations ( which is also present in the ktm ), are now solved i  the bs6 model. Also they included ride by wire technology, riding modes and many features, at current apache rr310 is worth buying at the 3 lakh price range.                        ",TVS
"                            Tvs apache 310rr bs-vi is the best beast out in the town.... It's one of its kind bike and India's own sports bike.... The first ride itself gave me the confidence of going for the right choice and one can easily feel the macho he's sitting on... The first comment i got was that i got an imported bike, until when my friends saw the tvs logo... The looks are dashing, feels like riding the ""dhoom"" bikes... The speedo cluster with connectivity, the sitting comfort, the engine sound, the balance of the bike, are more than enhancements to its macho look...And when it comes to ""swadeshi"", go for your own sports bike and serve your nation....

                            The buying experience of rr310  was awesome. I loved this bike alot. I think this real best edition of sport bike for best price and valued for it. I enjoying riding it. Looks are nice . Servicing is good and maintenance feel little heavy but not a big deal . Good mileage and the only disadvantage is the petrol tank should be given more bigger because for long rides and heavy race . Fuel will be less . That's all for it  . I suggest by friend's and people who is watching my review can have trust on what i am saying and get this bike .                        ,TVS
"                            For some of you, this bike cost must be high but let me assure you this is the best bike in 300cc segment. Let me tell you why 1. It is not too much overpowered it is enough to make your girlfriend go crazy .If you are a layman you might say i want only power. 2. It have features more than many 600 or 750 cc bikes and anyone and it have lots of information not just in tft display but if you connect it with your phone you will go crazy. It have even  more features than my car.                        ",TVS
"                            I had purchased  this bike and its the only bike which i love so much from hyosung, ninja 300, dominar this is the best bike i used ever at last i want to say if you are in search of 300cc bike then i will suggest you to purchase apache 310 rr because it gives good mileage good visual appearance and comfort than other bikes i used.

"                            Amazing bike! Great for daily use and the mileage that i for was 30-32kmpl in city usage (URBAN MODE)other than the price 2.40L alright it might be a bit pricy, it's totally worth the money with all the features it gives with.I chose this over the rc390 was due to everyday usage to go to college. Sure the rc390 is more powerful but the rr310 is an overall rounded bike.The only thing missing in this bike i would say is traction control. But i think TVS could implement it with an update because of the Ride by wire technology.                        ",TVS
                            Apache  rr 310 is best bike for all of us but bike is costly but 1 time you purchased you happy many years this bike is so awesome. Bike is great awesome  sexy look very nice bike for of all us i request to tvs company please apache rr 310 price deceased 1 lakhs 95 thousand is best .Over 2 lakhs is costly for middle class family for purchase a bike.                        ,TVS

"                            Bike is overall superb but only cool thing in this bike is its top speed, because if we race with even r15 v3 150cc bike goes 150 kmph and 312 cc bike goes 160 so that's not a difference even 18bhp bike can compete with your 34 bhp bike that's the thing i feel bad of rr310. That's very disappointing for me because i am a rush rider and i like to remain on top speed but this bike is not that good in power not most of tell about this but rush rider like me feels bad and my friend too feels bad about 300 cc bike and performance is like 180 cc bike.

"                            The bike is just amazing .It defines what it is ,, absolutely no doubt , basically its made for track purpose, even in long  rides the bike gives good support like narrow roads and corners, cumming to dash board the racing computer (display) is really superb in day and night ,it has lot many information's, even in bright sun the display is visible perfect,, navigation  buttons respond fast and superb, average millage in city ride about 32 to 34,whereas in highway ride about 37 to 39kmph,  in averages speed of 50 to 70kmph, this bs5 engine is really smooth and has  very less vibration and less noise.And cumming to pillion seat is just there design , in touring pillion cant sit for too long ,, its the pain in this bike ,and maintenance is not too cost but it is all about how you use it.According to me the only con is fuel tank capacity could be better(at least 14ltrs ) .. Worthy purchase ..Good luck ride safe..                        ",TVS

"                            Buying experience.It was great deal to look at buy at first had an amazing well trained staff , well knowledge about the bike at dealership.Riding experience.At first you'll get super excited to get hands on 310 cc bmw single cylinder machine. It's pickup and is comfortable in terms of riding position and suspension as of that in ktm rc series due its rigid suspension and aggressive sitting position that causes your back alot of problems.Looks of 310rr are 10 on 10 So far this is the best of bike as of mileage and its power ratio.Performance.City performance is a blast of this with superb breaking . And bike comes with abs as standard.One this that it lack is its top speed as an speed lover i tried it but did not go over 160km/hr.For a 310 cc bike that is considerably a no And with vibrations coming of it's heart at higher rpm's.It can be taken into account for long rides Service It first service will cost you around 600-700 without labour charges (that's pretty low) with change of engine oil and filter. And another add on of 600 after you have finished all you free services.Pros and cons. Pros1. Great seating positions and suspension 2. Good pickup 3 .Nice breaking and abs system 4. Good for long tours 5. Amazing looks 6. Low maintenance Cons1. Low on high way performance 2. Suspension need stiffness if your sole purpose is to race and bending on corners at high speed.3.

At the price range it gives me so much suspension while i riding.3. So much aggressive looks. It's performance is too good.4. It's not so hard to maintain this bike.

Better mileage, Price is good but if it was launched under 2.2 with on road price it would have been perfect choice in the market.Top speed is good not bad. Better quality components. Overall almost everything is good except few___: cons :Price as mentioned above for current specs, Or better power would have delivered as it was launched to beat the market of ktm,dominar,ninja with this price Some minor issues like vibration that decreases the interest as it looks super but vibrate this is quite not good. Better exhaust would have provided. Current exhaust don't match with the body neither sound nor look. Braking would have made better Or else everything is good according to me.

It's good for city ride and also for students it have good mileage, speed, looks and features Tvs had solved many problems like vibration by increasing the weight of the handle, and the chain roller they had replaced a smooth roller instead of old and the gear box is not so bad and they can improve more by adding slipper clutch........ In 2.5l it is one the best bike for daily use and long rides it's more comfortable and by bright light we can drive very safe during nights also.                        ",TVS

"                            I have observed reviews of rr 310 for almost an year & then took the plunge to get rr 310 a month ago.now i previously owned an rtr 160 for 10 years (earlier flagship of tvs a decade ago) & without even single breakdown, did all hilly terrain or highways upto 300 km a day on weekends. It never failed. Impressed by legacy of rr160, had plan to own rtr 200 (the couple of year old flagship), but then rr310 was declared, so it's a latest flagship of the company whose 10 year old product was doing wonders till now for me, add to that bmw engineering (big bonus) + extra 1.5 lacs worth investment in design , r & d per bike, 35 years of tvs experience, you are never going to get a product less than near perfect all rounder. I can drive it at 7-10 kmph in traffic, i can maneuver it at will (though it's big), it's shockers & ride quality is so plush, you feel pothole are half the actual size, it can overtake 99 % vehicle on road when you wish, & at each signal it's the best looking bike , arguably. Now mileage 30 kmpl without 1st service, when speed is 45-75 kmph, & when 70-110 kmph, mileage is 25 kmpl, over all 27 kmpl for initial 300 kms, not bad for a performance sports tourer, it can go slow, its sports bike yet comfortable, it's heavy not yet too heavy to take life out of you when pulling, it's forgiving, you make some silly mistake & it gives you chance to correct it, it won't afraid you, it's powerful but under your command. Balance. It looks suave not a hooligan , rides suave too, so it reflects your personality. There are 4 better performers at extra cost, but then the cost is whopping 1 lakh for ninja 300 & r3. Close rival in cost rc 390 is faster powerhouse but not comfortable, & tough to handle in slow traffic, then looks & feel wise rr 310 is winner for me. Dominar performs similar but doesn't look 75 % as premium as this though cost of dominar is less too. So rr 310 is in balance with dominar, rc/duke 390, ninja 300 & r3 on other ends due to cost, handling, performance, weight , mileage. Looks is where it outshines others & it matters when you are riding a 2 lakh bike & it pays too :) if you out & out fast rider go for duke 390/ rc 390 for little extra money, but comfort, mileage further goes down & chances of errors are less too for the power they offer for more refinement, you can go for ninja 300 & r3 by paying additional money- 1 lakh approx, they still don't look this great :). They perform better surely but then cost difference is huge. Rr 310 is adequately costly for the value all-rounder it brings for your money.                        ",TVS

I think this time tvs doing fantasy job. Eye catching bike and mind blowing feature in this bike. I booked this bike when i saw the video in bikewale.Com. Get ready for the pure race-craft experience. Request a call back. 35 years of experience. Unique design. Modern wind tunnel. Tvs apache rr 310 is based on the bmw g310 platform and sports a carbon-fiber body. The power unit that pumps life down the veins of this athletic sports tourer is the 313cc liquid-cooled single-cylinder unit that is engineered to yield a peak power value of 34ps at 9500rpm in collaboration with a peak torque of 28nm @ 7500rpm.,TVS
                            I am using this bike for the last 5 years.. When it came in  2017.. I got delivered this bike in the 2018 1st edition.. I was 2nd owner of this bike in my belgaum city.. After 3 free services.. The paid service is too much for this bike.. I do my service once in year fully.. Around 10k rupees for service.. The bike is sensitive.. It's only good for highways.. 1st 3 years I don't know my bike fuel was leaking.. I was just getting a mileage of 12 to 24.. When I gave my bike to service in kolhapur that time mechanic told me.. Fuel tank leaking is there.  So after completing tvs and waiting for 6 months to replace my bike fuel tank.. I bought my bike from there and down starting 4 services there they never told me.. My bike fuel tank was leaking.. And tvs service in belgaum goa.. Is worst never to buy tvs in this city.. Their service is slow and for parts to arrive takes centuries.. Only tvs vehicles are good.. Tvs give jobs to those who don't have knowledge about bikes.. Don't use mutual engine oil it gives below 30kmpl milage.. Only use fully synthetic oil for 310 rr it's gives under 40 kmpl.. Buying this bike is like buying 1st copy bmw.. Service cost almost same.. Don't see youtuber and get chutiya.. Ask real owners who owns this bike for last 4 to 5 years.. Then bike this bike.. Every time I need to travel 200 to 300 km for bike service..                        ,TVS
                            The bike is very good at looks ... And also it has good features likes tft display gtt technology and the great power it has good acceleration and some disadvantage are power to weight ratio is low and bad looks from exhaust note and power are great but comparing with this segment bike then it's low they should increase the power and some braking! brakes are good but there are many cases of brake failures add some more features like a quick shifter and ride by wire technology and auto Blippar.                        ,TVS
I don't know why should i buy this bike price is too high and low power.I have better option just pay few more amount and buy high power machine and that is ktm 390 this is best option for every thing.Tvs has 33 bhp and 27.30 nm and price is 2.40 lakh  approx.Ktm has 42.90 bhp and 37 nm and price is 2.66 lakh approx,TVS

Acceleration is pretty good and is a perfect   monster machine with a single cylinder reverse inclined engine. Only the thing which affect it's goodness is little vibrations. After-all it will be a better option to own .,TVS
"A good look with broad tires but it must have worked little bit on brake parts.. Abs might have been concentrated for sharp brakes.. The bike doesn’t stop quick when i go 70km in 1st gear.. But i love the engine and the bike lights. I can feel like am riding a ducati panigale, and the handlebar is like wide enough for me to bend over to catch the acceleration bar",TVS
It was my first time buying tvs company bikes. And believe me i am totally satisfied with this bike. Riding experience is super. Smooth riding and a controlled system. Looks i will give 9/10. Performance also 9/10.Maintenance is not more. It's depend on your riding style. Pros- awesome bike you can go easily 120km/hr without any worry. Style and comfort. Cons- i didn't find any cons yet. ,TVS

Compared to other bikes in this segment rr310 has a great seating comfort compared to any other faired bikes in the segment (rc390,ninja 300)and it's suitable for touring I've personally rode this bike for 250 km's non stop and I haven't felt any discomfort yes it's suitable for touring (but with practice (like first do short rides and then long)) and the maintenance is also very less compared to other bikes in this segment.  Cons: you can feel vibrations if you go over 125                        ",TVS

"                            The buying experience with TVS was not so good, the new bike with E20 fuel support is what I got, and the vibration was very low as compared to the old model that my friend owns. I loved the black-grey color combo. I generally use it to escape my weekday sorrows. Taking the sporty beast for a long highway tour. Really enjoying the smoothness. Love the sound. The mileage is great for a 312 cc engine. I was confused between this and the Triumph 400 or the Harley x440 but this is a good choice I made.                        ",TVS

Finally i'm very happy to lunches my favourite bike apache rtr 310 I don't know riding experience because this bike was launched todayBut i really love this bike I want this bikeFantastic mind-blowing in believable i have ever seen this kind of bike like any other bikeIt was looking awesome Finally i love tvs,TVS
Awesome bike no doubt about that .Tyre which is not good as metzeler on duke and rc. Michelin pilot street is for better practicality good for mileage and have dual compound construction 2 edges is soft compound  for sticky wet conditions for cornering grip and hard compound in the middle centre of the tyre for extra mileage and it's radial too !,TVS
"Super bike in this range, tvs really braked the heart of mine, i am very excited about its trial super look I never think about the average average also so good only 18 superIts a new vibration for the new biker to purchase the new version of apache This is brilliant and of-course super for those who is addict to ride good bikes on Indian road. Super look ",TVS
"                            I purchased bto edition. Got delivery in time. First thing i noticed is amazing build quality of this bike, same bike is also sold in bmw lineup as 310rr.The riding posture is very comfortable in the sports bike category. I rode it for continuous 6 hours with just 40 min break, and no pain anywhere, trick is to hold the tank with your thighs and posture change from time to time. Rode it at max 155kmph, it was surprisingly stable at that speed too. Getting mileage of 30kmpl on highways and 27 km in the city.It has 4 modes, one extreme is urban other is the track. If you compare these two modes, the engine suddenly gets more torque in lower revs in urban with an rpm limiter. In track, it revs hard with a load of torque at higher rpms. Brake behavior also changes in both modes.The windshield is very well designed, you can sit behind it all day with no air drag.                        ",TVS
"Super stylist very catchy on first look itself..!! the apache rr 310 uses the same liquid-cooled, 313cc single-cylinder engine as the bmw g310r. Design concept is admiring sharp and edgy design drawing inspiration from the body shape of sharks something that goes with cfd concepts. Not yet owned but willing to get one soon :)",TVS
"A perfect bike for everything!Well, this is the bike i was waiting for. Its good for daily usage, on-track and off-track!Not as powerful as ktm rc 390 but more comfortable than ktm rc 390.Has a better look than most available out there. You thing it is costly? check for tnt 250 or cbr 250 or ninja or any other 300 cc bike with this much good look!",TVS
"I like this bike,i am planning to purchase within a month. I love this bike i have seen in showroom it really amazing.Nice look while you going in streets every one will look at your bike that's for sure. I think red is great choice for all because looking so gorgeous i will buy this bike very soon in hyderabad",TVS
"The speed of bike is so good and it go 0-60 under 2.5 sec. The sound of exhaust is like monster sound . I suggest you that if you are buying a bike in range of 250-350 cc engine buy tvs apache 310 rr is a pretty good bike. The comfort of that bike is also good you cannot have to feel small breakers, etc .  The brakes are also good the speed goes down 60-0 in 3.8 sec. And it cannot sleeps tyre in any type of road .

"                            I have more than 5 years of riding experience. Looks very good and very power full bike and its performance is very dangerous.

"                            Its been almost 4 months and I have clocked almost 6K Kms. If you are planning to buy this bike, make sure that you take a test ride.PERFORMANCE Performance figures are kind off Ok, however, it has enough punch to keep you in the top of the line. Acceleration is linear and top speed is around 165. It will reach 150 pretty fast and then it will start climbing. We can comfortably cruise at around 120kmph. Never think about getting close to KTM 390, Ninja or an R3. Depending on the rider, it will manage to catch up with Dominar400MILEAGE Coming to mileage figures, in highways, I have managed to squeeze out something near 37 by doing 70-75kmph most of the time and being gentle with the throttle. Normal city riding will return around 28-30kmpl. If you push it really hard, you will end up in getting something near 25kmpl or even lesser. HEATINGThe heating is well-controlled, I haven't faced any serious heating issues till date. BREAKSComing to breaks, I will say that for this kind of performance, it's kind of average, both front and rear lack initial bite, the front break have decent progression and the rear break lacks progression as well. In simple words, we can say the rear break is kind of poor.BUILD QUALITY The Fit and finish of this bike is top notch. The bike itself feels very premium. We won't be able to see any panel gaps or rusting issues. Overall, it outshines every competitor in terms of quality.RIDE QUALITY & HANDLINGThis is where it feels the best. It's a great handler. In corners, straight lines, in very low speeds, it really holds the line very well. It seems to be heavy, and in the paper as well it weighs 174KG, but when you ride it, you feel like you are connected to this machine right from the go. Ride quality is good, it will absorb bumps and holes pretty decently, best in the segment for ride quality. Even the riding posture is comfortable once you get used to the riding triangle.MAINTANANCE Service cost is high compared to ktm and bajaj and yamaha. Still its managable. The service quality seems to be good but it varies according to the dealership. So if you have any plans to buy this machine, make sure you have a good service station near by your place.ENGINE REFINEMENT.This is the place where I got disappointed. There are rumors going around as they have completely fixed the vibration issues, but it's not true. It feels better below 4.5k RPM. However, once you cross 5k RPM, the vibration will creep in, you will be able to feel the vibration in handlebars, footpegs and seats, its not too much but its still there. The wind shield vibrates like hell and it makes a buzzy sound between 5k-6k RPM. The vibration tappers out once you cross 6k. I mean the vibrations are still there, but its less. The engine also makes some noise similar to tappet noise.Overall, it's something that we can live with, don't expect super refinement with no vibration (Thats what the review says).OVERALL VERDICTOverall, it's a value-for-money machine with killer looks, best-in-class mileage, decent performance and features, and great handling. The tft display is crisp and is something that we like to look at. If you are on a budget and looking for an all-rounder bike that can do daily commutes, touring, and track days, then go for this.                        ",TVS
Riding experience is the best part of owning this beast when someone. Overtakes you can easily accelerate him even if he is a kilometre far away from you this beast makes everyone have a glance at you ... Love this beast a lot and it's too good for a fantasy lover of bikes to buy this beast as his opinion. I am a big fan of apache as it maintains its brand value,TVS
                            It is value for money bike! it gives an average 33kmpl ! it speedo meter is tft display which is like a mobile. It maintaining cost not so much. If you think to buy it then you should go for it. Rr 310 is one of the best single-cylinder bikes. The top speed is 167 I got.One of the best bikes.Value for money.                        ,TVS

I started loving day by day but I felt very sad is lean angle is not available in the bike, apache 200 has a lean angle option but  why not in 310 RR                        ",TVS

"                            The bike is worthy for its cost. The bike produces an enormous energy that gives a feel of a super bike. The bike looks like a beast ,but the back seat was so little and makes the co-passenger uncomfortable. Everyone says that the service cost of the bike was more , but exactly its reasonable the parts of the bike are so costly ,when we replace any of the parts it rates high .But the parts will work for a long .

No it was very comfortable for long rides seating comfortable was awesome for rider. It is little bit difficult for pillion rider. Bike performance and controlling was mind blast!! You don't feel the pothole when you are above 90 kms/h.Coming to looking - No another word mainly RR310 red looks like Mini Panagale. Maintenance cost is OK not much high.And finally if you're looking to buy a bike around 3L budget there is no another choice. You can blindly go for it.                        ",TVS

"                            In its 2020 version, the TVs apache rr 310 gets the ""ride by wire"" technology. This move by TVs is very intelligently incorporated as meeting bs 6 norms and producing the same power and torque was not an easy task.The various ride modes are especially very effective for a newbie who can tend to over rev the bike which produces 34 ps of power.The Michelin road 5 ""donuts"" are a real blessing for conquering the corners. Not to mention, it already had a slipper clutch since the beginning of time though.Also, with the introduction of the new tft monitor, and the ""smart connect"" option, riding now becomes even more thrilling.To sum it up- this is the real contender out in the urban jungle.

After happily riding for a few months, I got to know that, it's not serviceable every where. Spare parts cost was also very high.

"                            1. My buying experience was pretty much good well before buying for one year i made a through search like which one is better had good features and all . And at last i bought it . The feeling was special since it was bought from my hard earned money. Well to be exact proud hahaha. The paper work and all the formalities got done very fast and they didn’t take much time to introduce me to my beast . 2. Most of the bikes are uncomfortable to ride on but the tvs apache rr 310, thankfully isn’t an uncomfortable motorcycle to ride. The tall handlebars along with not so rear set foot pegs translate into a forward-leaning posture that doesn’t put too much strain on the back, shoulders and wrists. As a result, you can ride this motorcycle to work or college without having to carry a pain-relieving spray. The rider seat too is wide and has good cushioning, with enough space for taller riders also to move around freely. Overall, it’s comfortable enough to go touring if you’re reasonably fit and for a motorcycle that can perform impressively at the track 3. Design is an area that tvs has completely aced for the apache rr 310 and i personally find its design to be the best in the sub-650 cc segment. Tvs has claimed its 35 years of racing experience to have gone into the development of this motorcycle and as far as design is concerned, the apache rr 310 appears to be stunning as far as the looks are concerned . In the red shade, it is reminiscent of ducati’s sportbikes. It’s always a visual treat for bike lovers like me. 4. Servicing and maintenance are pretty much good as far i am concerned. It actually depends where u get the servicing done. 5. Pros:- it’s looks are the best. Cons:- i’m worried about few plastic parts.                        ",TVS

"                            An amazing motorcycle from a Indian manufacturer tvs apache rr 310 jointly developed by bmw is definitely deserves a bow. Fit and finish is top notch feels the premium quality in every where. Power and torque is very good and present through out the rev range. Ergonomics are very comfortable but not the pillion seat. Upside: 1. Looks 2. Performance 3. Practicality 4. Breaks 5. Futuristic console 6.Smooth gear box 7. Abs 8. Bi led headlamp 9. Reverse inclined dohc engine for longer swing arm. Down side : 1. Pillion comfort 2. Vibes are present very much at higher rpm 3. Absence of slipper clutch 4. Cornering grip from the tyres 5. Pricing is bit 15 k higher (*manageable) 6. Small 11l tank 7. Heats up lot (heat deception vents are good to keep riders leg safe from the heat.) Verdict : finally it's a very good bike to buy as no motorcycle is 100% perfect.  Still it's a very good package as it can do daily commute, touring and track riding effortlessly. A good all-rounder.                        ",TVS
"                            the price is little bit high than expected but it is worthy,  the riding position is so comfortable and relaxing not much aggressive, performance is little bit low than rc 390 but it just have 312 cc according to this its performance is speechless, service cost is not that much high and relabel, buy it you will definitely enjoy it.

                            Perfect balance between city rider and sports tourer. Will not disappoint you on long rides. Engine vibrations are little above 6k rpm but not sure whether it's as bad as rc as i haven't owned one to compare. Overall the package provided by tvs/bmw collaboration is awesome. Worth buy for our money. Enjoying daily commute and occasional long rides.                        ,TVS

Bike looks good but contain 313cc engine without slipper clutch is sucks.At least provide optional slipper clutch feature in it.Looks wise it's good.Perfection in design.Performance is awesome.Need not to adjust like r15 sittingHanding in good.Not even a single bike in this range who contain reverse inclined engine.Overall it's good package in the 2-3 lakh range.,TVS
                            Good looking bike for that price and built with quality for Indian roads.Good service at every time.Keeping their customers needs and built with care.

It is a amazing bike but i'm not sure about service of this bike because it vary from city to city. Its acceleration is good but not good as 390's of ktm it look fabulous not as 300cc bike but a bigger bike of 600-800cc its one point because of which i bought this bike. But one problem is its fuel tank capacity only 11 litres and fuel tank is made up of plastic which may not be reliable but the finishing of this bike is very awesome.,TVS

                            I have heard the chaos  of ktm rc 390 and ninja 300 but the fact is that this machine is better than the two and some people complain that there are lots of vibrations but let me tell you that this is not a problem and it has no impact on bike ....Dude its 312 cc motorcycle and the vibrations are obvious but the most pathetic part is the service and dealing with customers of tvs motors company .They have hired illiterate workers in all showrooms.                        ,TVS
"                            Buying experience very worst. the Actual Price differs from online for the same city. For what we are paying 30,000 extra. Companies should look over that what's going in market. Just shocked what is printed on the sell letter and what am I paying.. Riding is GoodLooks is just good. More plastic body means more damages when it falls in case. But the look is ok. Servicing will depend on your riding Conditions.  one thing I would like to tell that if you have expenses a huge sum on showoff then you can bear it.  that's not a issue. Pros is handling position, lights and look. Cons- According to BHP I feel that power output lacks. I think maintaining mileage they did this knowingly.That's all                        ",TVS

It gets all features from big bikes like rc390. It's really tvs's answer to all other manufacturer in india. The torque on this things kicks in as early as 6000rpm. Braking on this bike is good but can do better. The headlamps on this bike looks like zx10r at night rides. The tail lamps looks more like panigale r. And the 35yrs graphics on tail looks awesome.                        ,TVS
The bike has max.  Features .And it is very good as it's price is also satisfactory in this price it is brilliant and for riders of long ride it is brilliant bike .It is full fairing bike .I love it.

"This bike took 2 years in the making and finally when it was launched it was worth the wait.A bmw engine inside an Indian motorcycle,first of its kind in India.Though it's performance is not in close proximity with rc 390.This bike was designed keeping Indian bike enthusiasts in mind,tvs knows that not every rider lives next to a race track.So apache rr310 manages to balance  beautifully between track racing and daily commute.Unlike rc 390 which is a bit faster but lacks in ride comfort and safety.Moreover there's a difference of 50k when it comes to on road price. 50k for an extra 10bhp is absolutely rubbish.Tvs apache rr310 is a clear victor in this segment.",TVS
                            First of all looking is very sexy and riding very smooth. Headlight is very nice with looking. Seat is very comfortable. 300km continue riding not stopping. Speed ??grips.

The sound of the exhaust is not that great at lower rpms but gets better as you rev it. The instrument console is eye catchy and sure that people will ask you if it's your phone attached there.

Riding experience on this bike is like on a whole another level as i came from yamaha r15 it makes a smile on my face as i rev. The throttle the ride is very smooth the power delivery is linear as well as aggressive it depends upon you riding type.3. Talking about the looks and performance it is the top notch as you can expect from a bmw engine. The looks it carries is not as like a 310 cc bike it can be considered as a 650 as it has a muscle body work and a big bike feel to it.4. I was very much concerned about the services and maintenance as i am from bihar and i purchase the bike from lucknow as it was the nearest point where i can get the bike so i have to deal with the servicing part as for 1st service i rode the bike to lucknow which is approx 420 km from here on my way i tested the bike fully the top end the mid range the abs everything works flawlessly.5. In my view i don't think this bike has any kind of cons it is a perfect wholesome package and the best seller in 300 to 400 cc bikes as it surpasses the selling numbers of ktm rc 390 and duke 390 love to have the bike.                        ,TVS
                            Nice bike Always love you .Great design nice look Secure ride apache and tvs seller is always best for bike performance she is best for new and stylish look Apache bikes are nice and ride better for long drive and tour It's always comfortable for long drive I always like it and my all over favourite bikes in all India of apache And best of luck for the new design in next bike launch.                        ,TVS
                            Actually it's my dream bike. According to track bikes rr310 it's one of the best and lesser cost which also suites for long rides. If we compare to rc390 and rr310 rc crossed with smaller distance.The rr front and side parts looks damn sexy. But editions for this is less. Please live more editions for this bike. Hat's off you sir for it's designing and for manufacturer also.                        ,TVS

"                            The machine is pretty genuine when it comes to a racing bike but you can't expect something hard core for the race tracks.  The digital tachometer provides lots of information . The acceleration is just superb , can leave everyone behind you on the roads. The only downside i feel is the seating position.  You can't go for a 100 km ride on this bike but occasional racing and leisure driving is the one which goes with the bike hand to hand.  The exhaust could be a bit more better .                        ",TVS

                            best bike under it's rate tag power is just awesome and headlight is best in all bike far better than rc 390 looks are awesome and sitting position is very comfortable but tvs is doing 1 thing wrong they have to advertise this bike because many people don't even know that Apache is also coming in 310 when people asked me which bike is this and I answered Apache they said is it modified because they don't know Apache is available in 310 cc segment.                        ,TVS
Well its been long waiting for this bike Rr310 best in class look Built clean and perfect.Exhaust could have done differently.City ride and for touring both it is perfect bike.No need to worry about heating issues.Its well designed that keeps the heat from hitting the legs.It comes in 2 colour variantMate black and sport redFirst the red colour looks stunning but after seeing them many times you may go for mate black Red looks dam stunning and very attractive Mate black *colour wont fade *classic looking even after seeing many timesMate black colour perfect for all kind of dressing In both colours the apache rr310 looks stunning Best in riding comfort. 312cc bike with 160km high speed great job for the new engine technology. We can all say that this is an entry level bike If you want perfect sport-bike experience For for 2 cylinder bike.But you wont get enough mileage. Rr310 gives you 30-35 mileage. Even after thrash riding I heard many negatives about the service of tvs I hope you like my review ,TVS
                            I was  bought Apache rr 310 few months ago it's give more cheer full feeling and it's give affordable millage  and it's give superbike feeling for me  tqq tvs India's brand 💞🥰😍I love u lot tvs India's number one brand Apache series one of the brand in India it gives more competition to another bikes                        ,TVS
When i heard that tvs is going to launch a 300cc bike i was very eager for its launch i once saw this bike tested on the road  i was just impressed by its looks i hope this bike will surely beat the rivals and win the market i love apache (akula) 310rr one of my favourite one tvs has given its best to this bike i hope .,TVS
I don't have buying experience. No riding experience because i don't have this bike Looks is awesome performance is also good i read the details.It's to good I just love this bike I need to make own as soon as possible It's look fully sporty bike Colour is also too good.I want to purchase this bike and i am waiting for this bike to launch ,TVS
"Nice bike, speed is good, very powerful engine and fast bike, i use my bike daily for going market and for work, smoothly comfortable bike nice to ride. my bike's mileage is 40-50km, i get 42 km average mileage from my bike. Purchase this bike, very nice and smooth bike.",TVS
"Well... This new baby is hell of a class, you can't spit words without riding a one. This new tvs product brings a whole new package as we all the specifications :-) But, the ergonomics & the design structure is winning hearts & hearts. Last & foremost if you got a budget or { can stretch a little bit ;-) } get this baby monster!!",TVS
I have just issue with the service team.Others all are great. Tvs is getting better like anything.I never expected this kind of design from tvs. I wondered in the beginning but its really awesome. I don't have words to express about rr. With this super bike youth have git some interest towards the brand.Hope this will be a success bike,TVS
I believe this is one of the racing bike manufactures by an Indian company which can give racking experience and also can be used for daily use. The engineers have really done their home work by studying the needs for an customer. When is comes to looks this bike is not less then any other super bikes. However for 310 cc i feel the price is little high. When the super-bikes are manufactured in India i biggest advantages for any Indian customer is price of a bike. I wish our Indian company comes up with more super-bikes with more power.,TVS
"                            Super comfort riding, the road presence of the bike is awesome, the exhaust note is so good and the pillion seat is a little bit hard and it's wanting more cushioning little bit of vibration in the fairing while riding in off roads and on highways bike performance was superb. over-all 8.5/10.                        ",TVS
"                            I purchased rr in July with bto setup, the website is nice but it needs more alterations to look better when you book bto model. After the first service I went to spiti valley and rode 2500km in 10 days in monsoon and I felt so confident while riding on the plain road, off roads, the suspension is so nice, and when adjusting it comes out more beautifully to absorbs shock. The bike is so balanced that it doesn't require anything else. So I give 5/5 in riding experience. Well, the look is obviously eye-catchy, wherever I go everyone pauses and stare at this beauty for a while. So, 5/5 in looks also. Now the only thing is which i think needs improvement is servicing, tvs should make a different section for rr310 in their major service centers across the city, it's where I don't receive that premium experience of owning a sports race track bike. Plus only a limited mechanic is trained to counter this bike, so if that person is not available by any chance you have to wait for the next day or more. So in my opinion bike is drastically 5/5 its only lags when it comes to service. Rest is a must-bike to own.P.S. It does look much much better than rc390.                        ",TVS
"                            I would like to share my review of my TVS Apache RR310, Buying experience was a pleasure, Service centre people are also knowledgeable and cooperative. It's a great Bike with Loads and Loads of features like Bluetooth connectivity, Navigation, TVS connect App, which includes all the data related to bike and bike statistics, you may book the service and check the service history as well. The performance is extremely well, just loved it. Looks amazing and it's very eye catchy, wherever I go, It grabs proper attention every time & people ask questions about it and that makes me a proud owner of it. As a sports bike is concerned Its Riding Posture is also favourable for Riders. But it needs a proper parking space as it has a fibre body and needs to be parked carefully. Service and maintenance are also favourable, thanks to the service network of TVS and spare parts are also readily available. According to me below are the pros and cons which I felt.Pros- 1. Good Riding Quality.2. Superb Sitting posture.3. Awesome eye-catchy looks.4. Great Power Output and Pickup.5. Efficient braking.6. Bright Projector headlights, with beautiful tail lights.7. Superb Road Grip with Michelin Tyres.8. Favourable Engine Sound.9. 4 Riding Modes.10. Exceptional looking 5-inch Color Digital speedometer which shows all the data about the performance, service records, mileage display settings, navigation assist, auto brightness etc etc etc.11. Value for Money.12. Adjustable Suspension Setup.13. Less Vibey in nature than previous models.14. Very light Clutch, thanks to the slipper clutch.Cons-1. Pillion is Not favourable for Old age people and Obese persons as the seat height is very high.2. Very small footrest both for rider and pillion.3. Requires proper parking space as it has a fibre body which needs proper care and handling.4. Joints of Turn indicators are very weak. 5. Navigation assists and Bluetooth connectivity is unresponsive sometimes and needs to be upgraded by software upgrade by the company. For Bluetooth Connection we have to forget the device and then establish/pair again.                        ",TVS
"                            I just bought this beast about a month ago. The engine sounds good. And the swiftness in the control is just something unspeakable. It has an awesome pickup with great breaking control. Never have I ever felt that it's out of control. Whether it be in speed or slow in traffic.

"From start to end the maintained a good reputation in my thinking they are all good but it is the beginning of becoming best and nowadays it's best of the best .As it got killer looks , sexy curves ,great engine and yes it's truly  said ""racing dna unleashed"" if you wanna stay in competition you have kill it . Great engine with a descent mileage which other will lack and rest will do the talking just start and it will make you feel what does it have to offer . If road is rough it will manage but not to fast and it's pick up is bit more than ktm so it's will make you learn to deal with it .The speed it can go up to 150 in a start but i haven't gone that much too risky as having a problem in handling in high speed . But it will make tired you in too much long ride . It doesn't make much curvature on turns . Overall good bike not much seeing them on road but thinking it is about to rule the streets .",TVS
This is the first time an Indian company launched stunning sports bike in India which can afford anyone who wanted to buy super-bike in cheapest rate.If you want to buy such kind of bike of any other brand you wants to pay more than 3-4 lakh & due to Indian made  you need not want to import spare parts of this bike from anywhere.This is my dream bike,TVS

"                            Well well well.......This bike is no less than a beast, needs to be leashed sometimes. At 2.5 lakh this bike may come closer to value for money, but it depends on you whether you use it for commuting or touring. For city use, considering the mileage is a great experience. But for touring, when u go past 7000 rpm, there is some kind of vibrations coming to handle bars and foot pegs, which kind of annoys you. Look is very macho in it's class (300 cc). Seating position is quite good and doesn't tire you out. The instrument console is very easy to read and gives you all the information at a glance. The abs is also very well calibrated, have a very positive feedback. Fit and finish is top notch. Doesn't feel like a quarter litre bike, unless you see the 310 badge...So overall a great bike. Can be considered..Always wear helmet and be safe on road.Have a great day...                        ",TVS

                            Buying experience of the bike is superb. but there is small amount of vibration in the handle bar and it is not suitable for smooth ridding. the sitting comfort is nice and comfortable sitting position but before buying the bike cheek the bike any scratch are there in  the bike mine incident was not good. but the bike looks like the beast. power pulls the rider back if accelerate. but I loved the bike because of the looks and performance.                        ,TVS

Servicing and maintenance not costly as you think. Amazing throttle response, great riding position, comfortable for long rides. Rear brake not that good, pillion seat is not comfortable,  little vibration or higher rpm.                        ",TVS

                            Motor cycle is very good. But the service that I received was very deceptive. There was no one to tell the information. Everybody was young. No one is smart. We got the most bogus service at Bhansali Ahmednagar. and I'm very disappointed  worst service in ahemadnagar bhansali motors please TVS solve this problem.. Very Very disappointed.                        ,TVS
                            It's a very good bike.....For youths....Riding is amazing as it has hydraulics suspension front and rear .The rear view is somewhat sporty.....But it has very high maintenance. ...Because of its features....I use it once or twice in every month when i go for my meeting with my client at delhi. ..And finally thanks to tvs for making such a good sports bike...                        ,TVS

                            this is the nice bike and his performance are better or controlling  is very nice.The aimed mileage of is tvs apache rr 310 31 kmpl. But the mileage always depends on the road condition and riding skills of the rider. Ridding the vehicle more on economical speed and maintaining the tyre pressure will always help to increase the mileage of any vehicle.                        ,TVS

"                            Absolute bang for the buck. At 2,38,000, you can't expect much. Either go with bajaj/ktm or royal enfield. But this one here totally redefined my point of view. Feels so premium. Century tvs, pune sales executives are very polite and helpful. I use it for commuting daily and weekend rides. Gives you a big bike feeling and trust me it has quite a road presence. Despite that it's really nimble. You could change lanes with just a flick. Overtaking is a breeze. I don't want to go into specifications. They are all over the internet. Gives me around 30kmpl. The bike may heat up but you don't feel it as much. Mostly near the left thigh but it's bearable not a deal breaker whatsoever. Ride quality is just superb. It's just so plush. You don't feel a bump. Although not for off-roading, it could cover some rough patches with no issues. You don't feel like you're sitting on top of it, it's like you're sitting into it. You're surrounded by it and that's a great confidence booster. No back pain. And you can even adjust the levers and rear suspension to your needs so that's a plus point. Minor vibrations but it's a single cylinder so you can't just make them go away. Rear view mirrors are useful. Riding at night is also good. Headlights are quite bright and illuminate the road ahead of you brilliantly. Wind protection is awesome. Once you tuck in you can harldy feel or hear any wind noise. Michelin street pilots hold the road quite well. Tyre life is around 20000 kms. So you can harldy complain. Abs is a lifesaver. Saved me twice so yes i know. I got no words for the braking although could use some more initial feedback from the front brake. You can stop as quickly as you can accelerate from a standstill.Build quality is just beyond expectations. The paint job is superfine. No loose or exposed wiring. An attention grabber in red. She's a beauty. Absolutely mesmerizing. They put a lot of thought into the design. The headlamps and especially the the taillamps are a treat to look at. Caught a cousin ogling at it on a traffic signal. He was so into it that he didn't even notice me on top of it. Got first servicing done around 850 kms. Cost me around rs. 1300. They changed the oil and oil filter. Looked upon some vibration issues and did a routine check up. Pretty reasonable if you're buying a 200k+ motorbike. The service adviser was really helpful and heard my issues with bike thoroughly and rectified them as much as he could. Although there's just one service center for the entire city for apache rr310. It'd be helpful if there were some more. Tremendous job done by tvs. Pros:Design. Power packed engine.Quite refined. Linear power delivery. Hell of a ride. Better than most so called cruisers in the segment.Build quality. Abs as standard.Reasonable maintenance costs.Cons:Just one service center for an entire city.                        ",TVS
                            Its simply a head turner bike with superb performance.. I am riding it for more than two months.  Minor vibration are there which could be rectified.. Only thing which is concerning me is the bike build quality. Looks premium but the quality is definitely not. Pillion ride is even good too. Nothing to complain.. Taking a u turn is quite difficult due to its turning radius .                        ,TVS
"                            Best bike vs bmw g 0 , i am fully satisfied with rr310 and highly recommend to everyone , if any one go for this budget so you can buy rr 310 , very comfortable to regular rider , this is not sporty rider , if you are going for ktm, so first everyone check out this bike then take your decision , because i love this bike.

"                            I honestly say i have no buying experience but i ride this model many times . A royal , comfortable,sporty and luxurious riding experience in it .I think this is the best riding experience ever. No comparison in looking it looks cool and more attractive then ktm , pulsar and other brands . Service cost is also easy affordable . It looks smashing but slightly under powered .                        ",TVS

"                            Well.. Here we go  to talk about the fantastic red beast aka apache-310rr. To start with the buying process! well i just read about apache 310 at this site. And was curious to know about this bike. On very next day i went to showroom to see the beautiful red beast and trust me at first look bike was pulling me towards itself like a magnet. The first look of this bike is as fresh as a rose in the garden. Then after having a test ride,trust me i immediately booked the bike. And am proudly owner of this bike. As we all know nothing is perfect in this universe & yes there are some limitations in it as well. But trust me guys the beauty and pros of this bike overcomes the cons of bike just perfectly and don't let you disappoint. Pros- 1. The perfect finish and looks (10/10)2. Riding comfort (10/10)3. Bmw 1 cylinder reverse inclined engine just makes it wow (10/10)4. Stability (10/10)5. Suspension (10/10)Cons-1. The heat comes out straight to your thighs so making little bit uncomfortable while driving. (7/10)2. Braking could have been bit more efficient. (7/10).                        ",TVS
"                            Bike looks and performance is superb, riding position is very comfortable, after long drive you won’t feel like your back is paining at all, bike is giving mileage of 25km/l which is very good for this performance level bike, service & maintenance is very good and not too costly. Cons: little bit vibration in bike.                        ",TVS

Apache has given this bike a good and effective engine. This also reflects every bikers love and proved a fascinating model for the bike. I loved it.                        ",TVS
"                            1 buying experience Had brought rr310 on 03.06.2018, initial  stage of launch, so waited almost 2 months after booking 2. Riding experience Switched from r15, it was feeling great on riding this beast and enjoying every ride with it. 3. Looks wise great and when it comes to performance, more vibrations during low rpm and pick up is awesome, dual channel abs does its job well. Feels something different on corners, which makes me to do cornering aggressively.4 worst part is service.. With limited service stations, need to take around 50kms for service and after free service it costs around 8-10k per service and spares.. Must have padlock stand with the bike to apply chain lube every 500km, otherwise lubing chain is difficult 5 pros:Looks, pickup, brakes. Cons:Vibrations, noise, service. If you are looking for a bike to use in track  or for touring long ride u ca n blindly go for it. For daily commute, it is not advisable.                        ",TVS

"                            Pros: 1) look (obviously)2) torque n linear power supply 3) handling (mainly at high speed; i have done 165kmph on road n still faced no problem in handling)4) sports cum touring bike (easy riding experience)5) Michelin tyres do their work well. Cons:1) engine heats up at low speed or during traffic.2) slight vibrations at speed > 120kmph. 3) during cornering, the foot rest often scratches the ground, and causes problem at high speed cornering.4) bit costly.

"                            Dear friends after getting this rr 310 bs6 with few updates i am really wanna appreciate to tvs company the look of this bike it really unique  i already have four different companies sports bike but now rr310 bs6 becomes my favorite it has a great powerful engine i used this bike to ride daily n it gives around 35-37 km/pl mileage (depend how you use ).I have driven this bike from mumbai to ahmedabad around 550 kms one side,amazing experience it has 4 driving modes never seen in other regular sporty segments with 5 inch led screen. Riding posture is very comfortable, braking system are excellent, and also comfortable for long rides as per my self experience. I also have ktmrc390, yamaha r15, n ninja650r. But believe me i had never experienced of this apache rr 310 it has good mileage n bike is loaded with all premium features which gives u feel like premium sports bike n it stands a unique from the crowd  like it gives u everything u want like power mileage driving comfort etc. On my 1st service i have done in front of me and i am fully satisfied because of there care taking excellent n value for money worth to buy. No comparison 5 out of 5 excellent.                        ",TVS
                            The best bike i have ever ride. It gives speed with the feeling of premium stuff. At this budget i don't think so that any bike can compete this devil. Ktm rc 390 in also a great choice but it's sitting posture is that much good and may you get some back ache.The tvs apache rr 310 gives you a best posture and comfortable for city ride as well as long ride.                        ,TVS
"                            (the riding posture is more on the committed side, enough room to move around though)Goes like stink! drop a gear, twist the throttle and you will leave more or less every motorist on the road, in your wake. All thirty three and a half horses break into full gallop at 9,700 revs and a huge chunk of it comes between 5,000 and 8,000 rpm. There is this delicious pull that the bike churns out at the same revs, threatening to raise the front wheel skyward. The exhaust note is gruff, having an uncanny similarity to that of an l-twin engine and when revved hard, it gets even better. No pops and crackles though!                        ",TVS
"                            Bike has a very good build quality Thanks to the bmw collaboration. It's slightly overpriced but don't forget that you're getting the looks of a expensive bike. So yeah this bike is definitely an eye-catcher. The maintenance cost are very high,i.E., only major con in this vehicle.Exhaust note should have been slight better but it's a single cylinder so there's nothing more you could expect.

                            The worst ever scooter I have experienced. The running is very clumsy. Riding experience is very bad. The mileage is very very poor. You won't see any positive change in your riding as well as after its servicing. They just do the so called free service (which is actually not) in a very casual manner.                        ,Honda
"                            Although my buying experience is not good because of the dealer but riding of activa is very hassle free , easy to handle with loads and without loads. Look is for me it's simple and good. Service and maintenance is very affordable till date i had not spent any extra money on it instead of regular service. It's performing well and getting mileage of 45-47 kmpl in city and 50-52 kmpl on highway with economy speed.                        ",Honda
"                            I purchased activa 125 in 2018 and driven approx. 23,000 km's. Mileage is very less compare to other scooter, it gives only 170 km's, front body is also too delicate and it's color is also fade out. I am using this for office purpose only. Performance is also very bad.                        ",Honda
"                            It's so comfortable soothing ride, awesome suspension, new features, silent start. I don't have words how cool this scooter activa is. Recommended to all. Loved it.  Excel Honda provide good services. Most recommended bike in scooters anyone can buy activa with there awesome offers.                        ",Honda
"                            While buying looked like paying too much for my first vehicle but after lot of web search & discussions so it was also in price range of 70k including accessories.Ride is smooth but lacks quality suspension sound is quieter than competitors, provides milage of around 50 in pune at 10 months, space for keeping legs is not spacious enough for my height (5' 11"") , weight balance is good which makes balancing easy.Color i liked most crust metallic metal body looks good too in that color.Free servicing are provided by company for an year, maintenance is very less Pros good for city rides. Good mileage. Cons: Fuel capacity small. Not good for long trips or outside city.                        ",Honda
                            I purchased activa bs6 fi model on 14 January 2021 I faced so many issues like the first issue is delivered scooter had disc panel issue so after lots of fight and complaints they changed it- Raam Honda and then 2nd issue I faced is engine issue scooter is not running smoothly and had vibrations after 40 speed. I paid 102000 for the scooter. I have raised complaints now I  will go to consumer forum as they sold me manufacturing defect scooter .Don't believe on Honda as they are just looting because of their goodwill. Never thought this would have happened with me.-buying experience from raam Honda Hyderabad-worst experience- as they given accessories duplicate not activa or Honda made.-riding experience -manufacturing defect bike-what to expect-just worst.-looks is good performance is worst.-service centers are just fooling and looting customers. After saying free service still they charge around 600 rupees.-no pros I found only cons. Its a good con from Honda.                        ,Honda
"                            Very comfortable. In long drive, we can carry lots of weight, smooth, nicely and caring designed bike. It looks beautiful, colors are attractive, great mileage. Well designed bike. very use full and important bike. We would like to thanks. To one who design it and it is worth. very use full thank you.                        ",Honda
"                            Purchased by my sister in 2009 and it has not given major trouble since then, ride has been smooth, maintenance has been at average cost, gives average around 50, never has been punctured or give trouble in midway, no major engine work has been done, sturdy body, still in very good condition after driven for around 25000 kms, service at periodic intervals and we get engine oil changed at 500 or 700 km, try to get filters changed at periodic intervals or told so by mechanic, color is also in good condition, good for daily commute.                        ",Honda
"                            Cons: annoying sound from the bike. Overall good performance. Pickup is good. Now days these kind of bike I never ride. Error in digital meter, it always shows wrong details. E.g. range, Petrol lid closing is a big task. It never shuts easily. you have to watch a YouTube video for solving the issue. Initially, the bike starts silently. But, later the DJ sound begins while riding.                        ",Honda
"                            Buying experience: Very worst experience in showroom. Customer handling : Very worst. Riding  experience: Average, based on riding style. Looks: Good Performance: Very worst scooter ever used. First 6 months was good . After 6 months instrument console not working. Auto idling is not working. Electric start not working.Service: Very worst service.Maintenance: maintenance cost is high. First 3 months only free service.  Free service cost around 600rs each. After free service from 4th service maintenance cost is 1600rs. Paying high also. But service are not upto the level. Very worst service. Pros: Good for first 6 months. After 6 month pro for showroom alone. Cons. Very worst customer handling. Very worst maintenance.                        ",Honda
"                            I was just wondered with the colour and riding experience was cool while driving in city roads, performance was better and comfortable. Servicing is abut nearly 700 rs .People who wants carry some bags and luggage it's better. People who drives the gear bike it feels uncomfortable and feel some back pain.                        ",Honda
"                            Activa 125 bs 6 delivered to me as promise date is a joy to ride this scooter. Stunning looks and love to hear the music of exhaust note which is bold  So for no issues with this scooter as it is fitted with tried, tested & refined engine Starting the engine without ""chick-chick sound"" is really fun to start, Fuel injection system doesn't required choke for cold start is really great pain reliever.                        ",Honda
"                            Vehicle is amazing For ride. I love to ride this vehicle. For long journey it's comfort for passenger. Mileage about 48 approximate. Compare to access 125, Activa 125 is good and have more safety features. Looks also good. Activa 125 is more demand vehicle in scooter. Negative charging option is not available in activa 125.                        ",Honda
                            Overall the scooter is good for ride Pros:1. Better rode control 2. Good breaking 3. Decent mileage but not great 4. Good seating 5. Powerful enough to carry your regular groceries Cons:1. Heavy kerb weight (difficult to handle by lean girls/new driving learners) 2. Mileage figure should have been more due to new modifications in engine.                        ,Honda
"                            This is a very good scooter im using from 1yr . It has very power  compare to other scooty like deo.  It is very smooth to handle, maintenance is little easy. It make service some ethical problems to which service is not that good. I love this scooter anybody can trustful buy. Going long journey is little tuff but using for commercial work is very good.                        ",Honda
"                            Honda activa 125 is best scooty i have ever find. Its looks amazing mileage is also very good, and the pickup of this scooty is outstanding i love it, honda service is also best one they never delay in any thing , always give priority to customers my riding experience with this scooty is amazing, i have this scooty since 1 year and now also its new class type.                        ",Honda
"                            The built quality is really nice. The riding position and seat is also comfortable. The worst is the trips to the service centers. They don't know to how to talk. They don't change the engine oil. Also, they add extra items while giving the bill and when you ask them to show the cans, they simply refuse to do so. Also, if you a tell them to do the service in from of you, they say that the company has a strict policy of not doing so in front of customers.                        ",Honda
"                            That's a really good scooty in this price range. It's engine refinement is just awesome, mileage is near about 45 km/l in high road & 42 in city.Low maintenance cost. No vibration even in the top speed of 90-93km/hFront telescopic suspension works really good . Metal built body .Overall best scooty in this price segment. One thing can be update that is instrument cluster can be digital & top speed can be more .                        ",Honda
"                            I am a very big fan of activa, riding it since 2010. Initiated with activa then activa 125 and currently riding activa 125 (2021). Overall experience is very good.Buying experience:Buying in cash is as simple as buying something from the grocery store. Some banks give pre-approved offers through which the process is so simple and easyRiding experience:Effortless drive, pinpoint balancing on roads even at 5 kmph speed. Instant pickup. Amazing ride in traffic.Looks, performance:The design & look is simple, sober, and efficient. Hassle freely you can carry the family stuff (either under the seat or near your feet.Below are some pros & cons according to me.Pros:1. One of the best scooters to ride within the city limit, especially in crowded traffic cities.2. I can say the scooter is diamond point balance (pinpoint balance) even at 5 km/h speed. Which I never experienced in any other scooter or bike.3. The handle movement is pressure less. We can avail narrow turns which helps a lot in traffic.4. Instant speed up5. Over all design, the look is ok.Cons.1. The rider seat can be more comfortable, the engineering department should think about it.Last but not least, i can say it is a complete family scooter, and every home needs it.                        ",Honda
                            Honda is the best automobile company according to me.The scooty is quite smooth on roads and gave me a very good riding experience.It is also good in look. If you service it in according to the given time it will give you the best performance.I suffered with a  mileage issue with this scooty ..Overall it is the best scooty in this range.                        ,Honda
"                            It's good for daily uses like,for go to offices and more Not for long trips; i am not thinking that this is good for long trips because i feels like there is very shake and i think it is not comfortable for long trips I think the persons who like to go with a high speed don't buy this,the persons like that go for any sports but if you like it so much then just go for it.                        ",Honda
                            Buying experience was good. No time taken to the delivery brought in single day. Riding experience is very good.It's good for everyday use for household work and also going for somewhere.It have the best look in its segment and the performance is really good never give me trouble when i am going to anywhere. Service and maintenance is very good and cheap. First six services are free from labour cost. Just 2 days before i got it service and the driving belt and the driving rules are changed that will cost around 2000 rupees after 3 years it may be it or seventh service.                        ,Honda
"                            I have purchased the top model with disc brake version. Only 3 colour options are there that's a selection limitation. Grey colour is not easily available.Pros:-1. For riding in city traffic it's a blessing. It has feature of idle stop and start with gentle throttle. It's very handy.2.Silent start and unless the side stand is up it won't start are some attractive features.3.Trip meter and watch in digital instrument is a plus point.4.Acceleration pick up and load carrying capacity is very good.5.Mileage is far better than most of the bikes. It gives overall 55-57 km/l in city with gentle throttle. On highway it gives 58-59 km/l in economy driving.Cons:-1.I am unhappy with it's stiffer suspension setup as bikewale also mentioned. It hurts the butts after 2-3 hour long riding. Therefore long riding without intermediate breaks is very painful.2.Due to disc brake and weight on rear wheel side it skids and slips on road with dirt, sand or mud in case of panic or hard braking and due to this i hurt my knee.Servicing and maintenance is almost zero cost just oil change and you are ready to go.                        ",Honda
"                            1) buying experience- bought when it launched in october 2019 , no discount (still in 2021) , full cash paid for purchase(might get when you have emi )2)riding experience and performance- i've been using this since oct 2019 ,very stiff ride , unstable ride above 60kph, suspension quality is bad, it has power but it has its limit, only get about 40 to 45 mileage, low petrol tank capacity I mean c'mon 5 litre tank( 1.5 for reserve) , at least they should have given 6 to 7 litre tank3)Details about looks- looks are good but small plastic and rubber(mid button is gone) elements are worn out very quickly, very bad paint quality , accessories are very costly, my scooter came with maxxis tires (china tyre).4)servicing and maintenance - servicing cost is higher than competitor , spare parts are not available even its been almost 2 years since its launch, minor and deep scratches when scooter is in showroom servicing (mine is rebel red color) 5) pros and cons Pros - good engine , brand name, comfortable seat, good riding posture Cons - spare parts availability, bad rear suspension , ok mileage , heavy , vibrations on highway (above 60kph) , high maintenance cost , every small issue with scooter has to brought to the showroom (you can not get it repair outside ) ,misses few key feature Front storage space,  no usb charging port etc                        ",Honda
"                            1.buying experience is good i have buy this scooter last month.2.riding experience is very good of this scooter.easy to handle in traffic.3.looks is very good of honda activa 125 bs6 standard,performance is very good of this scooter its give about 50-60 kmpl of milege in highways and in city it gives 45-50 kmpl in city.4.i have not done its first servicing.5.pros: silent start,pass light in scooter,having engine switch kill switch in start button,in this scooter you will not fell vibration too much,easy to handle in heavy traffic,having big storage in scooter,petrol fill is outside not inside the seat,its bulky body looks very good,this scooter doesnt need to much of maintenance, this scooter is very good for go with family,this scooter have mobile holder.cons: i have nothing to say about its cons because this scooter is very good for all purposes.                        ",Honda
                            Its the best for tours and even daily use but has little bit of less mileage around 40-50 km/l because of 125 cc engine. Its so good it doesn't problem till 6-7 years but after that small problem you will face like buttons not working like before battery is not working properly although batteries work about 7-8 years.                        ,Honda
"                            It runs smoothly. It has powerful brakes and an amazing speed with no sound violence. When i got to know about its price, i felt glad because it was not too much high. It is really affordable. Apart from all of it, it is eco-friendly too. It has nice look and attractive body. Nobody would ever like miss a chance to take test ride on it.                        ",Honda
"                            The bike is a perfect choice for someone having a daily commute of less than 80 km per day. Would not suggest to ride for 100 km in one stretch. Buying experience was good. Ride quality is superior than competitors. Only con is lack of new generation features like phone charging, smart connectivity etc.                        ",Honda
                            Very good daily commuter. Low maintenance i have traveled 600 km in a single day for continuous 10 hrs during lock-down Best if u can ride in 40_50km. Change engine oil and air pressure on time. Top speed 90 plus Safe speed 60 beyond it your brake may not work properly not safe at all. Thank u honda. Cons: Problem in braking when heated Noise from headlight.                        ,Honda
                            Very poor lighting arrangement. The focusing area is above 5 feet.You can't drive where there are no street lights.You can't see what is on the road. They refuse to rectify the problem and said that is the design problem.Very powerful light even during the day and opposite side drivers scold me.which is irritating.                        ,Honda
                            So I've been riding the honda activa 125 since 5 years now. The mileage is not that great but still i have no issues with that. The vehicle runs smooth even till this date but of course it depends on maintenance factors. The honda service is great . Not a fan of looks but it is good. I would surely recommend this vehicle.                        ,Honda
                            The seat is too big just made for elephants.The size of activa 125cc is unnecessarily made to look big at the cost of convenience. There is no original side stand.  The seat has never been designed for human. After sitting at a convenient position and riding few hundred meters your are already thrown to the tip of the seat.  The engineer (must be a college dropout) who designed the seat may be commuting in bmw.                        ,Honda
                            Its my second active bike. Now I have 2 activa its a best scooter ever good resale value in market. But never sold it my family use it when they want. Good average good service good storage. My words become small front of my active 125. Yet I didn’t exchange any part because all working perfect. I just say wow.                        ,Honda
                            I bought this activa for daily commute. Engine is really powerful than normal 110 activa. Mileage is very less. You have to struggle for its parts as it is not available in the local market. Service is costly. Top end is not great Starting pickup is great. It is not built for rough and tough usage but to drive carefully.                        ,Honda

                            I purchased this Honda Activa 125 BS VI (Rebel Red Mettalic 2) at my home town. Really Honda did a great Achievement in the Segment of two wheeler with silent revolution. This vehicle was launched in the month of october in my city and I purchased 7 days ago before going to give this review. A awesome scooter with the good mileage and now I am getting 65.7 Average while I was riding. The Engine performance is very good with good with no noise. The LED DRLs are very impressive to look front. Its performance is good at highways. It has a choice of 4 colours. Its price is little higher compared to others two wheelers as it is consisting BS VI and Programmed F.I system. Price is worth  so don't worry guys. This scooter is good for long distances I am travelling daily 110 klms to my office. Riding quality is very good with out vibrations on the body or any other parts of the body. This review will help for others for knowing more about this vehicle. I really enjoyed with this scooter. The battery is good and free to maintain. Honda is giving 3 years of warranty in this segment. I really loved this scooter.                        ,Honda
"                            First of all i am using it for 3yrs and believe me its working still smooth as i have bought it 3yrs back provided you service your bike every year with oiling on every 2000kms, change air filter etc. The best thing i like about activa is as follows:-1.Very fast, a slight accelerator will give you a speed of 40 instantly.2.Silencer is noiseless, u wont hear any voice very smooth3.It runs like a water and won't feel the speed breaker.4.It still gives me a average of 45 after 3yrs of usage.5.Gives you luxury feel.

"                            At that price activa 125 was the best option available in the market. This vehicle is good for single and double riding but, unfortunately while triple riding, riders might go through discomfort. I think if you're buying a scooty then looks is not a matter of fact, though its look and design were quite pretty. You will get first five service free of cost (you have to pay for the parts and components like brakes etc). After 5 times, you will have to spend inr 1k-1.5k per service. Style, looks, comfort and design are quite good but, the mileage could be a weak point for this. I would recommend suzuki 125 or jupiter.                        ",Honda

Coming to mileage and performance, it gives 50 kmpl a little less than the stated 60kmpl..About service i gave it twice and i think its necessary, not bad.. Other features as luggage carrier seat space are all best in the two wheeler spectrum specifically pros- mileage, ease of driving, storage space. Cons- heavy, not easy on beginners.

I hoped honda had put a charger after taking so much money.Instrument cluster is use less. Still i bought it only because of a bigger engine & re-sale value .

Its having a big comfy seat. Cons :- 1. It has a very low mileage as compare to company claims even if you keep it fully serviced it still consume more fuel than others 3. Its very high maintenance  ,as it requires more attention to the proper cleaning and servicing and if you don't do that then its starts getting ugly for days.                        ",Honda

"                            Actually i bought honda activa in 2009 when the 2nd upgraded model was introduced. Till now no problems, running on and on. I had the habit of applying front brake, led sometimes skidding. Then made habitual of applying both the breaks simultaneously and keeping front brake less bite to desirable liking to stand upright even after breaking. By then thought of why not dual breaking and bigger size tyres to effect safe braking. But thanks lot now most of the scooters and bikes too have come with dual braking. Moreover i prefer scooters than bikes just because of their storage. Whoever increases the storage and tire size will win the market.                        ",Honda

"                            Capitalising on the ongoing fame of the 125cc bike fragment, honda has propelled the 2018 honda activa 125. At a cost of rs 59,621 (ex-showroom delhi), it directions a premium of rs 2,116 over the active model. While the bike remains outwardly same generally, there are a couple of convenient highlights that make it applicable against other, more premium 125cc bikes. Here's a speedy lowdown. Styling and lighting While the more seasoned activa 125 accompanied a traditional halogen headlamp, honda has refreshed its more up to date form with more premium and more brilliant led lighting. This is a similar setup that is seen on the honda grazia, honda activa 5g and the 2018 honda dio. Be that as it may, regardless it keeps on lodging a similar knob type markers and tail light. You additionally get dark combination haggles plated metal suppressor defender in the event that you decide on the best spec 'select' variation, which retails for rs 64,007 (ex-showroom delhi). Rest guaranteed, it is something that certainly won't go unnoticed while on the run. Highlights Honda's endeavour to keep the activa 125 important can be seen on the instrument bunch too. The reexamined setup currently gets extra eco speed marker and an administration due pointer. The activa 125 additionally gets a 4-in-1 bolt now with a seat opening switch on the cover, which is again observed on the grazia, activa and the dio. This enables you to advantageously open/close the seat, handle bolt the bike and begin the start. In any case, we'd have enjoyed an outer fuel filler top, as despite everything you have to get off the bike for fuelling up. Underpinnings and mechanical Alongside dark amalgam wheels, the bike additionally gets a reconsidered 3-step customizable back suspension. In principle, it should help in enhancing the ride nature of the bike. Different mechanical, in any case, stay unaltered. Driving the bike is the equivalent 124.9cc single-barrel motor, which produces 8.6ps of intensity at 6500rpm and 10.54nm of torque at 5000rpm. Braking obligations are as yet taken care of by a similar drum units on the two sides.

It basically satisfies all your needs expected from a 125cc scooter. The big bikers will surely turn their head when you cruise over them in traffic areas where it's not one-a-go with frequent gear shifting bikes. It depends upon a rider wish there.I regularly get 45km/l in city traffic conditions where u may get 50+ in highways. The minimum fuel of one litre(fuel indicator) should be maintained since its a fuel injection engine.Comparing other scooters in the range, honda really manages to provide better design especially to the front looks and automatic dual-led light headlamp setup along with two side light beam mimics the r15 in night time.I had two services since i bought bike in 6-7 months cost me around 850rs for only changing engine oil along with dye finish that makes look bike fresh new one.Honda service people are well responsive and kind. Maintenance looks free to own the scooter. The service time can be tracked via service booklet provided.I bought only drum variant as i didn't feel the need for disc brake.

Pros: it's good mileage, maintenance cost, metal body, parts are available anywhere, easy resale value, it can be used long term, big seat space.   cons: its seat height is not adjustable, the instrument cluster is not fully digital,      the rear tyre is small, the boot light and charging socket are missing, hazard light missing.

                            I bought honda activa 125 on last 22nd oct - activa is average - not good not bad - price is slightly higher - and dealer service is totally bad still reg pending. today is 20th Nov but I do not get any notification regarding registration. and head light is totally useless - it is LED but very low power LED s use in head light.                        ,Honda
"                            I am using honda activate since 2005. Now from last two months using activa 125. Following points observed while riding.1.Low mileage of 18 to 20 in city.2.Very poor shock absorber no change since 2005 (my old activa) 3.Very poor headlight same as my old activa.4.Bogus key too much long dicky not properly working.5.Chances of getting down at speed breaker as seat has no proper shape  by spending nearly about 90 thousand not satisfied. What your automobile engineers doing no change since 2005. You drive this vehicle on village road where lights are not you will find how your bike's headlight are  it seems very low. Try to change  shock absorber,head light, short key ,proper shape for seat.  Increase tank capacity.Only good pick up is not main issue.                        ",Honda

"                            Activa 125 Is The Best Model For Non Gear Since We Drive In City So Activa Is The Best I Advise You To Buy From My Experience Because I Am Getting A Good Mileage And The Looks Are Awesome Don't Think Too Much Because This Product Is Very Rare Mind 1 Thing Other Model, Non Gear Keeps Their Price Decreasing After The Launching After The Launch If The Price Is 70000 It Will Reduce To 60000-70000 But The Price Of Activa 125 Is The Same So,It Has A Unique Feature So Go For It..........

"                            I bought this scooter 1 year ago. Initially, the ride was comfortable. But later on, after about 10 months it becomes hard. Suspension is very bad. I suggest you take a motorbike instead of a scooter if you want a better suspension. So far I have ridden 4 company scooters but no scooters give the best suspension. To get the best suspension please always buy a motorbike not a scooter.                        ",Honda
"                            This scooter is good. It has a very smooth engine very well-refined pickup is also sufficient. I bought this scooter in 2021 January my luck is bad I got a defective piece. After 6 months I rode scooter in heavy rain and the next day I saw water play inside the metre and replaced the whole metre under warranty, at the 11th month I got a huge repair silencer broken out and activa became bullet. It cost me 15000.I still don't know the reason why the silencer had broken down fought a lot with management but a waste of time how much you ask they simply stood silent, it's waste of time and energy so I had no option and replaced with a new silencer which totally cost me 15k including labour charges. Completing 7 months post replacement now the same problem is repeated again there's a crack on your shaped part of the silencer again fought with management it is of no use. The complainant I observed in my scooter is to there's a bolt that attaches a silencer to the chamber that bolt used to frequently break down resulting in a crack on the silencer. Now to repair it I need to replace it with a new chamber and silencer which would cost me 25 thousand. Waste scooter waste is such garbage. Please check all parts before buying such a defective piece. My time has been wasted a lot roaming around the service centre.                        ",Honda

"                            1. Buying experience was bad. Because I feel this activa body is not good like activa 3g. This activa body is not strong if I compare it with activa 3g. I have already used activa 3g in 2015-2018.2. Riding experience is very good. It is comfortable. Good for a long journey. Rider and pillion both feel comfortable. The seating portion is large if I compare other scooties.3. Looks good. Performance is okay because I am getting checked engine light. Sometimes it appears and sometimes disappears automatically. I think the reason behind this is more sensors or fuel injection technology.4. I take service outside not the service center. Maintenance is low so easy to afford.5.

This problem came from day one - scooter delivery time itself, the same thing was told to the showroom person, they told that it will clear during 1st servicing time, but in every service time, told the same problem, but were unable to solve the problem in company showroom service centre.

Easy to ride and about look I rate -10/10 for amazing look and performance. Service makes perfect and low service charge .. This scooter is amazing and soft. I loved it and my experience is very good. And I say go for it without any doubt.                        ,Honda
                            The worst edition of honda activa..No place to hook a kit or bag..The two hooks provided are good for nothing.. The main issue is with the lock to open the storage area below the seat...Taken to the service center numerous times..If you are looking for the comfort of the old version...Don't go to buy a new honda activa..This is my third honda..Don't make your life miserable..                        ,Honda
                            Good bike for daily commuting but does not have proper looks or features and the spare doesn't feel the extreme quality and sometimes it has vibration on the handle Does not look very much appealingBut good for some old age peopleAnd it. Is very comfortable but the speedometer is outdated and it does not have any unique features we compare in the market overall justify the price you pay thus I think if you want a sober-looking scooter definitely go for it.                        ,Honda

My activa 125 getting noise on normal rods compared to my old access 125 . I think honda company will take a decision on this noise getting from body frames4. Fuel system it's useless in this vehicle because the fuel door getting more noise on riding, In my opinion bottom of the seat is better compared to the new one.                        ",Honda

"                            Buying experience was quite good and hassle-free . Bought the drum variant from an authorized Honda showroom .You do not have to bear any waiting period in most of the cases. Just go and you'll get the scooter on the same day.Coming to the riding experience i can assure you that this is the smoothest 125 cc scooter currently available in the indian market .No other scooter can give you such levels of engine refinement. Completely zero vibrations up to 60 km per hour. You might feel very low vibrations post 60 km per hour but those are also very well maintained. You can easily cruise at 60 to 70 km per hour on open highways ;post 70 km per hour the engine feels stressed. But after all this scooter is not made for highway riding. It is made for daily commuting and it does this quite well without any complaints. Talking about the looks the scooter looks clean and the build quality of the scooter is also excellent thus providing a premium feel. The scooter is also quite comfortable for both city and highway rides . You get ample space on footboard and the seat is also will cushioned. Underset storage is decent you can easily keep one medium sized full face helmet in it.  The suspension is also well maintained and thus does a good job in absorbing bumps and potholes in the cities.Coming to the performance it has decent performance for daily city use and occasional highway use. Throttle response is very crisp because of the fuel injection. On highways you can easily get above 52 km/l and the city you can easily expect something between 45 to 50 km/l.Servicing and maintenance cost is also well priced and as it is an activa you can get its parts and components everywhere in India.Pros- very refined and smooth engine ,excellent build quality, comfortable for commuting. Cons-not suitable for highway riding,  disc variant is quite expensive, the halogen headlamp of the drum variant is weak.After all if you want a 125 cc scooter which will use for daily commuting and occasional highway ride then activa 125 should definitely be considered                        ",Honda

"                            Best part about this scooty is that anyone in your family can ride it unlike a motorbike. There are few pro strains & constrains i have observed in this product which is mentioned below:Pro strains:-* easy to handle - as this two wheeler is made for every one it is really easy to handle even in the most difficult twists & turns .* great mileage - although company claims that it will give you a satisfactory mileage of 60 km/l but as per my experience i was able to get mileage up to 45 km/l even in worst scenario.* power - you can feel the difference if you have used any different vehicle in the same segment it is more powerful than any other scooty available in the market .* low maintenance cost - if you are using the vehicle on a daily basis in that case it is recommend that you should get it serviced at every 5000 kms but personally i never followed this rule i get the vehicle service every 5-6 months & its still running without any ongoing issues.*  design & durability - if you talk about the design company always made it very simple & appealing . This scooter is having all metal body making it more durable than any other contender available.* price - price is always a factor that always comes in our mind even when you are planning to buy any vehicle but the price is very competitive if you are going for this vehicle that will make you think twice before going for any other vehicle in the same class.* comfortable ride - it is a pleasure to ride this scooty when you are riding for hours even a pillion rider will feel the comfort.* unisex -this the best part about this vehicle that anyone in your family can ride it making it more efficient.* no shifting gears - sometimes shifting gears is a hassle & this can be avoided if you are riding this scooty.* good resale value - i bought for 56k ex showroom price & sold it after an year for 36k.What else do you expect out of this vehicle;)After using if for more than one year here is what i found was still missing in this amazing product from honda. Constraints:-* not available in 150-200cc segment   - although i found it easy  to ride even with 125cc engine but more cc would have made it more powerful.* suspensions are bit hard when you are riding it through the potholes.* tubeless tyres should have better grip on the road.I cannot think of anymore flaws, its better to go for this if you are in any dilemma. I am sure you will not regret it.Happy riding -  stay safe:)                        ",Honda

                            It is a great scooter/bike with heavy power to use in daily life. If you maintain it well then it will last for a long. The only con is that it gives lesser mileage as compared to other scooters as it is 125 cc. If you want a heavy-duty then you can go for it but if you are concerned about the mileage then I must say you can go for any other scooty with around 100 cc engine.                        ,Honda

"                            Buying experience: not so good. Was compelled to go for honda, since my previous activa broke down after 10 years and engine opening cost stood at mighty rs 5000. They instead gave an option for 5000 discount as exchange offer, which itself is ridiculous. Riding: one man riding is back breaking especially on bad road. Suspension setup is non existent for single as the riding posture and non existing weigh on back directly transfers all bumps and vibrations to your back. Riding on high speed too transfer all little bumps to our body. These are not the case for pillion at back, since there’s no upward flip from behind on bumps. Low speed power is low , mid range is fine, upper mid range is good. Can cruise at 60-70 without any issue. Can overtake sufficiently on those speeds. Speed tops out at around 80, although vibration above 75 makes going beyond unsafe and difficult. Have had very bad throttle issue recently due to jamming of petrol filter ,even on regular service.  Tank capacity: poor. Self start misses a lot. This might escalate with time. Service experience: not on par. If we leave it with them they will skip most maintenance and inner cleaning steps. Just surface job for customer appeasement. Obvious economy of scale issue. That’s what happen when they have so much sale and service numbers. Setting individual target for daily service mitigates the quality and forces the labor to skip major steps except where parts needs to be changed due to there previous carelessness. Looks: fine.                        ",Honda

Along with that service is also not good by the service center in Dehradun. The light should be replaced and should fall on the road, rather than on the bushes.

"                            Basically if you opt for a activa 6g series you will get kinda outdated in an year itself. Then activa 125 may be a pick for you, now it looks very modern, has got the extra power to for overtakes it's stable (also to glide at pretty high speed) much confident and featured as well. It won't even outdate as such and quality is actually quite premium so yes that won't be issue either (especially if you long-term user). Everyone in the family will like it for some reason or other. But this comes at a cost though. That's it in short. Point wise: Buying experience is descent , but you can not get much discounts prices are standard . The base model itself is quite equipped it literally has everything except alloy wheels and front disk brake. You got command . The ride quality as mentioned is phenomenal also seat is wide and comfortable it maintains it's balance won't even slip on wet roads either. It looks quite modern, got led treatment, digital mid , it isn't anyway controversial everybody in the family will like something or other while it retains activa vibes. I won't comment on service it depends on your local dealership but there wasn't any issue with from day 1.Pros :* got the power, more than sufficient for daily commute*metal build , nice paint quality .*looks modern, keeps trending no 6,7,8...G ssss* reliable and featured enough , peace of mind well contained. Cons:* comes at cost ,which is just fair.( lost a star for same)*the space at front not the leg room but to carry extra load is little less.* mileage is little on lower side although bs6 being more efficient bridges the gap. Verdict :If you're budget allows just go for it. While it very well balanced package.                        ",Honda

Honda Activa 125 features an idle stop and start capability with a light throttle. It's extremely useful. Two appealing aspects are the silent start and the inability to start without the side stand-up. A bonus is that digital trip metres and watches are available. The load-carrying capability and acceleration pick-up are both excellent. I love the Honda Activa 125 overall performance.

Final words hi people, i am sharing my feedback for this bike as no one trust activa  in terms of quality or technology at-least i can say that i was not having a good faith on activa brand and trust me before going for this bike i was also confused whether i should go for it or not as i have also seen many negative review for activa.I have purchased this activa of month back just for one thing thatis to get maximum mileage as i have daily run of approx 70km per day, trust me it delivers what i expected for activa as claims an mileage of 86 kmpl,Over all its a excellent bike under 125cc segment, no complaints so far, looks,features, performance, reliability all up to my expectation. Getting a mileage of approx 70-75 kmpl under riding conditions of not more than 60km per hour, maintaining an average speed of 50-55 km per hour.Extremely satisfied and recommend every one if they are planning for a bike under 125 cc tag.Areas of improvement it would have been a more joyful ride if  provide disc brake as well.Graphics, designs, everything good.

Riding experience: this scooter is not so fun to drive one - however it just meets the short distance commuting requirement, seat cushion is good, but rear shock absorber is very stiff and did not absorb Indian road kind of potholes &  sharp bumps which generally spoils comfort in driving3. Looks good, aggressive styling, moderate pick-up, braking is okay, zero self-starter noise is really noteworthy, user-friendly display console, headlight illumination is excellent, vibrations can be felt on both hands & foot, however, i feel those may not bother much.4.

I still won't be able to ride a cycle. I started learning to ride this activa mostly by myself. I actually bought it for my better half. But she met with a small accident and never drove it. So, i gathered all my courage and started driving it.  It actually took me only 3/4 days to learn how to drive. It's that simple. Now it's above 6 years and i still love it. I go to work on this scooter and the ride quality is great. Being an old scooter, mileage is not that great but it's manageable. For me, within or outside city it gives mileage of around 46 kmpl.  I even drove on highway and it's good there too.  But at 75 kmph with some wind it's a bit shaky. I bought it for rs. 60000 all inclusive in west bengal. After the initial servicing for about a year, i usually go for servicing once or twice a year only and it costs me around rs. 700 per servicing.  The best thing about honda activa is it's robust engine.  I have even seen people who have   driven activa for more than 10 years and 60000 km plus.I will advice anyone to buy honda activa without any doubt for tension free rides.

"My buying experience was very smooth as my preferred model was available on shelf.

Timely engine oil change once you rode much of the kilometers and keeping your lovely activa clean will be enough. According to me is that i have already explained before. Just love it, when you driving activa, you will experience like you have the best scooty in the world. It will give you a boost to your morale and your attitude will also be high.

Performance: the main highlight of the new honda activa 125 is the bs6-compliant 124cc engine which produces 8.1bhp.Honda has always been ahead of the curve when it comes to adhering to the ever-changing automobile laws of our country. Not surprising then, the honda activa 125 became the first bs6 two-wheeler in India. It comes with a whole host of updates, most of which aren’t visible to the naked eye.

"                            The only thing that is in your mind is engine quality and resale value then you should definitely look for this scooter. Rather if you are looking for an all rounder don't even think of this. The plastic quality , paint quality, headlight throw, starter, etc are below average. The styling of the vehicle is also very much dated. But i think the newer model (bs6) is a kind of different world situation. There is more features, better styling and all..

"                            Best part about this scooty is that anyone in your family can ride it unlike a motorbike. There are few pro strains & constrains i have observed in this product which is mentioned below:Pro strains:-* easy to handle - as this two wheeler is made for every one it is really easy to handle even in the most difficult twists & turns .* great mileage - although company claims that it will give you a satisfactory mileage of 60 km/l but as per my experience i was able to get mileage up to 45 km/l even in worst scenario.* power - you can feel the difference if you have used any different vehicle in the same segment it is more powerful than any other scooty available in the market .* low maintenance cost - if you are using the vehicle on a daily basis in that case it is recommend that you should get it serviced at every 5000 kms but personally i never followed this rule i get the vehicle service every 5-6 months & its still running without any ongoing issues.*  design & durability - if you talk about the design company always made it very simple & appealing . This scooter is having all metal body making it more durable than any other contender available.* price - price is always a factor that always comes in our mind even when you are planning to buy any vehicle but the price is very competitive if you are going for this vehicle that will make you think twice before going for any other vehicle in the same class.* comfortable ride - it is a pleasure to ride this scooty when you are riding for hours even a pillion rider will feel the comfort.* unisex -this the best part about this vehicle that anyone in your family can ride it making it more efficient.* no shifting gears - sometimes shifting gears is a hassle & this can be avoided if you are riding this scooty.* good resale value - i bought for 56k ex showroom price & sold it after an year for 36k.What else do you expect out of this vehicle;)After using if for more than one year here is what i found was still missing in this amazing product from honda.Constraints:-* not available in 150-200cc segment   - although i found it easy  to ride even with 125cc engine but more cc would have made it more powerful.* suspensions are bit hard when you are riding it through the potholes.* tubeless tires should have better grip on the road.I cannot think of anymore flaws, its better to go for this if you are in any dilemma. I am sure you will not regret it.....                        ",Honda

I have used it for almost every purpose, whether it was going on a leisure trip a long trip or on a daily basis.

"                            No other personal mode of transport offers quite the same amount of relief that automatic scooters do, when commuting in the city. They blend in and help negotiate aggressive traffic with relative ease and without driving up your fuel bills. We've had the honda activa 125 for some time now and I've been using it quite regularly within the city as well as for the occasional trip out. Here's how it's performed so far.At first glance, the activa 125 is similar to its older stablemate, albeit with an added dose of attractive styling, helping it stay appealing to a wide, diverse audience. Chrome touches up front and smoothly flowing lines are inspired by honda's current crop of larger bikes. Bits like the 125’s functional mirrors, decent quality palm grips and nice brake control levers lend the activa 125 a polished feel; expected of a comfortable automatic scooter from the big h. The digi-analogue display is clearly legible on the go, and the activa 125’s headlight does a good job of illuminating the road ahead when riding through an inky night. The lack of a rear brake lock clamp, however, did sometimes compromise my desired parking spots and honda would have done well to include this feature on the premium activa 125. Like most automatic scooters, the activa 125 idles silently, with minimum vibrations. But to start the scooter, the left brake lever needs to be pulled in really hard and almost all the way back to the handlebar, which is sure to be an irritant for some riders, and makes life very difficult for members of the fairer sex. Also, the choke lever could do with freer action here, as this proved sticky early in its life, and required lubrication a couple of times.Once on the go, the activa 125’s light throttle is a delight to use, and the user friendly scooter darts in and out of gaps in traffic effortlessly. It’s not just the engine power output that is impressive, but the urgency with which it responds at low revs, making for a tension-free ride, every time. The activa 125 has successfully made my life easier in these past few months, making travelling in the city quite effortless and comfortable. Thanks to the new het technology that aims to increase efficiency and enhance power, the new activa 125 feels peppier yet dishes out just as good mileage figures as the conventional 109.2cc activa, of around an impressive overall 45kpl. Living with the honda activa 125 over the past few months has us convinced this is a perfect example of a good, upmarket automatic scooter that makes good sense if looking for urban commuting, which is simple, reliable and thoroughly hassle free.

                            Overall i have drove the scooter for 2 years i am so much satisfied with the engine performance.When i drive it in nh it goes very smooth without any engine noise and i get good mileage in the economy speed.It ask for the less maintenance if you put engine oil and gear oil at the right time which is at the interval of every 3000 km.                        ,Honda

Buying experience is not great you need wait two weeks for number plate  and service is horrible not even cleaning done properly. product is good and start stop works really well. honda showrooms are like some government office only, their honda needs to improve a lot.

Talking about its pick up power it's really nice. The scooty gives you a stylish look when u ride it. Mileage is around 42-45.

"                            In the saturated world of scooters, i was completely lost. I had a very hard time deciding which one to buy. After various research and analysis, i decided to go for honda activa 125.I would like to start from the buying experience as that's the start. I bought my scooter from shah honda, kolkata. The executive was very friendly and guided me with the whole buying process properly. She also helped me to get a finance quote. However i changed my mind to buy it in full. 100% satisfied with buying process. Looks & durability: first thing first is the durability. The metal structure gives double plus points when compared to other scooters available in market. The metallic midnight blue colour is good and perfect for those who is not looking for too much style statement. I bought it for regular commute and the look is very official, nothing fancy, just what i was looking for.First ride review: initially i was taken aback with little bit rough suspension ride but once i took the accelerator control properly, i found the smoothest ride i ever had. After that i never had that first rough suspension issue. Maybe i was wrong or maybe first ride was like that only. Now my ride experience is very good and got better with first free service.Mileage: my average mileage is around 46-47 kmpl in normal city road condition. After 1st service the mileage got little better around 49 kmpl. But the above-said average is what i am getting.Servicing: shah honda service centre is good. Despite small space, they are working diligently to make sure the vehicles are properly taken care of. Please note the first service is free but you have to pay for parts & engine oil, when required. Best thing would be to buy a pressure nozzle and do a complete water wash with car shampoo like 3m or motomax periodically. Then apply a small coat of bike wax and polish it nicely. You scooter will be brand new every time. One thing- make sure to ask them to service the brakes, as once asked they did tighten up the brake system a little bit. Usually it is on a looser side when you get it from the showroom. Also make sure to book slot one day before you plan to visit; that will save your time. Saturday & sundays are rush so if you are planning on weekend visit, keep a good amount of time free and visit early around 8-8:30 am.Pros: all mentioned above.Cons: only thing i didn't like that there is no indicator buzzer. It is not available with honda and you have to get an aftermarket product to get that beeping.                        ",Honda
                            It is very good for city rides compared to 5g standard versions this is will give low fuel efficiency but bike control is good compared to 5g as 5g is having less weight while we jumping in speed breakers 5g shakes a big but 125 version have control over there and pick up also very good and services center are good somewhere average.                        ,Honda

"                            I was so excited to purchase the new activa 125. I bought it after making a good searching about other bikes in its segment from other rivals like suzuki, yamaha, tvs etc. And i have test driven all those bikes and i finalised activa as my bike of the dream. My uncle is using the normal activa and its a 2010 model and its still a great and one of my friends father is owning an activa and its somewhat around 14 years old or more ,that is the main reason why i bought this bike because of its reliability and durability. From the first time i took it for a test ride i was in love with this bike, its telescopic suspension and wide seating was so satisfying. I drove it on gravel road as well as plain road, the comfort it gives to the rider is great. And comparing with its rivals i felt more connection with this bike because of its legacy in indian roads and its ride comfort as well as performance. For me the look of activa 125 is a love at first site. So now i have told some pros. Now let's talk about the cons it has, sometimes when we try to take this bike from a stand still there will be a time that we may feel that the power is not enough. It was felt when i try to accelerate it from a very sloppy humb. I needed to steer away from that humb to go past it and in our country those kind of humps and potholes are very common. The main reason i bought the activa 125 instead of normal activa is to solve this issue thinking that more power will help to solve this problem but i couldn't feel the pick up of the bike from a stand still is not as satisfying as i expected but it beats normal activa in all other fields with great margin. I am going to have my first free service on 30th of this month and until now i haven't had any quality issues with bike. It feels sturdy and feels good in the hand. The plastics and metals that the bike is made of good materials and are a satisfying thing to watch. The mileage that i observed is ranging between 45-50 kmpl which is a decent one, but i am pretty sure that it will rise a bit more after a 2000km plus range of running.

                            - they are charging more for extra fittings. Because they never include many items on basic price- smooth experience. Never see any vibration.- looks and performance vise super.- servicing charge is little bit high. Changing oil on time is mandatory.- smooth in driving. Performance wise good and also having better storage place. So that we can store many place on the go.                        ,Honda
                            Honda activa 125 since 2017 i bought this for my daily uses and its really good performer and its looking very good and its 125 cc scooty if u try to go hill local hills its can go.. And its miles about 40 to 50 not give u 60 kmpl..  If u from siliguri u go with this scooty to mirik and doesn't complain any issue.. Their two tyre tubeless then u got extra safety..

"                            I have a purchase a honda xblade since 11 month ago now i have facing a serious problem in my bike, when i am accelerating my x blade in 3rd and mainly 4th or 5th gear starting from 40 km/hour and upto 55 km/hour speed, my bike is not taking acceleration smoothly and the speed is fluctuating to a remarkable extent. And when i drive my x blade above 55km/hour (for example like 60 or 65 km/hour speed) steadily then also the speed is fluctuating, i am very much worried about this problem. Surprisingly honda service center unable to solve this problem.                        ",Honda
"                            Gear shift problem, Engine heating, at 70 kmph lot of engine noise. Feel no engine refinement as car & bikes blogs describe Honda refine engine. All three services are done but service center helpless. Purchase this bike over Yamaha FZ now I think it was my wrong decision. But bike mileage is good, giving me 55 - 58 kmpl.                        ",Honda
"                            I don't own this bike, but my friend have owned this bike. Bike is very smooth to drive and have a great mileage. A good bike with wonderful specs i loved it.If you are looking for a bike to use for all your needs don't miss this bike it has a good mileage i am sure you won't lose your money by buying the bike.                        ",Honda
                            Everyone facing the same gear box issues and even riding comfort was not up to the mark ... While riding getting wrist pain occasionally..... Totally not satisfied with the bike ... Only the reasons to buy this bike is its from honda but it’s big disappointment... Even handle was too tight initially later service they have changed the settings now it’s better..                        ,Honda
"                            I am riding this bike on regular basis from last 1 year, almost completed around 9000 km. The look is aggressive and eye catching.This bike has the mileage of 55 to 60 km.Led light and robo design is also awesome. Servicing and maintenance is normal.I faced one issue that in some situation the gear shifting will not work properly neither down or to up. This is the issue which honda needs to look into it.                        ",Honda
                            Very good in look and pickup. 48km/l from a 160 cc bike is awesome. Gear change is not free and is not resolved even in 1st service. No extra fitting items even in showrooms of cities like hyderabad is a bit disappointed.Brand honda stays at its own level by this engine and strength of its body. Servicing need to improve at least in famous showrooms/servicing centers. Awesome robotic look of head light has not disappointed with focus of light.                        ,Honda
"                            1. The bike was delivered to me very soon and the service of the bike also good 2. Riding the bike is so passionate and smooth drive 3. It looks almost like a ninja and performance is next level 4. Servicing and maintenance doesn't cost much it's all budget friendly. 5. Pros - looks, lamps, speed. cons - mileage.                        ",Honda
"                            Buying experience is really good.When you ride for the first time you feel it .  It feels amazing to have people's eye on your bike when you go on ride. It's looks are really amazing especially the tail back-light, broad tyres make it ride stable . Pickup is pretty good but cannot go beyond 128 kmph .                        ",Honda
                            My honda xblade i had owned 1 year ago and it has a very amazing monster look style and also my bike is having very high riding performance with very efficient mileage of above 55kmpl with stunning displacement of 162.71 cc. With my feel many youngster girls love the look and style of my bike they also love to travel in it.                        ,Honda
"                            I bought this bike 1 year ago. It's very smooth bike for riding, you'll never feel back pain while long ride. Smooth gear shifting. It have a stunning look from front and like a razor from side. For first few months i got 50 above mileage, now i'm constantly getting 60kmpl mileage. We can easily clean every part of this bike, easier maintenance for users. The low maintenance sealed chain can be effortlessly cleaned and apply chain lubricants.Pros: wide seat, better mileage, easy maintenance, fully digital console, bright headlight. Cons: low starting torque, the brighter digital console feels strain on eyes while night riding (apply films if you want).                        ",Honda
"                            A amazing look and comfort riding also having digital meter 2. Good mileage as 50 km per litre 3.Within budget 4.A stylish look 5. Comfortable sitting 6. Headlamp is looking as alien face 7.Front look is feeling awesome Cons, 1.Not provided engine kill switch 2. Need to provide rear disk also 3. Need to increase torque power as compared to different segments of bikes 4.Need to give engine cover to free from mod.                        ",Honda
                            This motorcycle  looking so gorgeous that i cannot explain it with a small words. Its red colour looking very attractive feature. I gives very smooth riding when driving it goes accelerating so smooth. The value of this motorcycle is very low in front of  its style and its different colours. This motorcycle is so gorgeous....                        ,Honda
                            For long distance this bike very good. There have no any problem. Its very smooth. Its given good mileage not ever seen in 160cc. I really like it. I fully satisfied for this bike. Its very comfort for riding. This bike is very best for anyone who want to buy it. I & my friend also buy this. I used 5 month there have no any problem.                        ,Honda

"                            Really happy and proud of my bike. 6 months done. Completed second service.I have done 600 kms recently, at 80 - 90 speeds @ 50 kmpl.If maintained 60 to 70 kmph it gives 55 plus mileage. City mileage is 45 to 50 kmpl with slight aggressive riding style. Not much negative points as i knew all about the shortcomings compared to other rivals. My reasons to purchase this bike Seating (pillion also comfortable) Tank doesn't stress groin area Led lights are powerful (done 300 kms night ride with one break at 85 kmph, good visibility) City handling and turning radius Highway ride also stable at high speeds Breaking is good for me (no abs still im confident as per my riding style)Gear indicator (also helped in few occasions to correct half gearing)Speedo has clear visibility Price  - 1 lakh on road Stylish bike, lot of people give a second look or stare at it matte green.                        ",Honda
"                            I bought this bike from a subdealer of dugar honda. Sales people are very knowledgeable.At very beginning it had gear shifting issue but after 1st service it is getting smoother and after 2nd service i'm experiencing the smoothest refined engine of honda. And no more gear issue. I recommend you to use shell fully synthetic 10w40 engine oil. As far as performance is concerned i cruise this bike at 80kmph for hours. Despite of having air cooled engine it doesn't over heat. Bike is quite torquey from low to mid range. It looks good, headlight looks killer but beam is not strong enough for night ride. No engine kill switch but i am used to with it. Rear tyre is wide enough for cornering but but front tyre is little skinny for better mileage (50+ kmpl in ideal condition), seat is somewhat comfortable for both rider and pillion. Handling is  is good but turning radius is little wide, sitting position is semi upright. No vibration even at high rpm. Brakes and abs work perfectly. Service cost is not high but parts are not as cheap as hero and bajaj. It is overall a great commuter as well as touring bike.                        ",Honda
"                            Superb bike for me this bike design,mileage, maintenance etc. The whole specification is superb. X balde mileage is 55+, & this bike sitting position is comfort, head-light is led light, disc break with abs system. Overall this bike very good for all people who need daily work, for tour, for long drive etc.                        ",Honda

I take care of it. * i wash it every week.* i think that it is a good bike for daily use purpose.* it gives good average also about 55km.                        ",Honda
                            Awesome bike .Best handling .The pickup is very high and it has very high acceleration .I have the blue colour bike that looks extremely cool on it and it's sporty looks and the robot face like headlamps make it look like a transformer. The headlamps give project a t when you apply brakes and the dual silencers give it an awesome sound . This bike is worth more than it's value.

Its performance is very good as it has a very good pick up at lower speed also. I have gone to Long trips , Did not get any back pain as riding position is awesome. Initially I have faced Gear shifting problem which switching Gear from 4 to 5 or ,5 to 4.

"                            I bought honda xblade abs in "" the noble honda-erode"" and i am having ""pearl spartan red"" colour. Riding:1. Riding is too smooth, so comfortable 2. My top speed 1353. Igot mileage of about 50+ in city and    in highways         *60/60+kmpl at 60-70kmph *50kmpl at 90kmph *35-40kmpl at 100-110kmph4. Very good in both onroad an offroad riding5. No pain seen in long trips and really i want to say no tiredness during long trips.6. Sound is too low7. The monoshock suspension does its great work.Looks and performance:1. I think this is the best looking in 160cc segment bike comparing to all other 160cc bikes 2. Performance is very good and more than new model hornets3. The led headlight is more bright in night rides 4. Braking really awesome...    may the rear brake is drum, but it's braking performance really up to the mark.5. The back light t-shape lamp is attractive even when i see at other xblade bike riders 6. Looking too sharp edges giving more attractive appearance. Extra fitting are good.7. Digital metre is very clear in day light and it shows gear indicator, rpm, time ,and also they had given 3 trip metres 8. Seeing petal disc too good9. Dual splitted outlet looking great and the sound created in the outlet is different and i liked that sound.10. Rider can notice that near your thigh there is a noticeable fitting in bike. That is very helpful.11. The front wheel may look small 80/100 but it's not a matter, performing good and it is acceptable look Service and maintenance: 1. I had finished 2 services and centres are very respectful and too responsible.2. As i am having pearl colour, the dust will be seen after every ride. I just clean in within minutes. And please clean your xblade everyday so that it looks more eye catchy in front of other bikes.3. Don't let your bike in sunlight.4. Air cooling system superb: first up to 5 or 6 km engine heat will seen after air cooling system does its job well.5. Just leave a small gap during long trips in each 60km interval. Pros:1. Mileage2. Pickup3. Best for trips n commuting4. Abs (compared with other bikes and i am giving 5/5)5.Turnings and u-turns is very easy6. Presence of hazard switchCons: 1. No kill switch2. No rear disc ( for those who are seeing disc, but drum is nearly performing well)3.

The vehicle has been delivered within two days when i handed over the papers. i have completed 1500 kilometers till now. First service completed. At first i thought  whether it is suitable for me because i am 45 years old. Honda itself climate that the vehicle is for  youth. But when i used i feel very comfortable and affordable for daily use. I ride  the vehicle around hundred kilometers everyday. It gives around 60km mileage. it's look is very sporty and catches attention of every one. Digital meter is awesome everything we needed is included in it especially service indicated. i feel everything pros and seems nothing cons.

During up shift above three, you have to work hard with toe, but still its neutral, when you release the clutch and bike goes it automatically falls in the gear with a forward jerk.

"                            1. Buying experience was not bad but average. Xblade is great bike no issues but showroom's lower level working people were not good at all in my city. 2. Riding experience is excellent. No any issue at all. Best part is it's speedometer and it's bright white led headlight. No battery issues at all.3. Looks are awesome. It's robo face headlight( i think it's more similar to predator's face).. Tail light.. And white backlit speedometer with gear position indicator. More good is its font in speedometer, its biggest in every bike available in Indian market. Easily readable in every condition.4.No servicing or maintenance issues. Cover the bike every time when not in use. Wash the bike properly. Bring company's original accessories. Get matte color for zero dust scratches.5.Pros - headlight, speedometer, tail light, seating position, exhaust sound (double barrel).    cons - little bit vibrations on right hand side handle bar and on right side turn indicator. Seat cushioning is not that great so soft padding seat cover is must. False neutral indicator.                        ",Honda

Engine Fluctuating(like there is no petrol) while am driving around 45-50km..i took to service centre and the guys over there said they have to look in to it as it is new bike and they weren't aware of this complaint as it's new to them.. So they said they need some time around 3 days.. After 3 days they called me and said that they have rectified the problem by cleaning Carburetor.. I test drive it.. But it is not fully rectified.. Still am facing the problem.. I said to that service manager and they said they will look in to it and said me to drive for one week and come if you still facing the issue.. So my request for new buyers is to check the vehicle that you select.. Drive it and see.. because Buying a faulty bike hurts a lot.. Bike is super smooth.. Pick up lags little, Strong mid range, Gear problem, but it can rectified.. Comfortable for Tall riders..                        ",Honda

Has a clock, 2 trip-meters, gear position indicator and service reminder.> engine has good bottom-end torque (unlike previous-gen hornet) which enhances the city drive-ability.> although not completely vibe-free, the engine is quite refined and revs freely. Overall engine performance is quite good. I was able to reach top speed of ~ 115-120 kmph on a straight road without incline/decline.> gear change mechanism is effortless and the clutch is light as well.> manoeuvrability in city traffic is amazing due to light handlebar.> high speed stability is satisfactory.Cons-> false neutrals near 4th gear.> front tyre is 80 section which is not good for cornering. Front end feel is lacking in this bike due to this skinny tyre. I changed the tyre to 90/90 r17 and the front end feel has improved a lot now.

In my own experience sad to say that honda's xblade performance is not up to the mark. because lot of vibrations comes after cruising 65km in the bike. The bike is very rugged not smooth to ride which is not to be expected in honda. And major disadvantage is wide handle bar so after few mins your shoulder will start to catch up and gear shifting is completely vigorous and brakes are not proper ,getting skidded many times I'm just 24, and according to my age group i will not recommend to anyone to get this bike rather we can go for fz or rtr 160.

The pick up is very satisfying and cursing through the highways is super fun, I started loving my xblade even more as time passed by. It has a futuristic look, robo-faced led lamp, many people actually stare at me, giving me some good attention though I don't need it.

"                            My buying experience of honda x-blade is memorable because my dear one was with me while taking the delivery of the bike at bimal Honda, Adabari, Guwahati. I suggest every buyer bring their loved ones and family to the showrooms.  Let everyone share the same joy you experience while taking your new bike.Riding experience is exceptional, coming from an older bike Honda feels like leaps ahead. The suspension is great transmission feels amazing.I am happy with the way it looks, this is subject to personal choice. I like it it's like ktm adventure and tvs apache in my perspective. Performance-wise all I can say is if you need fancy sensors and power then look for other options. And if you are looking to commit to one bike for a longer run, trust me you can't go wrong with Honda. Servicing cost and maintenance are reasonable. I never took care of my older bike and it was not adequate. Every being living or not needs maintenance and services for optimal performance. Pros about Honda x-blade seat is bigger which is better! and once you ride a honda machine you will advocate its mechanism just like every Honda owner. Cons- Tyre size is leaner. Maybe the engineers have thought of something. Which is not advertised. Anyway, i don't feel that's a con for the bike.                        ",Honda

"                            1. Buying experienceI bought it from cloud 9, madhyamgram. Delivery was prompt, no delay. There were merely any discount. (in covid times, 2 wheeler brands in most of cases didn't proposed any offer).2.Riding experienceI had a discover 125 before. So at first ride the vehicle felt very bulky. This bike is 7 kilo more heavy than yamaha fzs. I am 5.2 feet, and with straight handles i felt a lot of pain in arms for starting few days. Then i ordered a handle raiser from amazon, after installing it, now it feels okay and i don't feel any stress in the arms. 3. Details about looks, performance etc.Bike is very stable, cornering feels confident. Honda engine is smooth, clutch is very light. Good for city traffics. Braking is also good. I have abs in front wheel. But at this price point drum brakes at rear is undermining and does not arise much confidence.Ride height is lower than other bikes in the segment so short height people like me can also ride the bike easily. Look wise it's very charismatic. The robo face front fascia looks awesome. Throttling and pickup is good but not aggressive. Easily touches 113-120 (absolutely not advised to ride at this speed) in highways.  It is a bs6 version and the fuel injection also works well. In about 18 months every time it started at first chance even in winters.Oil tank is huge in length and until you are 5.8 - 6 feet long and you have long hands it can be very problematic.4.Servicing and maintenanceDue to huge sale during covid times, most of the time i faced huge queue at service centers. If you don't plan well, you can easily ruin half of your day. Free services are ok. Nothing to do except washing and engine oil change. 5.Pros and consPros------1. Looks fantastic2. Reliable and smooth honda engine3. Light clutch4. Front abs5. Tubeless tires / fat tyre at rear so balance is very good.6. Fantastic rear mono suspension. 7. Has kick start option8. Mileage is very good (50km/l) in city is very good considering its 160cc9. Led panelCons---------1. No abs / disc at rear wheel at this price point (1.28l on road)2. Thin tyre at front (almost like a 125cc bike)3. Front suspension looks like a 125cc bike, needed to be more beefy to handle potholes. It also ruins the front look to a bit.4. Led light is absolute inefficient at night. Without extra fog lights can not drive at night.5.

"                            bought my xblade in December 2020, rode it around 5000 km on highways and in the city with low to high traffic. It is my daily commute which covers 32 km every day. At the end of the day, I am pretty satisfied and happy with my bike and its performance.Should you buy it or not.?Yes, absolutely if you are looking for the following:A 150-160 cc bike that you can rely on, every day. Honda's engines are reliable, I previously owned activa, for 6 years, used day-in-day-out without any single issue, apart from regular maintenance.Excellent mileage. I got 73 km/l a couple of times, believe me. I'm getting 50-57 km/l in the city with moderate to high traffic - of course, it depends on your driving style. I don't know any other bike like this in this segment that can even comes close to these figures, I also have a TVS Apache 200 4v bs4 that hardly gives me 39 km/l for my riding style.These are my fueling time stamps with odometer reading, see for yourself:Great suspension, you can easily ride through a decent-sized pothole without even recognizing it. Comfortable for pillion too. Ride quality is great.Smooth engine and gearbox. Very refined and smooth engine, no vibrations generally, very little vibrations even at 102 km/h  (that's the maximum that i have gone). The gearbox is also smooth for quick shifting in the city. The clutch is very light, i am really impressed with the clutch. Breaks are also great, i had some close calls where single-channel abs was helpful. (it would be great if Honda had given dual-channel abs or at least combi-braking)Now, no bike is perfect and it is the same with honda xblade as well. The most significant con is its price, 1.13 lakhs ex-showroom price for a dual disc is a little high compared to the competition, but I decided to pay that price for its mileage, comfort, and reliability. Dual-channel abs or combi-braking might have justified the price.Looks: xblade is a sharp-looking bike, you will like it or not, simple. It doesn't sit on a balance like a pulsar 150 (which is neither sporty nor conventional - it's a balance)Power: every other bike in this segment offers more power than xblade which is 13.9 ps (except fzs-v3, i think). So if you go by the specs and are one of the people who think that power matters, xblade might not appeal to you (I rarely used 17 ps of power on my apache 200 4v bs4). But it offers more torque 14.8 nm, which is important than power for daily use in the city for the commute.Service and spares: I will be straight, Honda's service is good, I didn't face any issues with the sale or service till now. But you might have to wait a long time for spare parts which are not immediately available (because of the low sales figure)For those who are confused between unicorn bs6 and xblade bs6:Both the bikes use the same engine. But power and torque have been tuned differently. Xblade offers more power and torque than unicorn bs6.xblade comes with a rear-wheel of 130/70 profile so that you can be more confident in the corners.Unicorn bs6 comes with a more conventional look and design (even the dash is in analog), xblade comes with a fully digital dashboard. Unicorn bs6 offers a longer seat and a negligible step-up.My final take is, xblade might not be as good as other bikes (with more power) in the segment when you are looking for sheer power. But for an average rider who wants a daily commuter that doesn't hurt his pocket (i'm talking about fuel) and looks sharp, xblade might be the choice. I will take my xblade rather than my apache on any regular day without any second thought.This review might be lengthy, i tried to cover most of the aspects. I do love riding bikes, not fast though, when you are fast you are in an adrenaline rush (most of the time), when you are slow you are yourself by all senses, that's the way i like it.Thank you.

                            Travelled around 3k. Worth to buy. Pros :1. Good mileage around 60km/ltr.2. Good pickup and smooth engine.3. Superb road grip.4. Awesome look and no back pain after ride 300km in a day. Easy handling in city traffic.Con :1. No engine kill switch 2. No rear disc. But not bad with existing drum brake in normal speed.3. Seat is very hard. Can't sit more than 100km without stop.4. Average headlamp brightness.                        ,Honda

                            This bike is not at all good very less pickup in 160cc segment. if you are planning to get a bike go for FZ this is not at all value for money.

Never been a fan of honda.I had owned bajaj pulsar 150 before this one, this one is great in terms of handling and pickup. Engine is smooth as butter. Gear shifting is okay. Mileage is awesome - it gives around 45-50 at the average speed of 70-80km/h. Looks is great.

"                            To sum up, this is my first bike as a b'day gift from my dad. He researched a lot (without me knowing) and manage to filter some bikes for me. They were Suzuki's gixxer, Yamaha's fzs, honda cb hornet, and this(the xblade) .Long things short in the month of April i was surprised with this bike!Coming to the bike this is my first bike (but have rode some before) . I am totally satisfied with this . The looks are total head-turner and never left you unnoticed! performance wise , i don't know why, on paper its sounds utter disappointment , bit to the surprise, it is just as smooth as any other 160 cc bike. It manages to launch faster than gixxer (compared personally) though it is under-powered! But i never mind those numbers. one should always pick a test ride and then decide! The seats are comfortable.  gear shifts are smooth (sometimes i get false neutrals though) and have great maneuverabilityand never feels as heavy as it is on paper (140kg).I am totally satisfied with the kind of performance coupled with mileage( i am up for 150 kms on this bike and i am getting around 40 before 1st service) and Honda's unmatched service!

At-last i saw honda xblade and became fan of this bike. It was love at first sight. I am using this bike from 6 months and this bike has the best looks and best performance among all.

The riding experience is very poor, get ready for a lot of back pain and wrist pain. suspension and seats are not comfortable whatsoever even after continuous modifications and tuning done by technicians. Speaking of post purchase problems, it is very difficult to get accessories or any spare part for that matter, there is at least a week waiting time for everything.The bike's looks are very good and appealing, definitely a head turner, thanks to robot face headlamps. But really! don't fall for the looks. Everything else is disappointment in this bike.Fuel economy!!!, I live in an urban area, mixture of traffic and highways. Before purchasing this bike I did watch tons of youtube videos and reviews, everyone say the mileage is between 45 - 55kmpl. That is a lie, I do not even get 30kmpl, believe me have tried every possible solution.Gearbox, the worst I have seen ever, does not shifts smoothly, slips every-time and you just see a dash ""-"" like this on gear shift indicator.Brakes, I have encountered near death experiences several time despite my very safe riding. brakes are very weak even after getting it checked by honda mechanics. It just skids and skids and will only stop after it hits it target.Comfort, this is a stranger thing in this bike. If you hate someone just make them sit on the back of this bike and believe me that's a very great punishment.So these are everything, I have written this long review for any product in my life, but! this flop bike from honda deserves it.

Riding position is good but gear changing pedal is sporty and rear brake pedal brake is horizontal so u feel fatigue to right leg wen you ride it for longer time.. But i like this bike..

Getting mileage 45+ km in city.  Recently had a long drive of 450 km in highway, got mileage of 54 km, very smooth engine. Not faced any problem yet. Little hard shock absorbers, you can feel the jerk while solo riding but very comfortable with pillion. Lagging in rear brakes, could have improved with rear disc brake. My bike had a faulty digital console for which i was getting some electrical and starting problem initially, which was replaced by honda free of cost.. From then on facing no problem.

"                            1. Buyer experience was not good. Customer care and sales person were pathetic.  Test ride was not given properly... Once they allot one sales person, no other sales person helped me.. You need to wait for that person to come even if its for small inquiry.. Still i remember the buying experience when i bought my first bike apache and access. 2.  Great comfort. 3.  Astounding look. Especially the head and tail lamp. Only initial pickup the performance little lags but once you cross 3rd gear.. That will not be an issue.. Since it ramps up the speed.  4. Service is average.. When i told the service guy that after my first service, i am getting some noise from the engine.. He drove and said that it is not a problem, even in hornet the same sound comes.. Still that noise is coming even after 3rd service.. 5. Pro: stunning look... Comfort ride, mileage, spacious seat. Different look from other bikes. Cons: gear shift problem from 1 to 2 and 2 to neutral. Sometime from 2 to 1, it stucks in neutral. Engine gets sudden off even after running 4-5kms.. Rear braking average.

"                            Buying experience is very good, showroom manager and all other workers treated me very polite and kind. Riding in highway as well as in city traffic is amazing. Especially Highway stability is next level of experience for this 160cc commuter bike. Personally I am satisfied with it's look.Perfomance is awesome. Service cost is satisfied.1)Pros- Light weight, Good mileage, Maintenance cost low2)Cons- Honda has to improve power and torque.While comparing to other vehicles like NS 160, Apache 160 and etc., Atleast 15 bhp should want from Honda.",Honda
"                            The riding experience was good, but the pillion seating is quiet sliding and when downshifting the gear it's somewhat jerky not that smooth and the handle is quiet heavy for city commuting apart from that it's worth for money and the pickup is very good. The engine is more refined and its sharper looks are dazzling like a beast. If you want good sport bike in less cost prefer this.                        ",Honda
                            Good bike. I purchased bike about 2 months ago. It's comfortable and has good mileage. Bike's looks are very beautiful. Easy to handle. So far no problem. I travelled around 800 km. So far no issue. But in my bike i don't have engine hard . I switched out side not getting . In showroom it's costs about 800 rupees.                        ,Honda

Mileage upto 55 to 50km i suggest is bike all over perfect.. Maintenance is good.. Riding experience is impressive.. Bike head light is so cool. And impressive.                        ,Honda
                            I have ride this bike for 3 year and I have not spent a single penny on bike for repair because everything is fine after 3 year. I have only serviced this bike after every six month and it run well and good. I love this bike riding on highway because it is fast and its exhaust sound is very good to hear. I have ride till 115 km/hour and it is very smooth. It is best bike in his range price.                        ,Honda
                            I bought this bike on 2018 April. On that time x blade was just launched at market. I drive 14000km but now bikes chain need to be replace. Chain got issues & service center suggest me to replace chain sprocket. Its unbelievable that in just 14000km chain sprocket need to replace. Honda Please look into it.                        ,Honda

The best part were most of them expect is the mileage.Mileage is awesome, driving in city traffics.The seat comfort and the control of the bike is awesome.It has a wider handle bar and broad seats which we can see in activa or dio scooters.The pick up is awesome and i couldn't imagine the power it gives from 0-60 speed.As always not one look is enough.Awesome head lights & body structured.Negative part is gear shift is little harder(might be is 3 days older), rear number plate light(yellow bulb) were entire bike is having led lights,it looks awkward..Head light low beam light keeps burning all time if engine is on.Same for tail light.

"                            Buying experience at the honda (kondapur, hyderabad)was exceptional, warm welcome and explained the advantages, compared with hornet. Looks- it is sure class in the 160cc segment!! on traffic roads, this will be the centre of attraction, people literally stare.On the performance front, it is not on par with the previous cb unicorn 160 which had better mileage, but pick up and acceleration don't seem to vary much. Currently(4th day)after purchase, i am getting a mileage of around 45kms, which might increase after 1st servicing as i am a moderate speedster(avg of 60kmph only).Headlight and proper pillion seating are the highlights of this bike compared to any other 160cc bike. Waiting for my 1st service, hoping the positivity continues and this xblade continue to be amaze me and be my bestie on road.3 cheers to honda. Very good purchase and feel satisfied for now.                        ",Honda

Average mileage of bike is nearly 51.57km/ltr. 3 services are free with bike which exclude cost of engine oil that is u have to pay from your own pocket during oil change. Paint job is good but it get dull with time at the particular place where seat meet tank (maybe due to continuous frictioning between cloth and tank). Riding experience is good.

Maintenance is even negligible as compared to other bike of this segment, seat is quite broad & comfortable, led head lamp & tail lamp looks awesome & 4 indicator combine switching on is helpful.Only disadvantage i feel is about it's braking ( disc brakes are not good & even may cause the tyre to slip) it also varies bike to bike.

"                            Hi, i  bought xblade silver at bangalore sapphire honda near sarakki and i believe mine is first bike in bangalore. My experience is awesome. This bike is amazing in style and that led is just eye lock . If come to mileage am getting avg of  50kmpl in bnglr city before first service.

Engine is very smooth for riding. And pick up is not as good as other 150 cc bikes. You have gear shift for every chase or overtake or slow down. Main road experience is very good. Break could be more better. Led headlights are amazing for night driving.3. Look is amazing . Front headlamp looks like iron man head which is very attractive. I bought red colour. The xblade font on two sides of tank gives a sporty look. Back light is like t -shape.4.My 1st servicing experience was not  good. They changed my headlamp adjust. 2nd servicing was ok. About maintenance i feel it is ok , not as much as heavy or pricey but honda parts slightly pricey than hero.5.Pros-   led headlights   fully digital meter   break (abs)   engine smooth sound   cons-   no led indicator.   gear box not smooth   headlights connect with seat . You have adjust for single and for double clause wire.                        ",Honda

"                            The beautiful red x blade was delivered to my home by vahini honda since i could not visit the dealer on the date of promised delivery. It was delivered with necessary accessories fitted, genuine engine cover apart from helmet, rain coat, body cover, seat cover and an umbrella as a special monsoon offer, of course, all free of cost. They have given me a good discount on the on road price too. I rode the bike after three days of delivery. I am fully satisfied with its performance. Smooth 160 cc engine, easy 5 gear shifts (except some false neutrals), fuel tank shape, braking, overall pick up, robotic front, led head and park lamps, easy handling, road presence etc. Etc..... And to my surprise the mileage was better than i imagined. I got 58 km/l before its first service. And obviously the mileage is going to increase after every service. So its a recommended bike even for first time buyers. Xblade is young and its for the youth. I hope honda will win this time in this segment with xblade and going to fill the vacuum created by hornet.                        ",Honda

"                            I bought honda x-blade bike in jsp kukatpally, hyderabad showroom on 8th june, 2018, 1. Buying experience: overall buying experience was good. No issues from showroom.2. Riding experience: till now i rode 450 kilo meters in hyderabad city. I covered all type of road and traffic situations.  Observed that gears are not that much smooth while changing, some times getting stuck between 2 gears. And front suspensions are not that much smooth and not as expected, rear mono suspension is good. This bike is suitable for guys who's height is at least more than 5 feet 8 inch.  3. Details about looks and performance: look wise excellent, the caption ""one look is enough"" is perfectly apt for this bike. Performance like pickup is not as expected, it should be better as is 160 cc bike. Engine sound is very smooth while riding the bike. Very good balance when applying front disk brake. I am very very disappointed about the mileage, because it is giving exactly 30 kmpl which is not expected, i have checked the mileage thrice, i was expected more than 40 kmpl before purchasing the bike as it is 160 cc bike. I am expecting at least more than 40kmpl after my first service.4. Servicing and maintenance: till now i didn't get any issues, next week i am giving it for my 1st service.5. Pros and cons:        pros: look and design, fully electronic dashboard, gear indicator etc. cons: mileage, pick up,  gear shifting, no engine kill switch, no footrest for one side sitting ladies.

Seat is well cushioned and very comfortable. Bright speedometer display. Build quality is good.Cons: should have option of rear disc and cbs atleast.

"                            Well, it's been more than 6 months living with this motorcycle and I am having a love-hate relationship with it to be honest.  I purchased it from Honda Bigwing Ghaziabad and my buying experience was butter smooth. Credits to the Bigwing Ghaziabad Team for that.  The motorcycle looks decently good - passively aggressive and I love it that way. Although it resembles Hornet 2.0 to some extent, this motorcycle has its own charm. It rides amazing with comfortable riding posture and the gearshifts are butter smooth.  Tyres offer adequate grip and gives you confidence. Now the cons and I have a lot to share. The first thing is the build quality. I am not sure what Honda was planning. The bike is all plastic (read cheap quality plastic) with horrendous fit and finish. I say 'Horrendous' because it stands nowhere close if we compare it with KTMs and modern REs. The shrouds on the tank is very delicate. The clutch lever (although it has slipper clutch) is feeble with too much of free-play. Also,  the vibrations on handlebars and foot-pegs at  > 6000 RPM is something that irritates you but you have to live with it. Rear brakes lack the bite but after riding for around 6000 KMs,  I am used to it.  Also, since the bike is very light in weight, it is not very stable at high speeds. I am not complaining about engine specifications and performance, but Honda could have done much better. Had they done it, they would not have to sell the bike at a discounted price. It would have sold like hotcakes, but Honda did what they do the best these days, disappoint their loyal customers. I had a Honda Unicorn and Hornet 160R in the past and my dad used to ride Honda Shine, but after this, I'm never going back to Honda again.                        ",Honda

"                            Cbr1000rr-r is a sports bike with 4 stoke liquid cool engine. I have taken on rent for tour purposes. Riding experience: it gives comfort to ridder while ridding. But while driving on hill stations need to be careful at turning.Brakes, suspension, and brakes compatibility are nice.Looks is a very good and stylish look. Performance is nice and ridder will get good experience.Servicing and maintenance are a little high cost. Spare parts are not available in every outlet.                        ",Honda
                            Mileage ride if you ride with in limits.Super pickup and minus are uncomfortable in city traffic and maneuvering in traffic Weights heavy and pick up is not controllable in bumper-to-bumper trafficService networks needed and maintenance need to extra care and also looks nice and needs to get controlled in your hand while on the highway so please take care and drive otherwise ok.                        ,Honda
"                            Awesome bike!!Recommended to buy!!!Worthy bike!!Honda gave a powerful machine to Honda's customers. Love this bike.

I want to tell you everything but you won't believe that this bike gives me 20.2 kms mileage!!!                        ",Honda
